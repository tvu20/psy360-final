neutral|Chang ?
neutral|Yeah , that sounds right .
neutral|There are about twenty people named Chang who work here . What department ?
neutral|Let me think ... accounting , finance , something like that .
neutral|Eric Chang in accounting ?
neutral|That's him !
neutral|I'll call him and tell him you're here .
neutral|I appreciate your help .
neutral|Would you like to have a seat over there ? It'll just be a minute . And can I have your name ?
neutral|Here's my card .
neutral|OK . I'll have him come up to get you .

sadness|I am sorry , sir . I have to give you a ticket . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . You will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault .
neutral|Are you a goal-oriented person ?
neutral|Yes , I am . I always make a plan before I do anything .
neutral|Where do you want to be in 5 years ?
neutral|I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing .
neutral|That sounds very reasonable .
neutral|It's the most important thing to me .
neutral|If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ?
neutral|That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me .
neutral|Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them .
neutral|I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step .
neutral|What is your long-range objective ?
neutral|I haven't thought it over at all .
neutral|What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ?
neutral|I think the most important thing is the interest in the job .
neutral|I'd like to open a current account .
neutral|Certainly . May I see your social security and your ID , please .
neutral|Here you are . I wonder how much interest can I earn from a current account .
neutral|Oh , current accounts don't pay out interest .
neutral|Why is that ?
neutral|It's primarily designed for business transactions . That is , writing checks to pay for bills , buying things and sending money . We won't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account .
neutral|I see . How do I draw money for my own use then ?
neutral|Good morning , Helen .
neutral|Good morning , Steven .
neutral|So , what's the status of our advertising campaign ?
neutral|It'll be a national campaign starting next week .
neutral|What style will the ads be ?
neutral|I suggest that we focus on slice of life , showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich .
neutral|Sounds like a good idea . Will we have a new slogan ?
neutral|Definitely .
neutral|I'd like to taste some local dishes . What would you recommend ?
neutral|That's fine . You must try this dish .
neutral|Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?
neutral|It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce .
neutral|Is it good ?
neutral|Sure . It's a most popular dish .
neutral|I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together .
neutral|We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ?
neutral|What kind do you have ?
neutral|We have French and Thousand Island .
neutral|Make it Thousand Island .
neutral|Taxi !
neutral|Where will you go , sir ?
neutral|Friendship Hotel .
neutral|OK , it's not far from here .
neutral|I have something important to do , can you fast the speed ?
neutral|Sure , I'll try my best . Here we are .
neutral|How much should I pay you ?
neutral|The reading on the meter is 15 yuan .
neutral|Here's 20 yuan , keep the change .
joy|Thank you very much .
neutral|Mr . Johnson ’ s office . Cindy speaking .
neutral|Hi , Cindy . It ’ s Michael Kurt . Is Mr . Johnson in ?
neutral|No , I ’ m sorry , Mr . Kurt . He ’ s stepped out for a bit . Would you like me to have him call you ?
neutral|Yeah , that ’ ll be great . I ’ m on extension 4283 .
neutral|Hi , Mark .
neutral|Hi , Bill . I ’ d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday .
neutral|All right .
neutral|So , what do we do now ?
neutral|This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .
neutral|Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance . I understand that I ’ ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .
neutral|Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out .
neutral|Can I pay you by check ?
neutral|Sure . A check will be fine .
neutral|Is there a laundry room in the basement ?
neutral|Yes .
neutral|Can I sign the lease right now ?
neutral|Good morning ! What can I do for you ?
neutral|I'm thinking of travelling to Suzhou in July . Could you recommend some tourist programs for that ?
neutral|With pleasure . We arrange two kinds of tourist programs for Suzhou , a six-day tour by train and a five-day flying journey .
neutral|How much does a six-day tour by train cost ?
neutral|Five hundred yuan .
neutral|Does that include hotels and meals ?
neutral|Oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well .
neutral|That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ?
neutral|Eight hundred and fifty yuan .
neutral|Covering all expenses ?
neutral|Yes . But there is no half fare for children . They must pay full fare .
surprise|I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ?
neutral|Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire .
surprise|Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ?
neutral|We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes .
neutral|I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ?
neutral|Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want .
neutral|It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity .
neutral|Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days .
neutral|ABC Company , my name is Lucy . How can I help you ?
neutral|Hello , Lucy , this is Monica . I ’ m calling for the accountant position . I saw the information about the vacancy on your company ’ s website . Is it still available ?

neutral|That's fine .

neutral|Welcome to Flash Foot , sir.How can I help you ?
neutral|I ’ d like extra prints made of these photos .
neutral|Do you have your negatives ?
neutral|Yes.Here they are . I ’ Ve marked how many prints I want on each shot .
neutral|What size do you want the prints ?
neutral|Four by six , except this one . I want a ten by thirteen print of this one .

neutral|I'm interested in taking a tour to Sydney .
neutral|Well , we have a package tour there .
neutral|How much does it cost ?
neutral|$ 600 .
neutral|Does that include the insurance ?
neutral|Of course .
neutral|Hello , Mr . Wang . I am glad to meet you here at the fair .
neutral|Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ?
neutral|Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here .
neutral|Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity .
neutral|Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ?
neutral|That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad .
neutral|We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ?
neutral|That sounds good .
neutral|Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ?
neutral|Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents .
neutral|4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough .
neutral|Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase .
neutral|You mean to saya
neutral|It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ?
neutral|We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment .
neutral|All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately .
neutral|Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you .
neutral|Thank you for your help .
joy|I'm glad these batteries are on sale .
sadness|I'm sorry . These batteries are not on sale .
neutral|But that's what the ad said .
neutral|I'm sorry . If you look at the ad again , you'll see that the other brand is on sale .
neutral|Oh . You're right . I misread the ad .
neutral|Yes , many people make that mistake .
neutral|Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad .
neutral|You're right . Many ads are like that .
neutral|Well , as long as I'm here .
neutral|Just one second , and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale .
neutral|Hi , Jack , we are having a party tonight , wanna coming enjoy us ? You can bring your girlfriend , Tina .
neutral|I don't have a girlfriend . I'm single .
neutral|Oh , that's right . Well , there are going to be many beautiful girls at the party tonight , anyway .
neutral|No , I like being single . I never thought lonely , I'm focus on my career . Maybe I'll start to look for my girl when I achieve success .
neutral|Why is that ?
neutral|Because I'm living a real world , a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money . Franklin speaking the girls I've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money .
neutral|I agree , a man needs good career.But that doesn't mean he should have a little fun , too .
neutral|So , Casey , how are things going with the photos for the press kit ?
neutral|Yeah , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline .
anger|You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ?
sadness|Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . .
anger|I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time !
neutral|I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures .
anger|I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP !
neutral|Yes , sir ?
neutral|Can I have Mr . J . Smith paged ? He said he'd be in the main dining room . I'm Mr . J . B . White .
neutral|Who would you like to have paged again , sir ?
neutral|Mr . J . Smith .
neutral|Where would you like him to come ?
neutral|To the front desk .
neutral|Just a moment , please .
neutral|Can you help me find a lotion for a problem I am having ?
neutral|That ’ s what I am here for . What questions can I answer for you ?
neutral|I have poison oak , and I need help with the rash that won ’ t stop itching .
neutral|The best product is Techne , and you can buy either the lotion or cream .
neutral|Which one is best ?
neutral|The cream form is very popular .
neutral|Can I do anything else to help with the itching ?
neutral|You could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .
neutral|I appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching .
neutral|Anytime you have a question , please feel free to ask .
neutral|Excuse me . Something is wrong with my bank card . Can you help me ?
neutral|Yes . What's the problem ?
neutral|Just a mistake with my name . It should be issued as Steven , but the card is under the name ' Steven ' .
neutral|Oh , I am very sorry about that . It's our fault . I will arrange someone to correct it immediately .
neutral|OK , no problem . To err is human .
neutral|Anyway , we apologize for the inconvenience we have brought you . Please just wait for a moment , and it will be fixed .
joy|Thank you very much .

neutral|Booze !
neutral|Yeah , you ’ re right . Can ’ t go wrong with that .
neutral|Is everything to your satisfaction ?
neutral|No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh .
neutral|Oh , sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual . I will look into the matter .
neutral|This is very annoying .
neutral|I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course .
neutral|No , I don't risk it .
neutral|How about a delicious dessert then , with our compliment ?
neutral|I'm not keen on dessert as a habit . They are fattening .
neutral|I see , sir . I'm sure everything will be right next time you come .
neutral|Excuse me , are you Jane ?
neutral|No , I'm Mary .
neutral|Oh , are you in Class Four ?
neutral|No , I'm in Class There .
neutral|Excuse me , but I'm not feeling too well . I think I'm going to throw up .
neutral|There's an airsickness bag behind the seat that's in front of you .
neutral|I must've missed it .
neutral|Is this your first time flying ?
neutral|Yes . I'm going to San Francisco .
neutral|Oh , it's a beautiful city . I think you'll like it .
neutral|Hey , I'm feeling much better already .
neutral|Sometimes if you don't think about it , that sick feeling will go away on its own .
neutral|Thanks . By the way , my name is Mary .
neutral|I'm Frank . Nice to meet you .
neutral|Welcome to Al's Bakery . What can I get you ?

neutral|Will that be all ?
neutral|Yes .
neutral|Your total is forty three dollars and twenty cents .

I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy . I'd like to give you an overview of the way that the economies of seemingly unrelated countries are intertwined .

My presentation will take about two hours , but there will be a twenty-minute break in the middle . We'll stop for lunch at 12 .
neutral|You're looking rather pale , why ?
neutral|I couldn't sleep well recently .
neutral|You'd get plenty of sleep for you work so hard .
neutral|I always drink too much wine in the evening .
neutral|You shan't drink more wine in the evening .

neutral|Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account .
neutral|The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ...
neutral|Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want .
neutral|That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ?

neutral|I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices the managers offices .
neutral|Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs .
neutral|Sure thing .
neutral|What do you think of our price ?
neutral|Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ?
neutral|Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .
neutral|I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable .
neutral|I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .
neutral|I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .
neutral|I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
neutral|Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?
neutral|We've already cut down our price to cost level .
neutral|Is that all ?
neutral|Yes , this is the best we can do .
neutral|I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .
neutral|So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ?
joy|It ’ s great , dad . I don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money .
neutral|Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money .
neutral|I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ?
neutral|You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest .
neutral|But what if I need my money suddenly ?
neutral|The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM .
neutral|Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters !
neutral|Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . Let ’ s go make your first depot
joy|OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal .
neutral|Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ?
neutral|Yes , but you can't get there with out a change .
neutral|Which bus do I have to change ?
neutral|You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 .
joy|I see . Thank you .
neutral|Here we are , Joan . This is the Palace museum , also known as the Forbidden city .
joy|Oh , how splendid ! Can you take a picture of me here ?
neutral|Sure .
neutral|Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ?
neutral|We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city .
neutral|Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ?
neutral|Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right .
neutral|Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ?
neutral|Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month .
neutral|Is there anything else ? How about my salary ?
neutral|Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record .
neutral|Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ?
neutral|All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days .
joy|Okay , that's good . I get it .
surprise|Kate , you never believe what's happened .
neutral|What do you mean ?
neutral|Masha and Hero are getting divorced .
surprise|You are kidding . What happened ?
neutral|Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce .
surprise|That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ?
neutral|Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .
neutral|That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ?
neutral|Early in the New Year I guess .
neutral|Overseas operator .
neutral|I would like to make a collect call to Taipei , Taiwan , please .
neutral|Your name , please .
neutral|Tim Chen .
neutral|What's the number , please .
neutral|The area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 .
joy|The line is connected . Please go ahead .
neutral|Hello . Excuse me .
neutral|Yes . Can I help you ?
neutral|Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago .
neutral|Of course I remember you .
neutral|I think I lost my wallet here .
surprise|Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything .
surprise|Really ? You didn't find a wallet ?
neutral|No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ?
neutral|Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ?
neutral|No . It's been empty the whole time .
neutral|Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened .
neutral|I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?
neutral|No . My friend did .
neutral|Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?
neutral|No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table .
neutral|Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .
neutral|I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ?
neutral|Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that .
neutral|Should I call the police ?
neutral|You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .
neutral|Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .
neutral|I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir .
neutral|Thanks for your help .
neutral|Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ?
joy|Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt .
neutral|That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland .
joy|It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ?
neutral|Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things .
neutral|Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ?
neutral|Is fifteen dollars OK ?
neutral|Have you got change for a thousand ?
neutral|Let me see .
neutral|May I come in , Mr Sun ?
neutral|I ’ d rather you didn ’ t , Miss Yang . I ’ m very busy now .
neutral|Can I try later then ?
neutral|Yes , of course .
neutral|Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ?
neutral|Well , uh ... I ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ?
neutral|Do you mind if I sit down ?
neutral|Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ?
neutral|I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ?
neutral|Yes . But why should you want to do that ?
neutral|Do you mind if I speak frankly ?
neutral|Not at all . Go ahead .
neutral|Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?
neutral|Yes . I ’ d be delighted if you did .
neutral|Where is that ?
neutral|Take me to the airport , please .
neutral|Are you in a hurry ?
neutral|I have to be there before 17 o'clock .
neutral|We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour .
neutral|There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
neutral|I'll do my best .
neutral|Here's twenty dollars .
neutral|Do you have small bills ?
neutral|No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ?
joy|Here is your receipt . Thank you .
neutral|Recently I have been getting headache and my eyes don't seems to see focus properly .
neutral|When did you last time have your eyes checked ?
neutral|Two years ago . At that time I had no problems.Now I can ’ t even make out something ten meters away .
neutral|Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can , telling me which way the “ E ” points .
neutral|All right .
neutral|Good.Now the other eye .
neutral|Well , this one is worse .
neutral|Never mind , just read as far as you can .
neutral|I can only read the first three lines .
neutral|Is there a car park near the supermarket ?
neutral|Yes , there is an underground car park near the supermarket .
joy|I see . Thanks .
anger|Oh , come on , Ultraman !
neutral|What's up , Bro ? What's in the bulletin ?
neutral|It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today .
neutral|Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit .
neutral|Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
anger|Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either !
neutral|That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?
fear|Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner !
neutral|OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here .
neutral|How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ?
neutral|Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl .
neutral|Do you have a better plan ?
neutral|All right , all right .
neutral|Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ?
neutral|I am wondering if you do facial care ?
neutral|Yes , we do .
neutral|How much would it be ?
neutral|From 200 to 800 .
neutral|I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ?
neutral|No problem .
neutral|Can I help you , Miss ?
neutral|I would like to order 2 office-style cabinets and desk calendars . We want office-style cabinets in white . The catalogue number is 90 - f - 2356 .
neutral|How soon do you want it ?
neutral|Could you deliver it tomorrow ?
neutral|No problem .
neutral|Please handle the items carefully .
neutral|Certainly .
neutral|We will pay by collect on delivery .
neutral|I hate to do this to you , Alice , but I ’ m going to have to ask you to put in some more overtime .
neutral|Does it have to be this afternoon , Mr . Fairbanks ? I ’ Ve already made plans .
neutral|Well , I would have preferred to do it today , but if you ’ Ve already made plans , we can do it tomorrow .
neutral|I ’ d appreciate that , sir . How long do you think you ’ ll need me to stay ?
neutral|What ’ s your attitude when do wrong things at work ?
neutral|The buck stops here .
neutral|Hello ! Is your company advertising for administrative assistant on the newspapers ?

neutral|OK . I will call you soon . Bye now .

neutral|Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview .
neutral|It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time .
neutral|You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview .
neutral|The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation .
neutral|Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation .
neutral|To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression .
neutral|Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief .
neutral|It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn .
neutral|You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for .
neutral|While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately
neutral|Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description .
neutral|Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly .
neutral|Hello ?
neutral|Hi , Deborah ! This is John . I'm calling from Australia .
neutral|What are you doing in Australia ?
neutral|I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ?
neutral|Oh , right . What time is it there ?
neutral|It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ?
neutral|Yes - four o'clock in the morning .
joy|4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry .
joy|That's OK . I'm awake now .
neutral|John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ?
neutral|I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement .
fear|Jack , let ’ s go !
neutral|Oh , you are out of breath ! What happened ?
fear|Some people are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave here as soon as possible !
neutral|Take it easy . They will get caught .
neutral|Hello . May I speak to Jerry , please ?
sadness|Sorry , but he is out for lunch right now .
neutral|I see . Can you give me some idea how long he'll be back ?
neutral|I think he will be back around 2:00 . If you like , please leave your name and phone number , I'll have him call you as soon as he comes back .
joy|That's nice . My name is Steven , my phone number is 6789777 . Okay , I'll be waiting for his call . Thank you and bye !
joy|My pleasure , bye !
neutral|Excuse me , Miss .
neutral|What can I do for you ?
neutral|I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed .
neutral|What's your flight number ?
neutral|Flight CA216 to Chengdu .
neutral|Yes , it's true . It has been delayed .
neutral|Could you please tell me why ?
neutral|Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain .
neutral|How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ?
neutral|I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon .
neutral|We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ?
neutral|It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight .
neutral|Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye !
neutral|Bye
anger|What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !
neutral|I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .
anger|I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
neutral|I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ?
neutral|I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
neutral|Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?
neutral|I don't know .
neutral|I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .
neutral|What do you mean ?
neutral|We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
neutral|I have plenty of gas .
neutral|Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
neutral|So what can we do ?
neutral|Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
joy|Alright . That's a good idea .
neutral|I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
neutral|Days ?
neutral|Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .
surprise|Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .
neutral|Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .
neutral|Hey , buddy , can ’ t you see there ’ s a line ?
sadness|Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t know .
neutral|What ? You haven ’ t taken the bus before ?
sadness|No , I ’ m afraid not .
neutral|Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first .
neutral|Sorry .
neutral|It ’ s all right . Where are you going ?
neutral|I wanted to see the White House .
neutral|Oh , well you don ’ t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown .
neutral|Oh , no .
neutral|It ’ s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A .
joy|Oh , well thank you very much .
joy|You ’ re welcome .
neutral|Can I help you ?
neutral|I'd like the double cheese burger meal , please .
neutral|What kind of drink would you like with that ?
neutral|Just coke will be fine .
neutral|Would you like a super size meal ? Only 2 RIB more , you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium . And today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes .
joy|That sounds good , thanks , I'd like that . Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks .
neutral|That's not a problem , Miss . Will that be it ?
neutral|Yes , that's all .
neutral|That will be 25RMB , please
neutral|You got it .
neutral|Do you have any night tours ?
neutral|Yes , we will depart in 10 minutes .
neutral|Is that a guided tour ?
neutral|Yes , it is .
neutral|That's fine . Let's get on the bus .
neutral|I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible .
neutral|That's nice .
neutral|We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings .
neutral|Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time .
neutral|I would like to purchase some meat .
neutral|What kind of meat would you like to get today ?
neutral|First off , I'm going to need a pound of ground beef .
neutral|A pound of ground beef is $ 2.48 .
neutral|That's perfect .
neutral|What else will you be needing ?
neutral|I'm also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts .
neutral|The chicken breasts cost $ 4.05 per pound .
neutral|What's the total price for the chicken ?
neutral|It's going to be $ 12.15 .
joy|Okay , I think that will be all for me today .
neutral|I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks .
neutral|Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us .
surprise|Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market .
neutral|Do you sell direct to shops ?
neutral|Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen .
neutral|Do you keep a stock of these things ?
neutral|In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course .
neutral|That is , your commission .
neutral|Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal .
neutral|Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission .
neutral|The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much .
neutral|According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ?
neutral|We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with .
neutral|We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ...
neutral|Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?
neutral|Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect .
neutral|Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products .
neutral|Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details .
neutral|Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ?
neutral|Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction .
neutral|All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency .
neutral|Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair .
neutral|Excuse me , I ’ m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company .
neutral|Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ?
neutral|Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ’ t arrived yet .
neutral|Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ?
neutral|Have you worked out the offers . Mr . Thou ?
neutral|Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look .
neutral|Are the prices on the list firm offers ?
neutral|Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation .
neutral|I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices .
neutral|All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ?
neutral|How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan .
neutral|I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days .
neutral|Hello sir , may I help you ?
neutral|Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
neutral|I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers .
joy|Sounds good . I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range .
neutral|We have this new ETC smart phone.It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications . It also has a built-in camera , mp3 player and touch screen . It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are .
neutral|What about Wi-fi ?
neutral|Of course ! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home .
neutral|One last thing . Is it waterproof ?
anger|We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !
anger|Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
neutral|Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
anger|I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !
neutral|What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
neutral|Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?
neutral|We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
neutral|Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !
neutral|I ’ ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there .
joy|Yay !
neutral|Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ?
neutral|Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand .
neutral|From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked .
neutral|I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ?
neutral|Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats ,
neutral|So who has to stay behind ?
neutral|Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone .
neutral|Ok . I ’ ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket !
neutral|I want to rent this apartment .
joy|I ’ m glad to hear that .
neutral|How much are you asking ?
neutral|You will have to pay $ 1050 every month .
neutral|I can ’ t afford that .
neutral|What can you afford ?
neutral|I was thinking $ 800 a month .
neutral|I ’ ll need you to pay more than that .
neutral|How much more ?
neutral|How does $ 900 every month sound to you ?
neutral|I can live with that .
joy|We have a deal then .
joy|Good morning , Miss Monica . Nice to meet you again !
joy|Good morning , Mr . Thomas , it is nice to see you too .
neutral|After the internal discussion , we have all agreed that you are the most suitable person for this position among all the candidates . So , today let ’ s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . What is your expected salary ?
neutral|I ’ Ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . Depend on my work qualifications and experience , I would like to have 5000 Yuan to start .
neutral|The basic salary for your position in our company would be 4800 Yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance .
neutral|It is a bit lower than I expected . But I can accept that . What are the working hours ?
neutral|40 hours a week , Monday to Friday , 9 AM to 5 PM with one hour lunch break every day ..
neutral|Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ?
neutral|We do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn Day .
neutral|Is there probation ?
neutral|No probation is involved . If you feel good , you can start next week .
neutral|Welcome to the McDonald's . What will it be for you , madam ?
neutral|One Big Mac and French Fries .
neutral|Is there anything else ?
neutral|Give me one coke , please .
neutral|Is this to go or to eat here ?
neutral|To go , please .
neutral|That comes to four dollars and ten cents .
neutral|And can I have some ketchup , please ?
neutral|It's on the service counter over there . Please go to help yourself .
neutral|What's the name of this street ?
neutral|University Street .
neutral|Do you know of any banks near here ?
neutral|You'll see one at the corner on your right .
neutral|Hey there , you look a little lost . Are you new here ?
neutral|Yeah how ’ d you know ?
neutral|You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ?
neutral|Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ’ m not really sure where to begin .
neutral|It ’ s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ?
neutral|Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio .
neutral|In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
surprise|Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight !
neutral|It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ...
neutral|Excuse me.Could you tell me how to return to the Hilton Hotel ? I am afraid I lost my way .
neutral|Do you have a hotel card or something ?

neutral|Well , I don't understand it very well.Will you draw me a map ?
neutral|Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ?
neutral|The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street .
neutral|How long will it take me to get there ?
neutral|It's about a ten-minute walk .
joy|That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
joy|Not at all .
neutral|How does the political system work in your country ?
neutral|We have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s .
neutral|Each mp belongs to a political party , right ?
neutral|Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime Finist
neutral|What ’ s a cabinet ?
neutral|This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
neutral|Can any mp make a law ?
neutral|Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law .
neutral|I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
neutral|Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to .
neutral|How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
neutral|They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Voters who often change the party they vote for are Calle
neutral|How was your interview ?
neutral|Pretty good . The HR manager asked me the usual questions . Then he wondered why I had decided to leave my previous job .
neutral|What did you say ?
neutral|I told him that I hadn ’ t got a raise for three years . I also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years .
neutral|Did he want to know the reasons ?
neutral|Yes . I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only .
neutral|That ’ s sex discrimination . When will you get the reply ?
neutral|In a couple of days , I was told .
joy|Wish you good luck !
joy|Thank you .
neutral|What qualities do you think a senior executive should possess ?
neutral|Generally speaking , he needs creativity , the ability to communicate , sense of personal responsibilities , the ability to solve problems and so on .

surprise|Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
joy|snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
joy|that's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .
neutral|Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
joy|why not ? it's so cool .
neutral|but it will pose a risk to your health .
surprise|pardon ?
neutral|i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems .
neutral|well , I didn't realize that .
neutral|I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
neutral|oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
joy|yes , good luck , Maria .
neutral|I ’ m a new student . My name ’ s Robert .
joy|Nice to meet you . My name ’ s Sophie .

neutral|No , I often go there with my friends .
neutral|Hi there ! I am looking for a new car . I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in .
neutral|I see . You are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale ! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it ’ s the end of the year .
joy|Perfect ! I like this one .
neutral|That is the Ford Focus . A very light but powerful vehicle . It comes with dual side airbags , power steering and power windows , tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission .
joy|Sounds like a good car ! How many miles to the gallon ?
neutral|It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .
joy|That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ’ s under the hood ?
joy|A very powerful 2.5- liter turbocharged engine , Trust me , this car is fast !
neutral|Now for the most difficult question . What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
neutral|Very affordable mam . You can take it out of this lot today with 0 % down payment and no interest for the first year ! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
joy|Great ! Let ’ s do it !
neutral|I wonder if you could help me , I'm looking for a room .
neutral|Well , I have got a vacancy .
neutral|What sort of price are you asking ?
neutral|Eight dolls fifty a week excluding laundry .
neutral|Would it be convenient to see the room ?
neutral|Can you call back later ? We're right in the middle of lunch .
neutral|Could you give me an expense report ? I would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season .
neutral|Here you are . Do you need glue ?
neutral|That is very kind of you . I ’ m just running out of glue .
neutral|You ’ re welcome .
neutral|IBA , Jane speaking . How can I help you ?
neutral|Hello . I'd like to speak to someone regarding my card .
neutral|Sorry , I'm not quite sure if I understand . In what way , Sir ? Has your card been stolen ?
neutral|No , no . Nothing at all like that . It's just that I applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but I'm still waiting for my card .
neutral|Oh , I see , Sir . Well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card .
neutral|Yes , my application was accepted last Friday . Now it's Wednesday , that's more than 5 days .
neutral|Sorry , Sir , but it's 5 working days . This does not include weekends , so your card should be with you later this week .
neutral|Of course ! How silly of me ! Yes , 5 working days would mean this Friday , at the earliest . I see . I'm sorry to trouble you .

neutral|You should do one of the two things - either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company .
neutral|Shall we leave it to the brokers ?
neutral|Yes . They usually do it .
neutral|Do they charge for that ?
neutral|Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service .
neutral|Is it the same in America ?
neutral|They do the work without charge to the importer .
neutral|It's part of their service , isn't it ?
neutral|Exactly .
neutral|Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ?
neutral|No , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment .
neutral|I see . By the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ?

neutral|Will you take long ?
neutral|No ! Five minutes I promise !
anger|Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !
neutral|Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liquid foundation .
anger|Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon !
anger|What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...
anger|Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon !
neutral|Can I borrow five bucks ?

neutral|Where are you living now ?
neutral|Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day .
neutral|How are you going to find an apartment ?

joy|no , it's definitely my turn to treat you ... you paid last time !

neutral|ok ... sure .
neutral|I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine .
neutral|What ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?
neutral|Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?
neutral|Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .
neutral|Hey , Jim . It's time to wake up and get out of bed .
neutral|Do I have to get up now ?
neutral|You'd better get up , or you'll be late .
neutral|What're you talking about ? My alarm even hasn't gone off yet .
neutral|Yes , it did . It went off thirty minutes ago . You slept right through it . You're like a dead person while you sleep .
neutral|I must have slept right through it .
neutral|Rise and shine ! Sleepyhead !
neutral|Just let me sleep five more minutes .
neutral|The early bird gets the worm .
neutral|I know , I know . But I don't want any worms .
joy|Ha ! Ha ! If you don't make an effort now , later on it'll be a lot tougher for you .
neutral|What shall we do tonight ?
neutral|How about the cinema ?
neutral|That's a good idea . We haven't seen a film for ages . What would you like to see ?
neutral|Oh I don't know . Titanic ?
neutral|Titanic ? That old film ? but I've seen it before !
neutral|I ’ Ve been told you might have a vacant room .
neutral|Yes . I have a spare room .
neutral|How much are you asking ?
neutral|10.00 dollars a night .
neutral|Could I see the room , please ?
neutral|Sure.Come on in .
neutral|Sit down , please . What's wrong with you ?
neutral|I feel cold , and I'm shivering . I have a terrible headache and a sore throat .
neutral|How long have you been like that ?
neutral|About a day .
neutral|Let me have a look at your throat first . Please open your mouth and say " ah " .
neutral|Ah ...
neutral|And show me your tongue ... Thank you . That'll do . You have slight tonsillitis , and your throat is inflamed . How is your appetite ?
neutral|Not so good .
neutral|Now , let me take your temperature . Please put this thermometer under your armpit and let me feel your pulse ?
neutral|Your pulse is weak .
neutral|Do I have a temperature , doctor ?
neutral|Yes , you have a high fever . I'd like to give you a blood test .
surprise|Yikes ! What was that noise ?
neutral|I had to blow my nose .
neutral|Did you have to blow right next to the phone ?
neutral|Did you hear that ?
neutral|Of course I heard that . I thought a plane had crashed into your house .
neutral|It wasn't that loud .
neutral|I will blow my nose sometime for you , and you'll see .
neutral|Okay . I'll take your word for it .

neutral|Right away , sir .
neutral|Is this amount correct ?
neutral|Yes , sir , it is .
joy|Thank you , the service was good
joy|Please come again .
neutral|Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive .
neutral|What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them .
neutral|But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past .
neutral|Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds .
neutral|Okay , well I ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position .
neutral|Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify .
neutral|Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details .
neutral|Could I first ask about the remuneration package ?
neutral|Yes , of course . That ’ s quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance also .
neutral|I understand . And are there other bonuses included ?
neutral|Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date .
neutral|Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me .
neutral|Excellent . Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ?
neutral|We need to take the accounts system offline to carry out the upgrade . But don't worry , it won't cause too much inconvenience . We're going to do it over the weekend .
neutral|How long will the system be down for ?
neutral|We'll be taking everything offline in about two hours ' time . It'll be down for a minimum of twelve hours . If everything goes according to plan , it should be up again by 6 pm on Saturday .
neutral|That's fine . We've allowed forty-eight hours to be on the safe side .
neutral|Welcome to IBA . Can I help you ?
neutral|Yes , please . I'm here for an International Settlement . Our company has to effect payment , and it needs to be done today . Here's the advice slip for the payment .
neutral|Thanks . I'm sorry to say that you need to get this stamped . There is no stamp on this slip and it is essential before I can process it for you .
neutral|I see . So , I need to stamp it . And sign it too ?
neutral|Yes , that's right . Down here , at the bottom right hand corner to show that you agree to pay the printed amount .
neutral|I'll go back to the office and get it sorted and pop back later . Thanks , bye for now .
neutral|That's the warehouse where the large items of office equipment are stored .
neutral|If I ordered a desk today , how would it be before I got delivery in Scotland ?
neutral|Well , I think perhaps you'd better speak to our Production Manager , Mr . Yao . You'll meet him when we go over to the factory .
neutral|Excuse me . I have just missed the connection plane due to the heavy fog in London . Can I change my ticket now ?

neutral|How much does it cost for a bus pass ?
neutral|It'll be $ 65 for a monthly pass .

neutral|The pass is free .

neutral|Okay , I'll get you one .
neutral|I see there are some workmen on the site . When is the building work due to start ?

neutral|About ten weeks in total if everything goes according to plan .
neutral|I'm sure it will . So , we should be able to start moving the machinery in during week 34 . I'll confirm that date with our suppliers .

neutral|I need to set up an appointment to get my hair fixed .
neutral|For what day ?
neutral|Tuesday morning .
neutral|Have you bought a bus pass yet ?
neutral|I'm not getting one .
neutral|Why is that ?
neutral|It's cheaper if I don't buy one .
neutral|Buying a bus pass will save you money .
neutral|How do you figure that ?
neutral|There's no limit to how often you can use your bus pass .
surprise|Really ?
neutral|Plus , you don't have to use change for the bus anymore .
joy|I like that .
neutral|You want to buy one now ?
neutral|I'm going to .
neutral|Are you ready to order , sir ?
neutral|Yes , I would like a roast duck and my friend wants steaks .
neutral|How do you like your steaks ?

neutral|Well , it's eaten my card ! It won't give it back !
neutral|I see ... calm down , don't worry . May I ask what were you doing when it took your card ?
neutral|Yes . I was only entering my PIN . I'm terrible at remembering it , I'm so forgetful , you see .
neutral|Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ?
neutral|Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it .
neutral|Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure . If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you .
neutral|Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ?
neutral|Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people .
neutral|I'd better try harder to memorise my PIN in future . Thanks .

joy|I've come to make sure that your stay in Beijing is a pleasant one .
joy|Thank you so much .
neutral|David , we have been doing business for three years , haven't we ?
neutral|Yes , I'm glad we've had very pleasant cooperation in the previous years . And your achievement for promoting our clothes was great in the three years .
neutral|So , I wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market . If you give us the agency , that will be more substantial for our cooperation .
neutral|To be frank , you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country . I'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent .

neutral|Excuse me .

neutral|Oh , let's see what's wrong .
neutral|Where can I find the produce ?
neutral|Aisle A is where you'll find all the produce .
neutral|What sales do they have today ?
neutral|I'm sure something is on sale . Please check with the produce person .
neutral|Hello , this is Steven from Blue Sky Co . May I speak to Mr . James ?
neutral|Speaking .
neutral|Excuse my troubling you . You purchased our products last year and now I am following up to find out about their workings . Are they still in good condition now ?
neutral|Yeah , exactly ! I bought them last year . En ... at present , they are still in good state .
neutral|That's it ! All of them have first-class quality and performance . Besides , we adopt advanced technology . Now we have developed new products . They are much better than what you have bought .
neutral|Your company is developing so fast . Maybe later on I will plan to buy more .
joy|That's great ! Thanks for your support . If any , please remember to call us . I am afraid I have to say goodbye now ! Bye , Mr . James !

neutral|Sorry , we haven't made the decision at all . But we should be making the decision by the end of this week . And we'll get in touch with you once we make it .
neutral|Do you have any questions we didn't cover in the interview ?
neutral|No .
neutral|Thank you , I am looking forward to hearing from you . Bye-bye .

joy|I like the cool smell , too .
neutral|So how can I make it ?
neutral|First you make a list of what you wanna buy ...
neutral|But I ’ Ve gotta have the budge before anything else .
neutral|Well , that ’ s a problem , isn ’ t it ?
neutral|Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ?
neutral|No , I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ?
neutral|Yeah , I worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant .
neutral|What was that like ?
neutral|It was always very busy there .
neutral|What did you do ?
neutral|I stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
neutral|Did you get any perks on the job ?
neutral|Yeah , I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free .
neutral|Hi . May I help you ?
neutral|Yes . What's the buying rate for euro ?
neutral|1.15 U . S . dollars to the euro .
neutral|Okay . I'd like to change some euro into US dollars , please .
neutral|Sure . How much would you like to change ?
neutral|Six hundred euro .
neutral|Very good . May I see your passport ?
neutral|Here you are .
neutral|How would you like your bills ?
neutral|In fifties please .
neutral|Why are you reading the classifieds ? What do you need ?
neutral|I'm looking for a bookcase , but I don't want to buy a new one .
neutral|Are you having any luck ?
neutral|Not really . There aren't any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I'll go to them .
neutral|Do you mind if I go with you ?
neutral|Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
neutral|I learned to negotiate from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store .
neutral|What happened ?
neutral|I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
neutral|Do you do a lot of your shopping online ?
neutral|Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but lat
neutral|No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never know who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ?
neutral|Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to sho
neutral|I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological .
neutral|I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people .
neutral|So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
neutral|Sure . I ’ d love to join you . Can we stop by the computer store ? I just want to see if they have something .
neutral|Sure . While you ’ re in the computer store . I will visit the book store opposite . I like to browse through their books and see if they have anything interesting .
neutral|Ok . I ’ Ve finished online . Let ’ s go . I ’ ll just get some money and my credit card .
neutral|Thanks for reminding me . I had forgotten to get mine .
neutral|Please help yourself at your dishes . I hope you ’ ll enjoy what you ’ Ve got .
joy|It suits my taste . You are really a good cook .
neutral|Would you like to try my special recipe ?
neutral|Wow , let me try . It tastes nice . How did you make it ?
neutral|It ’ s as easy as pie . I always follow recipes .
neutral|Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ?
neutral|Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily .
neutral|But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority .
neutral|More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you .
neutral|Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ?
neutral|It depends . If it has something special or useful , I suggest you send it out .
neutral|Taylor , can you tell me how to apply for a job on the Internet ?
neutral|Just fill out an application .
neutral|Do I have to send an E-mail ?
neutral|You are expected to know the E-mail address of the unit .
neutral|But I still don't know which unit is in need of staff .
neutral|Send out an application through Job-wanted on the website .
neutral|Can any unit see my information ?
neutral|It's a two-way choice . And your application will be read .
neutral|Which websites offer this service ?
neutral|Sina , 21st Century Talent Net , and a few others .
neutral|Thank you .
anger|Don ’ t throw your weight around . I can ’ t bear you any more .
anger|I dare you to say that again .
neutral|Were you a leader when you were in college ?
neutral|Yes . I was Propaganda department minister of our university .
neutral|Did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
neutral|No . It ’ s a pity about it .
neutral|Were you involved in any club activities at your university ?
neutral|Yes . I was a member of the basketball Society . I like playing basketball .
neutral|What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?
neutral|I sometimes played basketball and sometimes played football .
neutral|You want to argue your ticket today ?
neutral|Yes . That is why I'm here .
neutral|Tell me your argument .
neutral|I was pulled over for allegedly speeding .
neutral|Are you sure you weren't speeding ?
neutral|To be honest , I really wasn't .
neutral|What speed were you going ?
neutral|I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 .
neutral|I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here .
neutral|What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ?
neutral|Don't worry about it .
joy|I'm so glad for your help .
neutral|Annie , do you like shopping online ?
neutral|Yes , I like it , because it's convenient .
neutral|Last week , I tried to buy a new cellphone online , but I didn't know how to pay for it .
neutral|First , you should open an account at the online bank . After that , you can buy anything you want online .
neutral|Are there many things online ?
neutral|Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online ! ( They log in a shopping website . )
neutral|That's amazing . Oh , an on line virtual supermarket ?
neutral|Let's click to check it out .
neutral|Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets .
neutral|Ah , Bob . Just the person I wanted to see .
neutral|So what is it ?
neutral|You gotta help me out this time , buddy .
neutral|Another tough thing , I guess .
surprise|Hey ! What happened ? ! My song was only half way through and it skipped to the next song .
surprise|I don't know what happened !
neutral|You cancelled the song , didn't you , Jack ?
neutral|No , I didn't . Really !
neutral|Then , is the machine broken or ...
neutral|Good evening , Do you have a reservation ?
neutral|Yes . The reservation under Mr . Watson .
neutral|Ah , yes , a table for four at 8
neutral|Em , no , thanks . I think we'll go straight to the table , By the way . may I check my overcoat here ?
neutral|Certainly , sir . We'll keep it in the cloakroom for you . Here is your number . When you leave , show it to the waiter behind the counter , please .
neutral|Thank you . Could you show us to our table now ?
neutral|Would you please follow me , please ?
joy|Thank you .
neutral|This is your table . It's Number 10 .
neutral|Hello , ma ’ am . Can I help you ?

neutral|It fits well . I like it a lot . What do you think ?
joy|You look pretty in red .
joy|Oh , it ’ s my favorite . How much is it ?
neutral|$ 29.99 .
joy|Okay . I ’ ll take it . Thank you very much for your help .
joy|You ’ re welcome .
neutral|Do you have any cars available ?
neutral|We have only one mid-size car left .
neutral|Great , what's the rate per day ?
neutral|It's 40 $ plus tax per day on limited mileage .
neutral|I'm going to need it for three days .
neutral|Can I see your driver's license ?
neutral|Sure , here is my driver's license .
neutral|Please sign here .
neutral|Are you ready to order ?
joy|I think that we have a pretty good idea of what we would like to order .
neutral|Let me tell you about the specials of the day , which are chicken in a wine sauce with capers , and grilled garlic shrimp .
neutral|I was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce .
neutral|The chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests .
neutral|I am a vegetarian . Do you have any vegetarian selections ?
neutral|You could choose the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza or the goat cheese and candied walnut salad .
neutral|I think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza .
neutral|That is a good selection , and I can bring your salads now or serve them with your entree .
neutral|You can bring us our salads when you bring us our entree .
neutral|I can't open this email attachment our Paris office has sent me .
neutral|Are you sure you're using the right program ?
neutral|Well , yes it's definitely the same program but I might have the wrong version . Their system is newer than ours .
neutral|That's why you can't open it . You'll have to upgrade before you can read the file .
neutral|What kind of character do you think you have ?
neutral|Generally speaking , l am an open-minded person .
neutral|What is your strongest trait ?
neutral|Cheerfulness and friendliness .
neutral|How would your friends or colleagues describe you ?
neutral|They say Mr . Sun is a friendly , sensitive , caring and determined person .
neutral|What personality do you admire ?
neutral|I admire a person who is honest , flexible and easy-going .
neutral|How do you get along with others ?
neutral|I get on well with others .
neutral|Hi , I need to make an appointment to see the doctor .
neutral|What seems to be the problem ?
neutral|I have a rash that I need a doctor to look at .
neutral|Do you have a fever with that rash ?
neutral|No , it just itches a lot .
neutral|I have openings on Tuesday or Wednesday . Which would be best for you ?
neutral|I need an appointment on Tuesday .
neutral|Fine , I am putting you down for 9
neutral|I would like to see Dr . Jones .
neutral|I can schedule you with him with no problem . We look forward to seeing you .
surprise|Wow ! What's the hold up ?
neutral|It ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer .
neutral|Really ? Then , I guess I won ’ t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
neutral|Actually , you might because there ’ s a big convention in town this weekend .
neutral|I ’ m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something .
neutral|Hello , how can I help you today ?
neutral|I'd like to withdraw some money from my account .
neutral|Please fill out this slip stating how much you wish to withdraw .
neutral|Well , actually , it's quite a substantial amount . Here's my Bank Book . Will that cause a problem ?

neutral|Well , I walk every day .
joy|It's a good diet and a regular exercise .
joy|Yes , quite right .
neutral|I am sorry , but I cannot stay for the rest of class today .
neutral|Why do you need to leave early ?
neutral|I don ’ t feel so good .
neutral|What doesn ’ t feel right ?
neutral|I feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach .
neutral|Perhaps you should get checked out at the Student Health Center before you go home .
neutral|I have some medicine at home that I could take .
neutral|Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ?
neutral|Thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home .
neutral|We hope that you are feeling better soon . E-mail me if you have any questions .
neutral|Your boyfriend is so considerate to you . When do you plan to marry ?
sadness|It ’ s still up in the air . There is something wrong between us .
neutral|We're considering of ordering 200 computers , but I'm wondering about the price you'll possibly offer .
neutral|Our price will be not less than $ 5000 .
neutral|Your price is higher than I expected . Could you give us a little discount ?
neutral|This is already our best price .
neutral|But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order .
neutral|Well , what would you suggest ?
neutral|Could you make it $ 4500 ?
neutral|I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . This is the best price we can quote .
neutral|Can we meet each other half way ?
neutral|What do you mean ?
neutral|Let's close the deal at $ 4800 , OK ?
neutral|You drive a hard bargain ! OK , that's a deal .
sadness|I'm now on the Songshan airport getting ready for departure . I realized that I might have left my watch .
neutral|Yes , Ma'am . May I have your name and room number ?
neutral|My name is Terry . I stayed last night in your hotel in room 132 .
neutral|What kind of watch is it ?
neutral|It's a brand-new Seiko wrist watch .
neutral|Yes , we have it .
joy|Oh , I'm glad to hear that . Would you kindly send it to the Hilton Hotel ?
neutral|What are your thoughts on the apartment ?
joy|I think that it ’ s absolutely gorgeous .
neutral|There aren ’ t any problems with the apartment ?
neutral|I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems .
neutral|What problems ?
neutral|I did notice a few stains in the carpet .
neutral|We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in .
neutral|You will ?
neutral|Yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ?
neutral|That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment .
joy|I ’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing .
joy|It is . I love it .
neutral|That China-gown of Tang-Dynasty style is so beautiful . Would you show it to me , please ?
neutral|Absolutely . Here it is .
neutral|Could I try it on ?
neutral|Please do , the fitting-room is over there .
neutral|It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ?
neutral|I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ?
neutral|OK . How much does it cost ?
neutral|It's 486 yuan .
neutral|Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ?
neutral|As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap .
neutral|Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling .
neutral|So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide .
neutral|The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ?
neutral|To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken .
neutral|That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut .
neutral|I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion .
neutral|Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ?
neutral|Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ?
neutral|Good . Friday morning at 9 .
neutral|Good morning .
neutral|Good morning.This is Mary.Can I speak to Anne please ?

neutral|Late night ?
neutral|Yeah , I got home around two .
neutral|We've been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now , and there still isn't a bus in sight .
neutral|I'm afraid we'll be late for the party .
neutral|Have you got the time , Tom ?
anger|Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch !
neutral|But you bought it only last month .
neutral|Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired .
neutral|How long will it take us to get there ?
neutral|I think about ten minutes by bus .
neutral|It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain .
neutral|Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus .
neutral|Hi , Mr . Smith . I'm Doctor Hawkins . Why are you here today ?
neutral|I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up .
neutral|Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year .
neutral|I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?
neutral|Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good .
neutral|Ok .
neutral|Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ?
neutral|Yes .
neutral|Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit .
neutral|I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit .
neutral|Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave .
neutral|Ok , thanks doctor .
neutral|Good afternoon . Mr . Tylor's office ?
neutral|I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension .
neutral|I'm sorry , but could you please transfer this call to Mr . Tylor's office ?
neutral|Sure , please hold on .
neutral|Thank you .
neutral|Now Mr . Tylor's on the line . Go ahead , please .
joy|You are so kind , you helped me a lot .
joy|You are welcome . Bye !
neutral|Good afternoon , Lexington Software . Angelina Dawson , how can I help ?
neutral|Hello , this is Quinn from IBA .
neutral|Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ?
neutral|I'm afraid so , yes .
neutral|Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ?
neutral|Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake .
neutral|What do you recommend we do ?
neutral|I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .
neutral|I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now .
neutral|Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache .
neutral|You should go to the dentist .
neutral|I hate dentists .
neutral|Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
neutral|It always hurts . I hate going .
neutral|Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
neutral|O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go .
neutral|Good . You'll feel better after you do .
neutral|Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please .
neutral|Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm .
neutral|How long does it take to get there ?
neutral|About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .
neutral|Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !
neutral|Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .
joy|Great ! I ’ ll take it .
neutral|Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train !
neutral|I understand . Thank you very much !
joy|Have a great trip .
neutral|I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend .
neutral|A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ?
neutral|The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend .
neutral|So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ?
neutral|It sounds like it will be .
neutral|I really hope it doesn't get cold .
neutral|That would ruin things , I want to go so badly .
neutral|The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know .
neutral|That is true . The weather is constantly changing .
neutral|It would be nice if the weather would never change .
neutral|That would be great , then we could plan things sooner .
neutral|True . Predictable weather would make life easier .
neutral|Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other .
neutral|If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company .
neutral|Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .
neutral|But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency .
neutral|I doubt that .
neutral|Do you eat a lot of healthy food ?
neutral|Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind .
neutral|You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt .
neutral|What's special about these things ?
neutral|Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .
joy|Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now .
sadness|I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job .
neutral|You need to take a break , maybe a vacation .
sadness|Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .
surprise|Is that so ?
neutral|Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .
neutral|Have you decided ?
neutral|Yes . I want to get a better job .
neutral|Could you tell me why you want to quit ?
neutral|I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
neutral|Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?
neutral|I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
neutral|OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
neutral|Thank you so much for your advice .
neutral|And every best wish for your new job .
neutral|Thank you .
neutral|The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ?
neutral|Let me see . Oh , No . 11 .
neutral|Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in .
neutral|Seats No . 20 and 21 . It ’ s nice that we ’ Ve got a window seat .
neutral|Let's put our suitcases on the rack .
neutral|Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being .
neutral|All right .
neutral|So , how should we get to the theatre ?
neutral|Let's take the bus .
anger|I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .
neutral|It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .
anger|It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
neutral|We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
neutral|Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .
neutral|If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?
neutral|We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .
neutral|I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .
neutral|Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
neutral|It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .
joy|Thanks , that was nice of you .
neutral|See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !
neutral|Let's go over this plan again .
neutral|From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg .
neutral|And that is mostly flat , right ?
neutral|Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba .
neutral|And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ?
neutral|That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop .
neutral|It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride .
neutral|Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ?
neutral|Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ?
anger|I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her .
neutral|I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet .
neutral|Anyhow , I'd like to change our room .
neutral|No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from .
neutral|All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep .
neutral|Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know .
neutral|It's time for bed .
neutral|I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired .
neutral|It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow .
neutral|I'm not going to be able to fall asleep .
neutral|Why don't you try counting sheep ?
neutral|I've tried that before . It really doesn't work .
neutral|That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed .
neutral|Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ?
neutral|If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night .
neutral|I promise I'll go to sleep soon .
neutral|No , you're going to sleep now , so good night .
joy|See you in the morning .
neutral|I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility .
neutral|How about your psychological resilience ?
neutral|I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary .
neutral|How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ?
neutral|I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way .
neutral|You seem to be a kind-hearted lady .
neutral|Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature .
neutral|Please tell me your weaknesses if you can .
neutral|I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection .
neutral|Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you .
neutral|Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ?
neutral|I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting .
neutral|Fine . At 3:30 ?
neutral|I believe we ' Ve met before . My name's David .
neutral|Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank .
joy|Oh , I remember now.Very nice to meet you again .
joy|Nice meeting you , too .
neutral|I made my little brother cry .
anger|Shame on you !
neutral|I need some mascara . Do you have good thickening mascara ?
neutral|Of course . Here is our thickening mascara . We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes .
neutral|Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ?
neutral|We have a very wide selection of colors . And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ?
neutral|Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first .
neutral|I can help you with that .
joy|Thank you .
neutral|Is this the baggage claim area for flight KB256 ?
neutral|Yes , we are on the same plane .
neutral|But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami .
neutral|So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area .
neutral|Yes.It ' s quite troublesome .
neutral|Why not go and find a porter ?
neutral|Billy , you don ’ t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school .
neutral|But Mom ! Today we ’ re playing football ! I love football !
neutral|You ’ Ve got a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ’ s that on your arm ?
neutral|I don ’ t know . It was there when I woke up this morning .
neutral|It ’ s rash . I ’ d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ?
neutral|I bashed it against the chair in my room .
neutral|Does it hurt ?
neutral|A little , but not much .
neutral|Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast .
neutral|If I ’ m better this afternoon , can I go to school ?
neutral|If you are better , but I doubt you will be .
neutral|This is your schedule .
joy|You're going out of your way for us , I believe .
joy|You are our honored guests .
neutral|Are there any vacancies still available ?
neutral|Yes . We need a plumber here .
neutral|I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager .
neutral|I am sorry . They are not available now .
neutral|My name is Mary , and I will be your waitress tonight .
joy|Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant .
neutral|Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ?
joy|Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ?
neutral|There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table .
neutral|The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ?
joy|You know , that is one of my favorites !
neutral|OK , I'll take one order of that .
neutral|You could choose another appetizer for half price to share .
joy|Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings .
sadness|I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine .
neutral|What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?
neutral|Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?
neutral|Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .
neutral|I would like to speak to you , if you don ’ t mind .
neutral|What would you like to speak to me about ?
neutral|I would like to talk to you about this year ’ s election .
neutral|Is that right ?
neutral|I am a volunteer for this year ’ s campaign .
neutral|That ’ s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand .
neutral|I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it .
neutral|That ’ s fantastic .
neutral|Are you planning on voting ?
neutral|I ’ m going to vote .
neutral|Go to your polling place early on Election Day .
joy|I will . Good luck with your volunteering .
anger|We hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future .
neutral|Yes . I promise it will not happen again .
neutral|We look forward to your settlement at an early date .
neutral|We will inform you as soon as possible .
neutral|Hello , Steven . How do you get along with your job ?
neutral|Actually , I learn many things from it . I find that I am a quick learner in new things .
neutral|Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ?
neutral|At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement .
joy|Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance .
joy|Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job .
neutral|I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work .
neutral|OK , let's go .
neutral|Where on earth are we ?
neutral|Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city .
neutral|What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ?
neutral|I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge .
neutral|Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres .
neutral|It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map .
neutral|Hello . Front desk .
neutral|Yes . This is Bob Robinson . I ’ m calling from room number 627 .
neutral|Hi , Bob . What can I do for you ?
neutral|Is it possible to change to another room ?
neutral|Could you please tell me why ?
neutral|My room is facing the swimming pool . It ’ s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator .
neutral|So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor .
neutral|You ’ re right .
neutral|Okay . Let me check for a room on the first floor .
neutral|Thank you .
neutral|I ’ Ve only two rooms on the first floor . How about room 108 ?
neutral|That ’ s fine . Can I move now ?
neutral|Sure . I ’ ll send the bellman to help you .
joy|Oh , thank you kindly .
joy|You ’ re welcome .
neutral|How long will it take for our order to be delivered ?
neutral|Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles .
neutral|Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control .
neutral|No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go .
neutral|Now you're my boss , Mr . Henry .
neutral|Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
neutral|No , nothing in particular .
neutral|You may ask questions about us , if you have any .
neutral|All right . When can I start ?
neutral|What are you doing here today ?
neutral|I would like to fight my ticket .
neutral|Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ?
neutral|Yes , the officer is here today .
neutral|What's your case ?
neutral|I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did .
neutral|Do you believe that the officer lied ?
neutral|There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying .
neutral|Your license plate was caught on camera ?
neutral|A picture of my license plate was never taken .
neutral|Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go .
joy|Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me .
neutral|Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ?
neutral|Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long .
neutral|Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .
neutral|That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options .
neutral|What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ?
neutral|Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .
neutral|So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
neutral|Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .
neutral|Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .
neutral|After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .
neutral|what shall we do after the volleyball match ?
neutral|how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym .
joy|that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
neutral|me , too . What did you have in mind ?
neutral|I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must .
joy|I agree . They're very lovely , especially " Huan Huan " .
neutral|is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?
neutral|the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .
neutral|oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?
neutral|I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .
neutral|any other ideas ?
neutral|there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .
joy|it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have .
anger|Mom ! I hate eating vegetables !
neutral|You don ’ t have to eat them . I don ’ t mind .
neutral|Thanks mom ! Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake !
neutral|No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables .
anger|But I don ’ t like them ! It ’ s not fair !
neutral|You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake .
neutral|Ok ... actually , I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots , buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower .
neutral|I ’ ll remember that for next time . You ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . OK ?
joy|Thanks mom !
neutral|It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range .
neutral|It ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ’ s your general impression , may I ask ?
neutral|Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model .
neutral|That ’ s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago .
neutral|The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess .
neutral|Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned .
neutral|Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible .
neutral|Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature .
joy|Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future .
neutral|Is the factory fully-automated ?
neutral|Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually .
neutral|What about supply of parts to the production line ?
neutral|Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line .
neutral|What about the smaller components ?
neutral|They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory .
joy|I'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee .
neutral|Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates .
neutral|That's not why . This way I can see how you guys do this sort of thing .
neutral|I guess . Don't you have reunions in Taiwan ?
neutral|Definitely . Every year . But just for our forty-person class .
neutral|Ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year .
neutral|What does your job involve ?
neutral|I'm the Project Manager so I have to make sure our projects run smoothly . I work with three Project Engineers . They take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business .
neutral|How many languages can you speak ?
neutral|Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French .
neutral|You mean you can read and write both of them ?
neutral|No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French .
neutral|Can you read and write English well ?
neutral|I can speak the language better than read and write .
neutral|Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ?
neutral|I think so . I used to be an interpreter .
neutral|Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ?
neutral|The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm .
neutral|What can I get for you ? Here is the menu .
neutral|Let me have a look . Well , how many kinds of steaks do you have ?
neutral|We have sirloin steaks , pepper steak , and filet steak .
neutral|Is there something go with the filet steak ?
neutral|Yes , we have various sauces . What about the gravy ?
neutral|Are you ready to go shopping ?
neutral|Just a minute . I need to make a list of thinks that we need .
neutral|Good idea . Have you written down potatoes , carrots , and onions ?
neutral|I don ’ t have onions on my list . I ’ ll add them . We should get some tea . Is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ?
neutral|Let ’ s get both . We need some coffee too . Is that on your list ?
neutral|Yes , it is . Here ’ s my list . Is there anything that I ’ Ve forgotten ?
neutral|I think you ’ Ve got everything . I want to got some chocolate and some cheese .
neutral|What kind of cheese do you want .
neutral|I ’ m not sure . I ’ ll decide at the cheese counter , when I can see what they have . Have we got enough money ?
neutral|We don ’ t have enough cash , so I ’ ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . Where are the car keys ?
neutral|I ’ Ve got them there . Shall I drive ?
neutral|Hello , can you tell me how to use the telephone ?
neutral|If you want to order meals , call 8801.If you need other help , call 8803 and someone will be there .
neutral|Thank you so much . By the way , is there a mail service ?
neutral|Yes , you can take your letters to the counter over there .
neutral|Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ?
neutral|Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ?
neutral|Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
neutral|Yes , it will print immediately .
neutral|How many years have you done business with China ?
neutral|Let me see , about five years , we established our business relationship with Hua Mei of China Import & Export Corporation in 2003 .
neutral|Do you have any difficulties in doing business in China ? You know the Chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ?
neutral|I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners . They have always followed the contract strictly . We can do business directly with the corporation . As I mentioned before , the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies .
neutral|Well , it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma . Does it influence your business in China ?
neutral|Actually not at present . But we are afraid it will . You know policies influence business to some extent . I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . China is really a large market . We don't want to lose it .
neutral|Thank you .
neutral|You're welcome .
neutral|Give me a pack of first-class stamps , please .
neutral|Here you are . That will be five dollars . Anything else ?
neutral|Yes . I want some post cards and some airmail stamps . I want to send some letters to South America .
neutral|Just a moment , I'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to South America .
neutral|Can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to Colombia ? Also , I what to know how long it will take .
neutral|Do you have the package with you ? I would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost .
neutral|Do you insure package ?
neutral|Yes . All you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for .
neutral|Is there a way that I can be sure that the people in South america receive my package ?
neutral|The post office rarely loses package . You can , however , request a rectum receipt .
neutral|One last question-what are your hours ?
neutral|We open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon .
joy|Thank you , you helped me a lot .
neutral|Hello , thank you for taking the time to interview me .
neutral|Hi there , I ’ m Bill Gotcha , the owner of Gotcha Enterprises . Did you find your way here OK ?
neutral|Your assistant gave wonderful directions .
neutral|Why are you switching jobs at this point in your career ?
neutral|Our Company is moving overseas and I wish to stay in the United States .
neutral|What are you best at ?
neutral|I am good at organizing systems that have been having problems .
neutral|What is your biggest challenge in terms of skills ?
neutral|I don ’ t like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy .
joy|That is good to hear !
neutral|Good morning . SRC international . How may I help you ?
neutral|Good morning . I'd like to speak to Peter . Chen Please .
neutral|Certainly . Who should I say is calling ?
neutral|This is Tim . Hunter from Hunter industries .
neutral|And what is it regarding please ?
neutral|We have an appointment for this afternoon . Mr . Chen will know why I'm calling .
neutral|Of course , Please hold the line Mr . Hunter .
neutral|Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan .
neutral|OK , what does that entail ?
neutral|It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances .
neutral|Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ?
neutral|Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .
joy|I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?
neutral|Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu .
joy|Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today .
neutral|My aunt told me one of her secrets--cellophane tape .
neutral|I just got it at the special health store . It's for my flabby arms .
neutral|Let me know how it works .
neutral|I have to say , I have had enough of this roller coaster .
neutral|I know what you mean . I'm like a yo-yo .
neutral|Last week I was down to 60 kilos . This week I had one donut more . Now I'm up to 62 kilos .
neutral|May I have a menu , please ?
neutral|Of course .
neutral|Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?
neutral|Lobster ? It is steamed and served with our special sauce .
neutral|Is it good ?
neutral|Sure . It is a most popular dish .
neutral|I think I will try some lobster , and give me some green salad together .
neutral|Can ’ t you come in and have tea now , Peter ?
neutral|Not yet , I must water the garden first .
neutral|Do you have to water it now ?
neutral|I ’ m afraid I must . Look at it ! It ’ s terribly dry .
disgust|What a nuisance !
neutral|Last summer it was very dry , too . Don ’ t you remember ? I had to water it every day .
neutral|Well , I ’ ll have tea by myself . That was quick ! Have you finished already ?
neutral|Yes , Look out of the window .
neutral|It ’ s raining . That means you needn ’ t water the garden .
joy|That was a pleasant surprise . It means I can have tea , instead .
neutral|I'm broke , and I have to catch another bus .
neutral|Why don't you have any money for another bus ?
neutral|I got hungry and bought some chips .
neutral|That was smart .
neutral|Anyway , do you have any change I can use for the bus ?
neutral|I don't have any .
neutral|I don't know how I'm going to get home .
neutral|Get a transfer from the bus driver .

joy|Thanks .
neutral|An idea about killing time on a train ?
neutral|I advise you to read Playboy.You can get a lot from it .
neutral|But there's quite a lot of rumors about it .
joy|That's why it's interesting .
neutral|Have you brought the receipt with you ?
neutral|No , I don't . I left it home .
neutral|Sorry , but we can't do anything without the receipt . Come back with it .
neutral|I didn't know . I'll go to get it . How late will you be open ?
neutral|Till 5:30 .
neutral|I haven't told you what happened yet , have I ?
neutral|I haven't heard anything .

neutral|That's right . It's normal if you don't often take the plane . Just relax a little bit .
neutral|Why this happens to me when I am on the plane ? I feel bad .
neutral|Don't worry , sir . It's just because of the lower pressure .
neutral|What should I do about it ?
neutral|You may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts .
neutral|OK , thanks . Does it work really ? I'll give a try .
neutral|Are you feeling better now ? Do you need some pills ?
neutral|Much better . Thank you . I just feel tired but I can't fall asleep .
neutral|So , you'd better wear this eyeshade and you will sleep well .
neutral|I am not used to wearing that . Thanks .
neutral|If you try to adapt yourself to your destination's local time , you'll feel more comfortable . So please try to sleep , and have meals according to Los Angeles's time .
neutral|Thank you so much .
neutral|Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make .
neutral|Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ?
neutral|Did you have the room checked before we move in ?
neutral|Which room are you in ?

neutral|I would like to open an account please .
neutral|Do you have any form of ID ?
neutral|I have my Tennis Club card . Is that good enough ?
neutral|I ’ m afraid not . It has to be a passport or a valid driver ’ s license .
neutral|Oh ... wait a minute ... here ’ s my driver ’ s license .
neutral|OK , just fill in this application . You can sit over there . This brochure explains our services . We have free checking , and you will be given a debit card and on ATM card . There is no service
neutral|OK , I ’ ll fill out the form and come right back .
neutral|Hello , how can I be of service ?
neutral|Hello . I'm not sure who I need to speak to . I got this 50 yuan note today and it seems a little odd to me .
neutral|The first thing we do is check the feel of the paper ;d oes it feel too thick or too thin ? Then we check the watermark . In my opinion it is counterfeit . I'll just run it through the scanner to double check .
neutral|What happens now ?
neutral|Well , it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . So , unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB . We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
neutral|Dear , can you drive me to the clinic ?
sadness|I'm afraid I can't .
neutral|Why ?
neutral|Well , my car won't start . I don't know what's the matter with it .
neutral|Could it be the battery ?
neutral|No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago.It must be other problems .
neutral|Well , I suppose it could be the gas .
neutral|No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday .
neutral|Perhaps it's the starter then ?
neutral|Yes , that's possible .
neutral|What do you reading , Linda ?
neutral|I'm reading a novel , The mill on the floss , written by the famous novelist gorge alias .
neutral|What's it about ?

neutral|I am not sure , which one is better ?
neutral|The bus is cheaper but also slower . It will take about two-and-a-half hours .
neutral|And how long does the train take ?
neutral|If you take the fast train , it will take about 50 minutes .
neutral|Where do I catch the train ?
neutral|The trains for Cambridge leave from King's Cross Station . They run approximately every half hour . Most trains to Cambridge go from Platform 9 .
neutral|How do I get to King's Cross ?
neutral|The best way is to take an underground tube train directly to King's Cross . The Underground station is just round the corner from here .
neutral|Can you show me on the map ?
neutral|It is very easy . Just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads . The entrance to the Underground station is about 50 meters further on .
joy|Thank you very much .
joy|You're welcome .
neutral|Have you seen the sales report for last quarter ? Who do you think is our digest threat ?
neutral|From the numbers , it seems like Forest Inc . is our digest competitor ... Le'Ban and Markford are also major contenders in our market .
neutral|Le'Ban is the new kid on the block , it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon ... With them on the scene , the competition is outthrough .
neutral|here's information about our competitor's recent market activities ...
neutral|Thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . With competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . We need a price we can compete with .
neutral|We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market .
neutral|Better start swimming ! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys . I want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next Tuesday ... the competition never sleeps and neither should we .

neutral|OK . Let me send a memo around .
neutral|Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back .
neutral|I don ’ t think he ’ s back today .
neutral|Oh , that ’ s right . Go ahead anyways . I ’ ll fill him in . We can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances !
neutral|I know , it ’ s a big one .
neutral|Would you mind if I ask some personal questions ?
neutral|No . I don ’ t . Please .
neutral|Are you in robust health ?
neutral|I have a little problem , I'm overweight for my height . I think I should go on a diet .
neutral|The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid .
neutral|Is there anything wrong ?
neutral|We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard .
surprise|It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ?
neutral|Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally
neutral|Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ’ ll send our technicians to repair them .
neutral|Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee .
neutral|I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee .
neutral|All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you .
neutral|Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday .
neutral|Oh where was that ?
neutral|I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track .
neutral|Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods .
neutral|Well , it pays off for her . How old is she anyway ?
neutral|She will be 86 next month .
joy|That is truly amazing !
neutral|Did you punch in ?
joy|Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable !
surprise|Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it .
neutral|Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ?
neutral|Sure , when those never ending meetings .
neutral|I don't think you've met my sister , Mary .
neutral|No , I haven't had the pleasure .
neutral|Come and meet her now .
neutral|All right .
sadness|Excuse me , would you tell me how to return to Hilton Hotel . I'm afraid I lost my way .
neutral|Did you have hotel card or something ?
neutral|Let me see . Yes , I have the address and hotel telephone number here .
neutral|Oh , you stay at the down town Hilton . When you go down two blocks this way and turn left , you will find it on your right .
neutral|I don't understand very well . Could you give me a map ?
joy|The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?
neutral|I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself .
neutral|So , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ?
neutral|Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced .
neutral|How long did it take you to do the tiling .
neutral|As I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .
joy|I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?
joy|You ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .
neutral|I'd like to see that pen , please .
neutral|You mean this one ?
neutral|No , the other one in the brown case .
neutral|Oh , this one ... Here .
neutral|May I try it ?
neutral|Sure .
neutral|It's very smooth . I'll take it .
neutral|Cash or charge ?
neutral|Charge , please .
neutral|I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles .
neutral|We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days .
neutral|Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price .
neutral|I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .
neutral|I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources .
neutral|But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .
neutral|I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years .
neutral|There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .
neutral|Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose .
neutral|Good morning.sir.My name is Liu Peng from Tsinghai University . I am here for the interview relating to my visa application .
neutral|Glad to meet you.Would you mind if I ask you some questions ?
neutral|Of course not .
neutral|Why do you want to go to the US ?
neutral|I'd like to have further education.Now I am studying for my doctorate .
neutral|Will you get any kind of scholarship ?
neutral|Yes . The school has provided me with full scholarship and that will be enough to support myself .
neutral|Could you say something about your educational background ?
neutral|Yes . I graduated from shanghai University and later obtained a master's degree from Oxford .
neutral|What was your graduation thesis on ?
neutral|My graduation thesis is on International Trade .
neutral|Hello , I'd like to open an account .
neutral|Which account would you like to open ?
neutral|I'd like to open a savings account . What's the interest rate now ?
neutral|It is 3.2 % . You may earn a little interest on money .
neutral|Is there any minimum deposit for the first time ?
neutral|Yes , the opening minimum deposit is 1,000 Yuan .
neutral|What about the later deposits ?
neutral|For the later deposits , you can deposit any you want . Even one Yuan is OK .
neutral|OK , that's good .
neutral|Your ID , please .
neutral|Here you are , a thousand Yuan and my ID .
neutral|Wait a moment , please ... Here is your bankbook . Keep it well please .
neutral|Thanks . I will .
neutral|Hello Mr . Jones , please have a seat . Thank you for coming in today . I have read your resume . You completed University in England ?
neutral|Yes , I went to Cambridge . After graduation , I started right away into the advertising industry . Later , I made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research .
neutral|So , what experience do you have ?
neutral|I have ten years marketing experience . This includes both entry level and management positions . In my last position , I worked my way up to being director of the marking department .
neutral|I can see that from your resume.Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? Later , why did you decide to leave your former post ?
neutral|I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new .
neutral|I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ?
neutral|I would rather work full-time .
neutral|I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ?
neutral|I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year .
neutral|My lease ends next month , so I have to find a new place .
neutral|I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there .
neutral|Do you know any places ?
neutral|Well . I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available .
joy|Thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .
neutral|How much do are you looking to spend ?
neutral|I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month .
neutral|Looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs .
neutral|It doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route .
neutral|Anything you need to have in the place ?
neutral|I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .
neutral|You can also check out university bulletin boards .
neutral|Why ? Will those be students who are leaving ?
neutral|Not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent .
joy|Thank you . I'll be sure to take a look .
joy|Good luck .
neutral|Excuse me , but can I draw on my account for payment of things I buy in China ?
neutral|Certainly , sir . How much do you draw ?

neutral|Yes , sir . Your balance is RIB 34,000 .
neutral|Are you here about your ticket ?
neutral|Yes , I am , Your Honor .
neutral|What is your argument ?
neutral|Your Honor , the police officer pulled me over for speeding .
neutral|You must've been speeding .
neutral|No , Your Honor , I was not .
neutral|Tell me how many miles per hour you were going .
neutral|I was going 35 in a 40 mph zone .
neutral|That's fine , so I'll let you go with a warning .
neutral|So , I don't have to pay the ticket ?
neutral|You won't have to pay the fine .
joy|Thank you very much , Your Honor .
joy|Yes ! I finally lost that last five pounds I've been working on forever !
neutral|How did you finally do it ?
neutral|A friend suggested that I stop nibbling between meals .
neutral|Like snacking ?
neutral|You know , a little piece of chocolate here , some chips on the side , candy now and then ...
neutral|I get what you mean .
neutral|Instead , I sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals .
joy|I'm impressed . Good for you !
neutral|This is our Submission of Tender which includes the information about volume of the project , the cost and so on .
neutral|OK ! We'll see it .
neutral|What kind of guarantee are you going to provide for us ?
neutral|We can provide you with standby letter of credit established by Bank of China .
neutral|Should we pay earnest money ?
neutral|Yes , you are supposed to pay it on time . If you don't furnish a tender bond on time , your tender will not be considered . Besides , you also should provide derailed engineering of the good .
neutral|Where do we submit the tender ?
neutral|To our office which is on the third floor .

neutral|All right . Let me have a check . Can you tell me how can you inspect your exported goods ?
neutral|Our quality control department is in charge of the inspection , which is directly under general manager . It is essential to attach the importance to the quality of goods . It is the basement for the future cooperation .
neutral|That is good . And here I give you a piece of advice . You should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item . Besides , it's better to secure the cartons with metal straps . What's more , the order number wasn't anywhere on some of the boxes .
neutral|I realize that now . I will do that after a while .
neutral|Thank you . Can I open the packages to check the color and style ?
neutral|Of course , let me help you .
joy|The color and style are consistent with the sample . Great !
neutral|You know , we are superior to other clothes companies .
neutral|Yes , that's for sure . There is nothing wrong with the quality . I think you'd better pack them first in plastic bags , than in cartons .
neutral|OK . We will manage it later .
neutral|Daddy , are you going to the park with us this weekend ?
neutral|Honey , I have a lot of work to do .

neutral|What about the Olympic park ?
neutral|Right , ah . It is so close to our home . How come we've never thought of that ?
neutral|The Olympic Park has a small forest . It is fit for picnic .

neutral|What country produces them ?
neutral|They come from tropical countries .
neutral|Please sit down .

neutral|Have you ever had a foreign instructor in English composition ?
neutral|Yes , my college teacher was an Australian . She was also our adviser on our English language newspaper . I was the editor for two years .
neutral|That ’ s very interesting . Tell me what you did exactly .
neutral|Well , I planned the layout of the newspaper and then I assigned various articles and columns to other students to write . I wrote the editorial each time .
neutral|What is your aim in going into the field of journalism ?
neutral|To be frank with you , I would like nothing better than to be an overseas reporter some day .
neutral|That can be a rough job , you know .
neutral|Yes , I know that . But I like adventure and excitement in my writing .

neutral|Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ?
neutral|What do you need ?
neutral|I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him .
neutral|He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
anger|I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable !
neutral|Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .
anger|He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
neutral|I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
anger|I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .
neutral|Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss .
anger|Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
neutral|Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper .
disgust|I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?
neutral|I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions .
neutral|hey , you look great ! how's everything ?
neutral|yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit .
neutral|really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work .
neutral|it's important to do proper exercises .
neutral|you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .
neutral|the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
neutral|sounds reasonable .
neutral|we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
neutral|and fruits !
neutral|surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
neutral|I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
neutral|yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health .
neutral|I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
neutral|you bet it !
anger|Staying out all night , you frightened me to death .
neutral|I stayed with my friends .
anger|You should at least give me a call .
sadness|I'm sorry , Mum .
neutral|Did anyone call ?
neutral|Just Mr . White .
neutral|What did he want ?
neutral|He wouldn't say over the phone .
neutral|What kind of job do you intend to do ?
neutral|I want to do some management job since I have three-year's work history .
neutral|What are your plans if you were hired ?
neutral|I would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company .
neutral|You stepped on my foot !
sadness|Sorry . I didn't mean to .
neutral|what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ?
neutral|while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement .
neutral|why not ?
neutral|the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing !
neutral|it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .
neutral|I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children .
neutral|I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .
neutral|all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .
neutral|perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .
neutral|I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .
neutral|that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad .
neutral|you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking .
neutral|Good morning . Could I speak with Mr . Willard please ?
neutral|This is he . Who ’ s calling , please ?
neutral|This is Chris Emerson speaking .
neutral|Hello , Chris . How can I help you ?
neutral|Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , Miss Thong ?
neutral|Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization .
neutral|Should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ?
neutral|No , not necessary . Usually we have a set form which is printed . We just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company .
neutral|Of course , let me find one for you .
neutral|Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ?
sadness|Sorry , it ’ s all sold out .
neutral|Well , do you have any for tomorrow ?
neutral|We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m .
neutral|Ok . I ’ ll take it .
neutral|Where would you like to sit ?
neutral|Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes .
joy|Certainly .
neutral|Lily , I am terribly sorry about this . But we have to put off or cancel tomorrow's meeting .
surprise|Cancelled ? That's just can't happen !
neutral|Sorry to say , but nothing can be done . The equipment broke down and can't be fixed till Friday .
neutral|Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday .
neutral|Overseas operator , may I help you ?
neutral|Yes . I would like to place a collect call .
neutral|Can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ?
neutral|Terry and his number is 4562325 8 .
neutral|Please wait a moment . It Will take a few seconds to get through .
neutral|Would you help me figure out what to do about the office party ?
neutral|I would be happy to help . What would you like me to help with , food or entertainment ?
neutral|I would like to help you with both .
neutral|That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ?
neutral|A dressy party would be fun !
neutral|That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ?
neutral|We should probably have both .
neutral|Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ?
neutral|Maybe we could do both !
joy|Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details .
neutral|I can't find the price tag .
neutral|It's right here . $ 100 .
neutral|But I heard other stores were having great mark-downs on this item .
neutral|Ours are of really good quality .

neutral|How did your company's fundraiser go ?
neutral|The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research .
neutral|So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ?
neutral|Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars .
neutral|Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society .
neutral|In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause .

neutral|How about your interview ?
sadness|They turned me down .
surprise|Why ? You are so excellent .
sadness|I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to .
sadness|What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them !
neutral|It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies .
neutral|I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet .

neutral|Not at all .

neutral|Do you plan to further your study ?
neutral|Yes , I have been always learning the Economics on my own . My dream is to get a master's degree in Economics .
neutral|If you make every effort to the company , you will have a great chance to attend the on-the-job postgraduate . The tuition fee will be financed by our company .

neutral|What's it look like , lady ? This is the ticket line I'm standing in , isn't it ?
neutral|Well , yes , it is , but ...

anger|You just cut into line , in front of me and everyone else , that's what ! Go take your place back at the end of the line , like every - one else !
anger|Oh sure , lady , and fat chance I'd get a ticket before they're sold out . I'm staying right here , understand ? So be a nice lady and butt out !
anger|Just what gives you the right ... ?
anger|Because I'm no sucker ; only suckers go to the end of the line . It's as simple as that , lady .

neutral|Is there anything I can do for you ?
neutral|I haver run out of gas .
neutral|What kind of oil do you want ?
neutral|Premium , please . By the way , please don't fill it up . Two gallons will be fine .
joy|No problem .
neutral|I'm starving . Let's get something to eat .
neutral|Can we go somewhere nearby ? I don't feel like walking too far .
joy|Sure . What kind of food do you like ?
neutral|I mean the food for something spicy .
neutral|How about some Korean food ? There's a place right there on the corner .
joy|That sounds great . I love Korean food .
neutral|May I help you , madam ?
neutral|Yes . I ’ m trying to find a pair of earrings to match my necklace . Can you recommend some to me ?
neutral|Yes . Your gold necklace has a diamond pendant , and your eardrops should be
neutral|These look wonderful . Do these come with a guarantee of quality ?
neutral|Of course . If there is anything wrong with them , you can come back and show me the guarantee of quality , and then you will surely get free service .
neutral|I ’ ll take them .
neutral|I ’ Ve lost my purse .
surprise|Oh , dear . What was in it ?
neutral|All my money .
neutral|Well . Go to the police station and see if it ’ s there .
neutral|Royal Hotel , can I help you ?
neutral|Yes . I urgently need a room for tomorrow night , and do you have any vacancies ?
neutral|Yes , we have . What kind of room would you like ?
neutral|I'd like a suite with an ocean view , please .
neutral|No problem , sir .
neutral|Come in , please .
neutral|Good morning ! I am Anna Lu . I've come for an interview which was arranged .
neutral|Oh , I see . I am Jack White , Personnel Manager . Take a seat , please .
neutral|Glad to meet you , Mr . White .
neutral|Miss Lu , have you got any experience in restaurant service ?
neutral|Yes . Since I entered college , I have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress .
neutral|For how long ?
neutral|3 years .
neutral|Our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . Can you serve them in English ?
neutral|That's why I applied for this job . Now I am studying Hotel English in my college , and I am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette . I am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers .
neutral|You must know our working hours are very long and overtime work is frequent .
neutral|I don't mind that .
neutral|I think I will give you a 3 months ’ trial . The salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus . After that period if we both feel satisfied , a formal contract would be signed .

joy|Sure . Why don ’ t you try it on ? The fitting room is over there .
joy|It ’ s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ?
neutral|I ’ m thinking about buying this sweater . I know it ’ s June now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
neutral|It looks too big for you , but I like the color and the material is good quality . Is it on sale ?
neutral|Yes , it ’ s half price . It ’ s supposed to be too large--that ’ s the fashion .
neutral|I might get one too , but in a different color . I prefer light blue to white 。
joy|There.It looks great , don ’ t you think ? I ’ m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .
surprise|I ’ m getting this beret ? Doesn ’ t it look cool ? I ’ d like to get some jeans too , but I don ’ t have enough cash on me .
neutral|Don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve got my credit card . You can pay me back later .
joy|Thanks ! Now I don ’ t need to come back to the shop a second time .
neutral|Good morning . Wilson Association .
neutral|This is Mr Brown speaking . I'd like to speak to Mr . Thomas , please .
neutral|I'm sorry , but Mr.Thomas left the office a few minutes ago .
sadness|That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . Will he be back soon ?
neutral|I'm afraid not . He's gone for the rest of the day .
neutral|Is there anywhere I can reach him ?
neutral|I don't believe so . He's going out of town on business . May I take a message ?
neutral|I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it .
neutral|Would you care to make another appointment ?
neutral|Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days .
neutral|I see . I can tell Mr.Thomas that you phoned .
neutral|Thank you .
neutral|Bye-bye .
neutral|I see you have bought the latest copy of “ beauty and fashion ” . Are there any interesting articles in it ?
neutral|There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The “ which ? ” section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . The article recommends “ all clear ” for effectiveness and price .
neutral|I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine .
neutral|Which tests do you mean ?
neutral|You know . Tests like ” how jealous are you ? ” and “ are you a fashion victim ? ”
neutral|Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ’ t take them seriously .
neutral|Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ’ m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy .
neutral|Marry Wang's Office , this is Marry .
neutral|Hi Marry , this is Tom .
neutral|How can I help you ?
neutral|I need to see if we can get together today .
neutral|Put on the helmet , please .
neutral|Do we need to put on the jackets too ?
neutral|You ’ d better , to protect your clothes . Now please watch your step .
neutral|Thank you . Is the production line fully automated ?
neutral|Well , not fully automated .
neutral|I see . How do you control the quality ?
neutral|All products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process .
neutral|What ’ s the monthly output ?
neutral|One thousand units per month now . But we ’ ll be making 1,200 units beginning with October .
neutral|What ’ s your usual percentage of rejects ?
neutral|About 2 % in normal operations .
neutral|That ’ s wonderful . Is that where the finished products come off ?
neutral|Yes . Shall we take a break now ?
neutral|Excuse me . May I take you a picture ?
neutral|With pleasure .
neutral|Thanks you . Shall we stand a bit further ? I would like to take the tower in .

neutral|Yes , I ’ m pretty sure .
neutral|Do you have her address ?

neutral|Bye !
neutral|Good morning , Mr Zhang , I wonder whether you have got an answer from your superior .
neutral|Yes , we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon .
neutral|What's the answer ?
neutral|We decided that we could agree to your price , but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery .
neutral|Let me see . I quoted your delivery in three months , didn't I ?
neutral|Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible .
neutral|I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month .
neutral|Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then .
neutral|By all means .
neutral|Be careful . The floor is wet .
neutral|What happened ?
neutral|I spilled my drink .
neutral|Hello , this is Lucie Jing calling from Lincoln Bank . May I speak to Mr Was , please ?
neutral|Speaking .
neutral|Ah , hello , Mr Was . I'm just calling about your new credit card . It has arrived with us , so you can either come to collect it , or we can send it on to you .
neutral|Sending it won't be necessary . I'm actually coming in for a meeting with my Personal Banker this afternoon .
joy|What perfect timing !
neutral|Indeed . Is there anything I need to do before I collect it ?
neutral|Not really . But we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card , just in case there is something you aren't happy with .
neutral|I'm sure it'll be fine . How about my PIN number ?
neutral|That will be sent on to you within 2 working days . Then , you can start using your new card .
joy|Great . I'll be in later today . Thanks for calling . Bye .
neutral|What are we eating for lunch ?
neutral|I have no idea . What about you ?
neutral|I kind of want pizza .
neutral|I ate pizza the other day .
neutral|So , what do you feel like eating then ?
neutral|How about some burgers ?
neutral|I already had a burger yesterday .
neutral|What are we going to do ?
neutral|We can just each get what we want to get .
joy|That sounds like a plan .
neutral|Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ?
neutral|I think they sell both at the cafeteria .
neutral|Did you bring your certificate for nursing ?
neutral|Yes , here is my Certificate of Nurse .
neutral|How about your nursing education ?
neutral|I learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at Hunan Nursing School .
neutral|Can you manage English conversation ?
neutral|Yes , pretty well . I have started learning English since primary school .
neutral|Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ?
neutral|My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl
neutral|Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ?
neutral|For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share .
neutral|Don't you think you would miss having other people around ?
neutral|No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy
neutral|If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?
neutral|That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like
neutral|Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
neutral|I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children !
neutral|Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses !
neutral|I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
neutral|Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
neutral|So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?
neutral|Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
joy|Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ?
neutral|No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
neutral|You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned .
neutral|Is Tom in ?
neutral|No , he is at work now .
neutral|May I have his office phone number please ?
neutral|Sure . It's 289,1234 .
neutral|What about driving to Shanghai ?
neutral|Driving ? No way , it's too far .
neutral|I just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places . How long will it take ?
neutral|Too long , and you do not have much time .
sadness|What a pity .
neutral|Good afternoon . I'll show you to your room .
neutral|Thank you .
neutral|Could you tell me which bags are yours ?
neutral|They're over there next to the door . Those three with green tags on them .
neutral|Could you wait a moment ? I have to get a trolley . May I see your room key , please ?
neutral|Sure , here it is .
neutral|Thank you . Room 402 . You're on the 4th floor . This way , please .
neutral|Excuse me , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ?
neutral|Yes . I bought the can two days ago , but today I found that is beyond the guarantee period .
sadness|Let me see . I am sorry , sir . We will change another one for you . Please wait a moment .
neutral|Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ?
neutral|The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street .
neutral|How long will it take me to get there ?
neutral|It's about a ten-minute walk .
joy|That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
joy|Not at all .
neutral|Excuse me ! Does this bus go to the railway station ?
neutral|No , You're got on the wrong bus . You can take a No . 22 bus at the University station and then transfer to a No . 83 bus at the railway station .
joy|OK ! Thank you very much !
neutral|I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement .
neutral|Good , if you ’ ll excuse me , I ’ ll go over the sheet right now .
neutral|Take your time .
neutral|I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high .
neutral|I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years .
neutral|We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ?
neutral|Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly .
neutral|The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first .
neutral|Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent .
neutral|When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent .
neutral|How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ?
neutral|To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help .
neutral|Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ?
neutral|I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ?
neutral|Very well , I will .
neutral|Excuse me , you look lost.Can I help you ?
joy|Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station .
neutral|Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right .
neutral|Right ? OK , got it .
neutral|Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ?
neutral|Next left then right ? OK .
neutral|I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said .
neutral|I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? '
neutral|I'm trying to find a post office .
neutral|Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there .
neutral|Should I take the bus ?
neutral|No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk .
joy|Thank you very much .
joy|Anytime .
neutral|It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature .
neutral|Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background .
neutral|Yes .
neutral|But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate .
neutral|So you must be an extravert ?
neutral|Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them .
neutral|What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ?
neutral|A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment .
neutral|Don't you consider it a hard work ?
neutral|Hard but interesting , I think .
neutral|Have you any experience as a tourist guide ?
neutral|Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University .
neutral|Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ?
neutral|Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well .
neutral|Didn ’ t you punch in this morning , Monica ?
neutral|Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching .
neutral|That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule .
neutral|Do we also need to punch out after work ?
neutral|According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day .
neutral|How about the lunch break , Lucy ?
neutral|From 11 thirty to 1 o ’ clock .
neutral|May I ask whether we need to work overtime ?
neutral|Sometimes , but not quite often .
neutral|This needs dry-cleaning.Can you remove this stain without harming the fabric ?
neutral|Let me see . We ’ ll try , but I ’ m not sure that we can remove it .
neutral|Ok , then . We ’ ll I ’ d also like to have this pressed .
neutral|Any starch ?
neutral|No starch .
neutral|What's the problem ?
neutral|I have a laceration on my left forearm .
neutral|Let me have a look . How did this happen ?
neutral|I got hit by a car in an accident .
neutral|Was there much bleeding afterward ?
neutral|No , not much .
neutral|Well , this doesn't look too serious . Nurse , could you please get me a suture set ?
neutral|Will I need stitches ?
neutral|Yes . Three , I think . It wont ' be too painful . Alright , we're done . That wasn't so bad , was it ?
neutral|No , not really .
neutral|You're lucky there was no lasting damage . I'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days . We'll take those stitches out then . So long .
joy|Thank you , doctor . Bye .
neutral|What time is it ?
neutral|Ten to nine .
neutral|Your watch is ten minutes slow . So it's should be nine sharp . I'm gonna be late again . What will be my excuse this time ? It should be set the alarm for seven thirty .
neutral|Don't cry over spilled milk , Fred ? Could you stay with me a few minutes ?
neutral|What ? Why ? What's wrong with you ?
sadness|I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ?
neutral|You will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . I've got to woke now , I'll be late .
sadness|You only care about your work .
neutral|Sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all I do just for our family .
neutral|Stay just a few minutes longer , OK ?
neutral|OK , I'll leave at 9:15 , Is that all right ?
joy|Yes .
neutral|I'll spent more time with you in the future , Dina .
joy|Thank you .
neutral|Canton Hotel .
neutral|I'd like to reserve a double room . I will be arriving next Monday , the 12th . My name is Wilson .
neutral|A double room for the 12th ? The name is Wilson ?
neutral|Yes , that's right .
neutral|How long will you be staying ?
neutral|Three or four days , perhaps longer .
neutral|Very good , sir . We will be expecting you next Monday , the 12th .
neutral|How is the result of your lab test ?
neutral|When it comes to that , I have a lot to say .
neutral|Then say it .
neutral|When I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death . Then you guess what he said .
neutral|That ’ s just what I want to know .
joy|He told me the tests were negative and there was nothing wrong with me .
neutral|Could you tell me something about your family ?
neutral|OK . There are five people in my family , Father , mother , elder brother , younger sister and I .
neutral|Are your brother and sister still in school ?
neutral|My brother has found his job and my sister is still in college .
neutral|What does your father do ?
neutral|My father is a middle school teacher .
neutral|What about your mother ?
neutral|My mother is a housewife .
neutral|Are you married ?
neutral|I am not married yet and I live alone now .
neutral|Do you need to support your family ?
neutral|No , my father and brother are doing that .
neutral|Have you finished school ?
neutral|Yes , I have already graduated .
joy|I'm in heaven ! A Whirlpool dryer !
joy|I love them , too . Let's move into the kitchen . Wait until you see the refrigerator .
joy|This is too good to be true .
joy|And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ?
joy|Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too .
joy|It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ?
joy|We love it . But we'd like to know about the neighbors .
neutral|How's your new car ?
neutral|Perfect ! Couldn't be better .
neutral|You made a good choice , then ?
neutral|It's just what I want .
neutral|No regrets ?
joy|I am really pleased with it .
joy|I am glad you are happy .
joy|It's super .
neutral|Good afternoon , Sir . You're here to see about a Temporary Loan , right ? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . Is that what you require ?
neutral|Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ?
neutral|Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period .
neutral|Is there any flexibility on that ?
neutral|Unfortunately , not .
neutral|OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .
neutral|Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away .
neutral|Mr . Wang , I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai . You can make some changes if it does not suit you .
neutral|All right . Please read it to me .
neutral|On Friday morning , Mr . Wang , the director of Shanghai Research Institute , will visit you at the hotel . In the afternoon , you will discuss some problems with Mr . Yang , vice manager of computer corporation .
neutral|Very good .
neutral|On Saturday , you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing . Miss Lu will be your guide .
joy|Oh , that's great .
neutral|Hi , I would like to return this TV .
neutral|Sure , do you have the receipt ?
neutral|Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard .
neutral|Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ?
neutral|The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .
neutral|I see , and what about the keyboard ?
neutral|I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .
sadness|I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .
anger|Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways .
neutral|There are so many people that the tickets are all sold out !
neutral|Luckily we got the last two .
surprise|Look , Danny . The Four Great Inventions !
neutral|Gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing .
neutral|I really admire those who made such great inventions !
neutral|May , I don't see why they are great . They are just simple things .
neutral|They look simple today . But they were milestones in their times .
surprise|Milestones ? May , you must be kidding .
neutral|Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system .
neutral|Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them .
neutral|No , quite the contrary .
neutral|Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ?
neutral|Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection .
neutral|Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates .
neutral|What can I do for you ?
neutral|I need some medicine .
neutral|For whom ?
neutral|My wife . She suffers from a bad cold .
neutral|What symptoms does she have ?
neutral|Fever and a bad cough .
neutral|I see . Don't worry , just a common cold .
neutral|What kind of medicine does she need ?
neutral|Patulin will be enough .
neutral|How many pills for each time ?
neutral|Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal .
neutral|Thank you very much .
neutral|It's my pleasure .
neutral|Do you believe in god ?
neutral|Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . do you ?
neutral|I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ?
neutral|I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one .
neutral|I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet .
neutral|I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .
neutral|For example ?
neutral|Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .
neutral|Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .
neutral|Didn't you say your friend was American ? Where is she going on her honeymoon ?
neutral|They're going skiing in Colorado .
joy|What a coincidence ! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon !
joy|You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said .
anger|What a terrible house !
neutral|I'm sick of it , too .
anger|The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart .
neutral|It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out .
neutral|Sure .
neutral|Hello !
neutral|Is that Sue ?
neutral|Speaking .
neutral|A.This is George .
neutral|Hello , George.What ' s up ?
joy|This website offers very convenient air tickets booking service . It is quick and accurate .
neutral|Yes , I once booked there . They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail . You can conveniently pay by credit card , so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes . They also provide e-tickets , meaning you don ’ t need to go to any office to pick an air ticket . You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card .
neutral|So it has attracted more and more customers these days .
neutral|Yes , therefore they are expanding the scope of their service . For example , hotels can be booked through the same site as well .
neutral|Excuse me .
neutral|Hello sir , may I help you ?
neutral|Yes . Can I see that T-shirt on the top shelf please ?
neutral|Sure . Here it is .
neutral|How much does it cost ?
neutral|50 dollars .
surprise|50 dollars . That's too much .
neutral|How about this one ? It's on sale for only 35 dollars .
neutral|I don't like that one .
neutral|How about the one next to the black gloves ? It's very similar to the one you like .
neutral|That's nice . How much is it ?
neutral|30 dollars .
neutral|That'll be fine .
neutral|Is this color OK , or would you like a different color ?
neutral|That blue one's fine .
neutral|Do you need any more of these shirts ?
neutral|Yes .
neutral|How many do you want ?
neutral|I'll take two more , a red one and a white one .
neutral|Hello , this is Li Bo speaking .
neutral|Hi , I am Liu Ming . I am calling to tell you that I have got the job .
joy|Oh , that is wonderful . Congratulations !
joy|I really feel grateful to you for your reference . They have mentioned this in the job interview .
joy|Don't mention it . I think that is because you have right qualifications and nice personality .
joy|Thanks again . I will start on next Monday . I am sure I will have good performance .
neutral|I agree .
neutral|I am a student in Cambridge University . I read your ad , I want to know something more about your room , please ?
neutral|It's a big bedroom with a drawing room , facing a beautiful wood .
neutral|Is there a bathroom ?
neutral|No , but there is one downstairs , which my daughter used some years ago .
joy|It sounds good . Could I go and see it myself ?
neutral|Certainly , you're welcome anytime .
neutral|See you later !
neutral|( after a while ) Good afternoon , Mrs . Smith . I called you just now .
joy|Welcome ! Come in , please !
neutral|Yes .
neutral|This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is .
joy|Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice !
neutral|Yes , if you want to wash something , there is a separate lavatory room outside .
joy|Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ?
neutral|Anytime you like .
joy|OK .
neutral|Hello , this is Dunlin . May I speak to Mrs Smith ?
neutral|This is Mrs Smith . Can I help you ?
joy|I am calling to say thank you for the interview yesterday .
joy|You are welcome . I am very impressed by your capability .
neutral|Is there anything I should do ?
neutral|No , nothing . It's thoughtful of you to call me again .
neutral|Thank you . Please call me at any time if you have any questions .
neutral|Ok , I will . Do you have any question ?
neutral|No , thank you . Goodbye .
neutral|Goodbye .
neutral|Hi there . Welcome to Lincoln Corporate Services . How can we help ?
neutral|Hi . I was wondering what kind of fixed asset loans you have ? Do you have Fixed Asset Loans ?
neutral|Yes , we do . You'll go through the acceptance application , then a first review , then an evaluation and examination and finally get approval . Why don't you read through this brochure ? It outlines all of the important aspects of the loan , the terms and conditions , etc .
neutral|That's a good idea , to familiarise myself with it . Then , I'll be back if we decide to go ahead .
neutral|There are many art craft items in this shop . I suggest you take your time , and you might find something you like .
neutral|That's what I am going to do .
neutral|If you have any problem , please come to me .
neutral|I surely will . How much is this wood carving ?
neutral|You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell .
neutral|That's OK . Is anything else recommended ?
neutral|Do you have any special request ?
neutral|I'd like to see some traditional arts .
neutral|So that means you are shopping for presents ?
neutral|Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends .
neutral|Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle .
joy|Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .
neutral|I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .
neutral|You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .
neutral|As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country .
joy|Wow , you are the expert on it .
neutral|Operator . Can I help you ?
neutral|I'd like to make a person-to-person call to Beijing , China . The number is 2135367 8 , and I want to speak to Mr . Zhang .
neutral|To Mr . Zhang in at 2135-3678 ?
neutral|Yes , that's right .
neutral|May I have your name and telephone number ?
neutral|My name is Luo Gang , and the phone number is 513-3284 .
neutral|Mr . Luo , will you hold the line , please - - - Mr . Luo , there is no Zhang at that number . Will you check the number again , please ?
neutral|What the number I gave you , operator ?
neutral|It's 2135-3678 .
sadness|Oh , I'm sorry . should have been 2135-3668 , not 3678 . I've given you a wrong number .
neutral|Are you sure this time ?
neutral|Yes .
neutral|OK . Let me try again .
joy|Thank you .
neutral|Are there any special requirements on the project ? And shall we talk around it in details ?
neutral|Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness .
neutral|That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need .
neutral|And please let white color dominate .
neutral|OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ?
neutral|Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city .
neutral|I'll tell them .
neutral|Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor .
neutral|Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery .
joy|Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you .
joy|I think so . Bye !
joy|Bye !
neutral|Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days .
neutral|That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ?
neutral|Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off .
neutral|That's long leave . How's your project coming along ?
neutral|The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on .
neutral|Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave .
neutral|Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients .
neutral|Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed .
neutral|I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black .
neutral|Did you ever get a parking ticket ?
neutral|Only a few .
neutral|What's a few ?
neutral|I've gotten six , I think .
neutral|Did you pay your fines ?
neutral|Of course I have .
neutral|How much are the parking tickets ?
neutral|I think they're $ 130 .
neutral|That's expensive .
neutral|I just got a parking ticket .
neutral|You should probably pay the fine soon .
neutral|I'm going to pay it today .
neutral|Are you doing anything right now , Diana ?
neutral|I am typing a report for the moment , Mr . Robbins . Anything I need to do ?
neutral|Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ?
neutral|Is it urgent ?
neutral|Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract .
neutral|Ok , I am coming .
neutral|Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ?
neutral|Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ?
neutral|No , I ’ d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter .
neutral|All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments .
neutral|Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it .
neutral|Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ?
neutral|Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list .
neutral|You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ?
neutral|Right . And the last thing , we are going to clean the files out tomorrow . Now let's begin .
joy|You're finally here ! What took so long ?
neutral|I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection .
neutral|It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
neutral|I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest .
neutral|perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .
neutral|I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good .
neutral|It would be better for the environment , too .
neutral|I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city .
neutral|Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .
neutral|The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car .
neutral|Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .
joy|That's true . I could certainly use the exercise !
neutral|So , are you going to quit driving to work then ?
neutral|Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment .
neutral|That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though .
neutral|I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand .
neutral|That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out .
neutral|Sure , for at least three thousand per month .
neutral|That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for .
joy|I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .
neutral|Hello . I sent out my laundry yesterday.Aren ' t they ready ?
neutral|They'll be ready by this afternoon .
surprise|Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning .
sadness|Is that right ? We're very sorry .
neutral|I thought it was " the same day " service.Anyway , please do hurry .
sadness|I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .
neutral|Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ?
neutral|Yes , we'll do so .
neutral|Hello , welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ?
neutral|I want to effect payment under an L / C today .
neutral|No problem . OK ... just checking for you . Ah , I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction . What you can do is buy some US dollars , using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount .
neutral|That seems alright . What's the exchange rate like today ? Good or bad ?
neutral|It's not too bad today , actually . 828.23 .
neutral|How can I help you , sir ?
neutral|I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue .
neutral|Sorry , could you tell me your name ?
neutral|I am James Pond from FAM Company and I am here to discuss it with Nova .
neutral|Do you have an appointment ?
neutral|Yes , I did it yesterday . Our meeting should be 2 pm .
neutral|I guess she forgot your meeting . She is attending an important meeting in the company . Will you have a seat ? May I leave a memo for her ?
neutral|Thank you .
neutral|She will be back soon .
neutral|Excuse me . Would you please make a suit with this material ?
neutral|Sure . May I take your measurements ?
neutral|Please don't make it too tight . This is for autumn wear , so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath .
neutral|I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ?
neutral|The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ?
neutral|Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ?
joy|That's fine , thank you .
neutral|Good morning everyone . Thank you for attending the meeting today . I'm sure you all have a copy of the agenda . So let's get started with the first issue .
neutral|We're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior .
neutral|I would like to begin by introducing our foreign guests to our stuff on your left ( right ) , we have Mr . Brown , who is Vice President of Sales . Next to him is Ms . Arts , Director of Marketing for the Atlas Company . In the back row is Dr . Barolo , who is visiting from Italy . Thank you all for coming .
neutral|I am glad to see everyone is here and on time . Let's get started ! Susan , toss out some of your ideas .
neutral|It seems that many boys are fighting there .
anger|Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus .
anger|the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again !
neutral|exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .
anger|on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
neutral|as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .
neutral|I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse
neutral|what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
neutral|it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
neutral|I see , so it's similar to global warming ?
neutral|they're related to one another , yes .
neutral|I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .
neutral|people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .
neutral|people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .
neutral|I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place .
neutral|Would you like some cookies ? I just made them .
joy|Thank you . Yes , I would .
neutral|These are chocolate , and those are almond-flavored .
neutral|I guess I'll try a chocolate one first.Mmmm ... this is delicious.Are they hard to make ?
neutral|No , they're really quite easy . Wait a minute , I've got the recipe right here.See ... these are the ingredients , and then you just follow the directions .
joy|That does look easy . I think I'll make some tonight .
neutral|Can I help you ?
neutral|I'd like to buy a ticket to Casablanca on flight US125 tomorrow .
neutral|Hold on , plese.It will take off at 14:00 tomorrow.The price is $ 110 .
neutral|Well , I want to stay under $ 100 .
neutral|I am sorry Sir . We won't give any discount in busy seasons.The price is the same .
neutral|How do you use an ATM card , Billy ?
neutral|It ’ s easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers .
neutral|Oh yes . I ’ Ve got it written down here . Just a minute .
neutral|You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like .
neutral|Ok , I ’ Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don ’ t I ?
neutral|Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want .
neutral|I can just enter the amount using the key , right ?
neutral|That ’ s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money .
joy|These machines aren ’ t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk .
neutral|Hello , is Jennifer in ?
sadness|I am sorry , you have the wrong number .
sadness|Oh , I am really sorry .
neutral|Can you give me a hand with the dishes ?
neutral|Sure . Should I wash or dry ?
neutral|I wash and you'll dry .
neutral|OK . Let's do it .
neutral|Excuse me , do you have the latest issue of Newsworld ?
neutral|Yes , this week's issue just came in . Here it is .
neutral|How about Music Madness ?
neutral|Let me check ... yes , we got the October issue a few days ago . It's on that shelf over there .
neutral|Okay , I'll take these two magazines and a copy of Today's Post .
neutral|Good afternoon , Miss . What can I do for you ?
neutral|Could you tell me my account balance ? My account number is ...
neutral|Just a moment , please . Your name ?
neutral|Emily Smith .
neutral|Here is your balance .
neutral|Thank you . I want to make a withdrawal of 150 dollars .
neutral|Here you go , Miss .
neutral|Thank you .
neutral|We will go to Luoyang for a vacation next month .
neutral|How long will you stay there ?
neutral|About one week .
neutral|Where will you live during the vacation .
neutral|In the hotel .
neutral|Have you made a reservation ?
neutral|Yes , we have .
neutral|That's OK .
neutral|You look great ! How do you stay in such good shape ?
neutral|Well , I go jogging every morning , eat a healthful diet and work out in a gymnasium twice a week .
neutral|Wow , it sounds like a lot of work . I guess I'm too lazy to do all that .
neutral|Bob from accounting is on the line . Do you want to speak with him ?
neutral|Yes , I need to talk to him .
neutral|I'll put the call through then .
neutral|Thank you .
neutral|I want to send some money to Australia . Could you handle it for me ?
neutral|Yes , madam , how much would you like to remit ?
neutral|2,000 AD $ .
neutral|Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ?
neutral|What is the difference between them ?
neutral|The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one .
neutral|Well , I think the cable is better .
neutral|OK , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone .
neutral|All right . Here you are .
neutral|Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan .
joy|Here you are . Thanks a lot .
neutral|Kate , can we change the channel ?
neutral|Why ?
neutral|This channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good TV programs .
neutral|OK . You can change it .
neutral|What about this one ? Do you like this program ?
neutral|No , I think it is very boring . Can you change it to Channel Twelve , please ?
neutral|Yes . Oh , it's a talk show .
neutral|Yeah , it's very funny . Have you ever watched it before ?
neutral|No , I haven't . This is my first time to watch it .
neutral|I'm sure you will like it .
neutral|Excuse me , is there any summer resort around the town ?
neutral|As far as I know , the nearest one is next to the Willdon .
neutral|It doesn't matter . I just want to have a relax and I don't care how far it is . Can you tell me how to get there ?
neutral|Yes , take the greyhound bus . It will lead you directly there .
joy|Thanks a billion .
neutral|Every honored guests , welcome to Hang Thou . Now we are visiting Tiger-running Spring .
neutral|How can we relate tiger to this spot , Miss Zhang ?
neutral|Its name originates from a legend that two tigers run here and made a hole , and then a spring gushed out from it .
neutral|How ignorant I am !
neutral|The Longing Tea and the Tiger-running Spring water are always considered as the “ Two Wonders in West Lake . ”
neutral|I know that tea . It smells fragrant .
neutral|That's right . All my guests , attention please . We will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos . And next spot will be the Moon Reflected in Three Pools .
joy|Janice , David , come here . We take some photos here . I can't imagine how beautiful it is !
neutral|Can I give you a hand ?
joy|Thanks .
neutral|You have been staying at home for several days . Would you like to hang out with me ?
neutral|No problem . Wait a moment .
neutral|May I speak to Mr . Baker ?
neutral|I ’ m afraid he's not in .
neutral|Will you ask him to call me collect when he ’ s back ?
neutral|Certainly . May I ask who ’ s calling , please ?
neutral|Yes , this is Cindy Wang of A & B Trading Company in New York .
neutral|I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title .
neutral|I'm not sure I can't agree , dan
neutral|Why not ?
neutral|Surely , there are other ways to save money .
surprise|What are you talking about , we tried everything !
joy|I've got some great news for you !
neutral|Did you get the position you wanted ?
joy|Yes , I'll be promoted to department manager .
joy|I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations !

neutral|that doesn't sound pretty .
neutral|do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
neutral|well , I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends .
neutral|you might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery .
neutral|I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
neutral|I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
neutral|if you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
joy|if that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
joy|that sounds like fun .
neutral|hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle !
neutral|English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought .

neutral|Yes , several times .
neutral|How do you like them ?
neutral|Not bad .
neutral|I always have the temptation to eat something there .
neutral|Then , why didn't you do that ?
neutral|I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ?
neutral|Some of them , I think , are not good .
neutral|It doesn't taste good ?
neutral|No , I mean some of them are not clean enough .
neutral|That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ?
neutral|I judge by appearances .
neutral|I got it . I think it's worth trying .
neutral|It certainly is .
neutral|I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things .
neutral|Don't try everything at one time , please .
joy|I see . Thank you .
neutral|I need my minibar restocked .
neutral|Everything is gone , sir ?

neutral|Not a problem . Anything else ?
neutral|Oh , yes , one more thing
neutral|Someone will be up shortly with your order , sir .
neutral|I will travel to Southeast Asia this summer , so I need to exchange some US dollars . Can I get the foreign currency at any bank ?
neutral|I don't think you can . In China , our currency is not freely convertible yet .
neutral|Do you mean there is no way to get any foreign money ?
neutral|No . You can go to the Bank of China to exchange some US dollars at the current exchange rate of the day you exchange them . The maximum amount you can exchange is $ 2,000 .
surprise|Only $ 2,000 ? Are there any other ways to get the money exchanged ?
neutral|The only official way is to go to Bank of China .
neutral|I'd better take more dollars with me . It seems that I need to borrow some from my friends .
neutral|can you squeeze me in sometime today ?
neutral|That ’ s a big order , Jane . I am really swamped .
neutral|I know what you ’ re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy .
neutral|Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ’ t take more than a half hour , will it ?
neutral|You seem to be upset . What ’ s eating you ?
anger|It ’ s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves
neutral|Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb .
anger|Yes , he used to be . But now he ’ s drifting off track .
neutral|He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ’ t be off the beans .
neutral|Bring me some toast , please .
neutral|Would you like butter or jam on your toast or do you just want it plain ?
neutral|Spread some jam , please .
neutral|Anything to drink ?
neutral|Black coffee is fine .
neutral|Peter , it's time to get up .
neutral|Ten more minutes , mom .

neutral|Well , it's illegal to bring food and drinks into the theater .
neutral|Too bad . I did anyway .
neutral|No wonder you brought such a big bag today .
neutral|I brought Strawberry Sticks . See ?
surprise|Those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating !
neutral|Yep . And there's real strawberry chunks in the coating .
joy|I think that you look very cute today .
joy|Is that right ? This is a brand new outfit .
neutral|What store did you get it from ?
neutral|I went to Macy's and picked it out .
joy|I love your outfit right now .
joy|Well , I think you look nice today too .
joy|Thanks . I found these new shoes earlier at the store .
neutral|I think that those are some really nice shoes . What kind are they ?
neutral|These are Chucks .
neutral|Your shoes look really nice . How much did you get them for ?
neutral|They only cost me about forty dollars .
neutral|I'm going to go get a pair for myself .
neutral|What can I do for you ?
neutral|I'd like to be waken up tomorrow morning .
neutral|OK sir . At what time ?
neutral|Well , how long is it from here to the train station ?
neutral|If you take a taxi , it will be 20 minutes .
neutral|Then please wake me up at 7 : OO.Thank you .
neutral|Ah , ah , ah ...
neutral|All right , Bill.Here ' s your daily exercise schedule . You are to jog before breakfast .
neutral|Jog ?
neutral|Then , you are to walk to work .
neutral|Walk ?
neutral|Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time .
neutral|Oh no .
neutral|Use the stairs , never the elevator .
neutral|Oh , dear .
neutral|And three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball .
neutral|Oh no .
neutral|OK , you can stop now.It ' s time for the dance class .
surprise|Dance class ! I don't know how .
neutral|You will .
neutral|Oh ...
neutral|I have a reservation . My name is John Sandals .
neutral|May I see your ID , please , Mr . Sandals ?
neutral|Certainly . Here it is .
neutral|Thank you . Do you have a credit card , Mr . Sandals ?
neutral|Yes , I do . Do you accept American Express ?

neutral|Okay . Here's my VISA card .
neutral|Okay . You're in room 507 . It's a single queen-size bed , spacious , and nonsmoking . Is that suitable ?
neutral|Yes , it sounds like everything I expected .
neutral|Here's your key , sir . If you need anything , just dial 0 on your room phone .
neutral|Sandy , can you help me contact these people ?
neutral|Sure , what do you want me to tell them ?
neutral|Well , I need to confirm the time of their classes .
neutral|Ok , where can I find their telephone number ?
neutral|They are all listed here on this sheet of paper .
neutral|Is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ?
neutral|Unless it ’ s marked differently , it ’ s their home numbers .
neutral|Alright . What if I can ’ t get a hold of them by phone ?
neutral|Then , you should e-mail them with the information .
neutral|Where can I find their e-mail addresses ?
neutral|They should have then listed on their resumes .
neutral|And if there aren ’ t any e-mail addresses ?
neutral|Then send them a SMS on their cell phone .
neutral|Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ?
neutral|Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ’ t pick up .
neutral|Did you leave a voice message ?
neutral|I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list .
neutral|I see . What did you tell her ?
neutral|I told her that she should call me back at my office number .
neutral|Ok , so , maybe I should call her again .
neutral|Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time .
neutral|One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ?
neutral|Sure . You can use this one . The pin number is written on the back of the card .

neutral|Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .
neutral|It ’ s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ?
neutral|Yes , at the end of the hall .
neutral|We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts .
sadness|I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait .
neutral|Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ?
joy|Why not ? I'd love to do that .
neutral|Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art .
joy|Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?
neutral|Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ?
neutral|I surely do . They must have had advanced machine in ancient China to do that .
neutral|No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .
surprise|Unbelievable ! I could never do that .
neutral|Good morning . Can I see Mr Jackson , please ?
neutral|Well . Have you got his permission ?
neutral|Yes . We have an appointment at eight o ’ clock .
neutral|What ’ s your name , please ?
neutral|Robert . Philips Robert .
neutral|The environment varies greatly because of difference in language , customs and traditions .
neutral|Yes . This gap can be filled by export market research before exporting .
neutral|But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers .
neutral|That's right . They do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury .
neutral|Therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount .
joy|Exactly !
neutral|Hello , I really appreciate the opportunity to interview for this position .
neutral|I was wondering if you like team projects , or projects that you work on alone .
neutral|I like to work on group projects that value and need each individual ’ s contributions .

neutral|OK , well , that ’ s all I need to know for now . If something comes up , we ’ ll be contacting you .
neutral|Hello , could I speak to Allison , please ?
neutral|I'm sorry , he's out at the moment .
neutral|When do you expect him back ?
neutral|I think he'll be back in about an hour at least .
neutral|Well , may I leave a message ?
neutral|Yes , of course .
neutral|Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ?
neutral|Ok . Does he know your number ?
neutral|I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .
neutral|13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .

joy|Don't worry . I will try to get a taxi for you . You can take it to the bus station .
joy|I am very grateful to your help .
joy|Don't mention it . It is my duty .
joy|Thanks again .
neutral|Looks like dinner's ready .
neutral|Just about .
neutral|I'm done . Can I watch TV ?
neutral|Here's some water . Take these multi-vitamins and Tylenol .
anger|Uh ! I can't swallow them , Mom !
neutral|Your throat must be swollen .
neutral|Do I have to take them ?
neutral|Here , I'll break them up , so they're smaller . And here's some cough syrup .
anger|Yuck !
neutral|I know , it tastes horrible . But it'll make you feel better . Try holding your nose . It won't taste as bad .
neutral|Hello , Mary .
joy|Oh , hello , Tom ! Beautiful day , isn ’ t it ?
joy|Yes , it is !
neutral|Excuse me , is this the Auto Consumer Loan Center ?
neutral|Yes . Is there anything I can do for you ?
neutral|Could you tell me something about the terms and interest rates for personal automobile consumer loan ?
neutral|The deadline is normally no more than 5 years with the interest adopted according to the corresponding lending rates announced by the PBC .
neutral|I plan to take the loan for 3 years .
neutral|Well , the yearly interest rate is 5.49 % for 3 years . I'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan .
neutral|What about the loan repayment ?
neutral|You may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank , for example , payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments .
neutral|Does that mean I should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest ?
neutral|Exactly . You are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank .
joy|That's very thoughtful of you . Thank you so much .
joy|You're welcome .
neutral|You really need to look at some of the problems we are having with the apartment .
neutral|That apartment never had any problems before . Are you sure the problem isn ’ t you ?
neutral|We spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix .
neutral|Where do you think you have problems ?
neutral|There is no hot water , the bedroom has a broken window , and there are rats in the kitchen .
neutral|You know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before .
neutral|You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment .
neutral|I will fix these problems when I get around to it .
neutral|I will be withholding my rent check this Friday unless these problems are addressed immediately .
anger|You can ’ t do that ! It ’ s illegal !
surprise|I can ’ t believe these skirts are so cheap .
neutral|I know and they are really nice , too .
neutral|I ’ ll have to get a couple in different colors .
neutral|Me , too .
neutral|Buy them now though , or they might not still be here tomorrow .
joy|Good idea , especially at this price .
neutral|Taxi !
neutral|Yes , sir . Where to ?
neutral|Wangfujing , please !
neutral|All right .
neutral|Oh , I like the music on your radio . It's nice .
joy|Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ?
neutral|I like Winner's English very mush . You know the Beijing Olympic Games is right around the corner . We should learn English Well . It's on FM 96.6 , China Business Radio . You can get it on your radio too .
neutral|But I don't speak English at all .
neutral|That's OK . The program is especially for the beginners like us .
neutral|Really ? When is it on ?
neutral|It begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes .
joy|Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that .
neutral|The radio has brought us lots of convenience .
neutral|Yes , I can also learn about the traffic condition through it .
neutral|With the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere .
neutral|So we should take the advantage of it .
neutral|I ’ m thinking about getting a pet , but I ’ m really not sure which animal would be suitable . Could you give me some advice ?
neutral|Certainly ! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . Dogs are very demanding . You need to take them for walks and they love to play . Cats , on the other hand , are more independent .
neutral|I ’ m fairly busy , so I really need an animal that I don ’ t need to care of very much . Actually , I ’ d like a pet that ’ s a little unusual . I don't ’ really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . Do you have any suggestions ?
neutral|Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . Is that a problem ?
neutral|Not really . By the way , I don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake .
neutral|We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after .
joy|That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ?
neutral|Sure . Come over here . As you can see , I have a wide selection of species . They can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . Do you have a favourite colour ?
neutral|I like the red one . What do they eat ?
neutral|You can feed them on various things . They will eat small pieces of meat , but I ’ d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here .
joy|Thanks a lot . What I ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week .
neutral|That ’ s fine . You shouldn ’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet .
neutral|I'd like to make sure my plane reservation is in order .
neutral|May I have your flight number , please ?
neutral|World Airlines , Flight 201 .
neutral|And your name , please ?
neutral|John Anderson .
neutral|Yes , sir . You're booked on Flight 201 , leaving in one hour .
neutral|Thank you .
neutral|I really think if I can get my foot in the door at this company it will do wonders for my career . Do you think you can help me polish my interview style ?
neutral|Sure . Doing your homework and preparing for an interview really pays off .
neutral|I ’ Ve researched the company and think I ’ m perfect for the job but I ’ m not sure how to get it across to them .
neutral|Well first you have to have more confidence.Employers look for people who are interested , enthusiastic and sure of themselves .
neutral|I know I have what it takes but Im worried that my work experience won ’ t sufficient . Should I inflate my experience ?
neutral|No , you should always be upfront and honest about your weaknesses . However by focusing on your strong points and maintaining a positive attitude about your abilities , you can take the attention
neutral|After I am accepted for unemployment benefits , what will happen next ?
neutral|You will receive a Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award letter .

neutral|You will need to fill out a Continued Claim Form every two weeks .
neutral|What information will I need to provide on that form ?
neutral|They will need to know where you worked and how much money you made .
neutral|Are there any other questions on the form ?
neutral|Basically , they want to know that you were available for work and not sick .
neutral|Hello , I was wondering if I could talk with the apartment manager .

neutral|I ’ m sure you can find your favorite there .
joy|Thank you very much .
joy|It ’ s my honor .
neutral|I'm ready to place an order with you , but only one condition that the goods are confined to Australia . Can you do that ?

neutral|May I see the manager of your company ?
neutral|I am.What can I do for you ?
neutral|Form your company's advertisement in the TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY , I learn that you are a foreign trade company of good service . I am interested in it.Here is my resume , ma'am .
neutral|Very good , you majored in International Trade ?
neutral|Yes , I will graduate from the People's University of China this July majoring in International Trade.Besides , at school , I am a top student.Moreover , both my spoken and written English are pretty good .

neutral|I think I ' m qualified for the job if I can be given the chance.While at school , I once worked as part-time translator in a company and salesperson with a textile company for two years.And I don't mind being paid less from the start , I just want to enrich my experience and competence .

neutral|It's a bit too large . Would you please shorten the sleeves ?
neutral|OK , no problem . Let me take your measurement .
neutral|Besides , can you take up the hem one inch ?
neutral|Fine .
neutral|We need a person who knows how to operate and repair all kinds of office appliances .
neutral|I used to hold a similar job for six years .
neutral|So you're quite confident in your experience and skill
neutral|I think so .
neutral|Yes , sir.May I help you ?
neutral|Please I'd like a ticket to New York .
neutral|For today ?
neutral|No , early saturday morning .

neutral|Well . We only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable L \\ C , payable against shipping documents .
neutral|I see . Payment by LC is the safest method , but could you make an exception and accept DA or DP ?

neutral|What about the cost of delivery ?
neutral|We would like to do it in accordance with an F . O . B .
neutral|What may I help you with ?
anger|I need to file a complaint .
neutral|What is your complaint about ?
anger|I got robbed .
neutral|When did this happen ?

neutral|What was taken ?
neutral|My wallet and cell phone .
neutral|Did you get a good look at the person who robbed you ?
neutral|I sure did .
neutral|Would you able to pick him out of a line-up ?
neutral|That shouldn't be a problem .
neutral|Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money .
joy|Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ?
neutral|Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .
neutral|I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate .
neutral|But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .
neutral|Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .
anger|Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .
neutral|Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ?
neutral|Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff .
neutral|I see . And how about the working hours ?
neutral|Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times .
neutral|Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me .
neutral|Good , as long as you understand that .
neutral|And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ?
joy|Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month .
joy|That sounds ideal .
joy|Smells good ! What ’ s for breakfast ?
joy|Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !
joy|Nice ! Brunch !
joy|Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
joy|Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?
joy|Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
joy|Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
joy|Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup !
joy|Come on , fellows . Let's enjoy my wife's cooking !
joy|Em , it's delicious !
joy|Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much .
joy|You're lucky .

neutral|What do you hope to become ?
neutral|I want to prove my true value in the electronic industry , and hopefully in the near future I would be promoted to a higher position .

neutral|Linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ?
neutral|No , don't try to tempt me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slim down .
neutral|You are not really chubby . You are actually thin enough .
neutral|I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter .
neutral|So you are watching your weight , aren't you ?
neutral|Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on a diet .
neutral|How about your grades of study ?
neutral|I had been doing quite well . In all subjects , I got excellent scores .

neutral|All right , sir . They should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon .
joy|Thank you very much .
joy|It's our pleasure .
neutral|Hi , Doris . I hear you are going to the United States next week .

joy|Not at all . She's a joy to have in my class .
neutral|Is she really ?
joy|She is absolutely wonderful .
neutral|So she isn't causing you any problems ?
joy|No . She is actually very intelligent and well behaved .
joy|I'm glad to know that you like her .
joy|You have nothing to worry about with her .
neutral|Good afternoon , ladies . May I help you ?
neutral|Can we have two adjoining double rooms , sir ?
neutral|Have you made a reservation , ladies ?
neutral|I'm afraid not .
neutral|One moment , please . I have to check if there are rooms available . I'm sorry , ladies . We have only two double rooms available but they are on different floors . Would you mind that ?
neutral|We prefer on the same floor because we will probably chat late at night .

neutral|When you made your appointment , what day did you choose ?
neutral|My appointment was on Wednesday .
neutral|At what time was that appointment ?
neutral|It was for 4
neutral|I can see the appointment that you had . What day do you need to change to ?
neutral|I want to change to next Tuesday .
neutral|What time would you prefer ?
neutral|I would prefer three o ’ clock in the afternoon .
neutral|I will put you down for that time . Thank you for calling to reschedule .
neutral|Can I help you ?
neutral|En , I am looking for a porter , do you know where I can find one ?
neutral|There are so many here.The men with red hats are the porters .
neutral|What's the charge ?
neutral|Well , it depends how many pieces of luggages you have .
joy|Thank you .
neutral|Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ?
neutral|Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers .
neutral|Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ?
neutral|Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion .
neutral|I didn ’ t pay attention to that .
neutral|Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ?
neutral|It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster , but much more expensive .
neutral|We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams .
neutral|Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around .
neutral|That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus .
surprise|Really ? I think you see more traveling by train .
neutral|So which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
neutral|I prefer going by train , even though it costs more .
neutral|Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ?
neutral|The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles .
neutral|We should take a packed lunch on the journey.The food they sell on the trains is always expensive .
neutral|Did you hear about Lulu ?
neutral|No , what ?
neutral|She and Vic broke up and now she ’ s asked for a transfer .
surprise|Get out of here ! I didn ’ t even know they were dating !
neutral|No one really did . They were very discreet and professional at the office .
neutral|Here's a model of our latest design . What do you think of it ?
neutral|Well , I'm not too happy about it .
neutral|What's wrong with it ?
neutral|Well , I'm afraid it's not at all what I wanted . You haven't really followed my instructions.It ' ll have to be done again .
surprise|Oh , dear !
neutral|Hello , this is the International Youth Hotel . How can I help you ?
neutral|oh , yes . I want to check whether you still have any vacancies . I need three single rooms for next Monday .
neutral|ok . There're vacancies . Since the peak season is coming , it's advisable to book soon . Would you like to make a reservation now ?
neutral|yes , please . Do you take credit cards ?
neutral|yes , we accept all major credit cards .
neutral|and how about Internet access ?
neutral|there's free Internet access in the lobby .
neutral|is it available in the rooms ?
neutral|Unfortunately not .
neutral|that's OK . Is breakfast included ?
neutral|yes , breakfast is included and parking is available .
neutral|fantastic . Thank you very much .
neutral|you're welcome . And we have 24 hour reception . Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions .
neutral|I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted .
neutral|You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard .
sadness|You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation .
neutral|What sort of shopping is nearby , Mr . Taylor ?
neutral|Call me John . This is a great area of the city for shopping . There ’ s a grocery store just around the corner .
neutral|What about things other than food ?
neutral|Well , the Riverside Mall has 200 stores in it , including four major department stores .
neutral|Are there small shops near here as well ?
neutral|Yes , on 4th street , near the movie theater there are many specialty shops , including clothing boutiques .
joy|Well , that sounds just wonderful .
joy|Yes , it ’ s a really nice neighborhood .
neutral|Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it .
neutral|Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know.Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more .
neutral|But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished .
neutral|But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely .
neutral|Well , only you liked it really , darling .
neutral|Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy .
neutral|Hi , Bob , everything okay ?
neutral|More or less . There's just one thing bothering me .
surprise|Oh ? What's that ?
neutral|Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
neutral|What gift ?
neutral|It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it .
surprise|You refused the gift ? That's terrible .
neutral|I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way .
neutral|Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
neutral|That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
neutral|I've been looking for a swimming pool , but I haven't found one yet .
neutral|We have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym .
neutral|Swim stations ? Could you be a little more explicit ?
neutral|You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? Well , it's the same thing .
neutral|Gee , that's a great idea . Now , how much do I have to pay ?
neutral|The stations are absolutely free to guests , sir .
neutral|Great ! Now , when can I go down there and use the stations ?
neutral|The swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m .
joy|Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks .
neutral|Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded .
neutral|Hi . Today , I am the interviewer for your visa application .
neutral|OK . Here is my application form and all the documents .
neutral|Can you tell me why do you want a visa to America ?
neutral|Because I want to have a view of the exotic landscapes to extend my views and understanding of the world .
neutral|OK . Do you plan to go to America all by yourself or with your family ?
neutral|Myself .
neutral|Have you finished all you preparation ?
neutral|Yes . Everything is ready .
neutral|What a pity you are leaving so soon . I wish you could stay a few more days . Sir , can you deliver a speech for us ?
neutral|Dear friends . Here , I wish to say a word of thanks for holding this send-off party for me . Actually I didn't expect at all for this . I owe a lot to all of you here . It's been 5 days since I came to visit here . Time really flies . I feel grateful for your welcome and help in the five days . I will miss you while I am leaving . Let's keep in touch in any way . What's more , to the success of our face-to-face meeting , to the upcoming cooperation of our two companies , bottom up !
joy|Cheers ! And we are honored to have such an honored guest today . Mr . James , I hope we will meet somewhere in the near future .
joy|Madam , we also welcome you to visit our company . I hope you can also bring your family there to have a look of our company . In this way , we will know each other better .
joy|Definitely ! Thank you !
neutral|I have been thinking of buying a house and would like to speak with you .
neutral|I have time to speak with you . Where would you like to purchase your house ?
neutral|I am most interested in Pasadena or Arcadia , but would be open to other suggestions .
neutral|How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need ?
neutral|We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home .
neutral|Do you need to be located in a particular school district ?
neutral|It doesn ’ t matter , as we do not have any children .
neutral|Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ?
neutral|In a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake .
joy|Thank you for all of the information . I will help you find the perfect house for you .
neutral|Waiter .
neutral|Would you like anything else ?
neutral|No , thanks . Please bring us the bill .
neutral|All right . And do you want to separate bills or just one single bill ?
neutral|Separate bills , please .
neutral|Here is your bill . It comes to 80 yuan . And yours is 60 yuan .
joy|Here you are . Thank you
neutral|If this coat doesn't fit , may I bring it back later ?
sadness|Sorry , We don't take returns on sale items .
neutral|What are the attractions of that city ?
neutral|It's famous for beautiful countryside with clean air .
neutral|Oh , that's what I am looking for . Do you have a reduction for 6 persons ?
neutral|Yes , sir . We offer a 10 % discount for groups more than 5 .
neutral|I would like to order a waistcoat .
neutral|Have you chosen the material ?
neutral|Yes , I want it to made of tweed .
neutral|Fine . And the charge is $ 100 .
neutral|When will it be available ?
neutral|Next Wednesday .
neutral|Hi , I'm George . I'll be your waiter this evening . Are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes ?
neutral|I'm ready now . I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn .
neutral|And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup .
neutral|I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad .
neutral|Can I get you anything to drink ?
neutral|Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .
neutral|Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
joy|Thank you .
neutral|What is your salary at present ?
neutral|My present pay is 100,000 Yuan per year .
neutral|What are your salary expectations now ?
neutral|I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 120,000 Yuan per year .
neutral|That's a little more than we had planned .
neutral|I think you'll find I'm worth that .
neutral|I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ?
neutral|Yes , it is quite reasonable .
neutral|Excuse me . I've been waiting for my main dish for quite a time .
neutral|Yes , sir.Just a minute , please , I'll check with the kitchen .
sadness|Thank you for waiting.It takes another ten to fifteen minutes , I'm afraid .
surprise|We have an appointment in half an hour .
neutral|I see .
neutral|Do you have anything else I can have instead ?
neutral|Well , yes.How about beef stew ? We can serve you at once .
neutral|I'll take beef stew , then .
joy|Hi , Sally ! You are talking to the proud father of a new baby girl !
surprise|Congratulations , Bob ! That ’ s great news , what ’ s her name ?
neutral|We ’ Ve named her Alice after my wife ’ s grandmother .
joy|That ’ s a pretty name . Give your wife my best !
neutral|Excuse me , can you tell me where is the taxi stand ?
neutral|You can find one at the end of the street .
neutral|Are there any signs there ?
neutral|No.but there are quite many cars .
joy|Thank you .
neutral|Would Dr.Black be able to see me at 9:00 a . m . tomorrow ?
neutral|I'm sorry , but she won't have any openings until 11:00 , unless there's a cancellation .
neutral|Would 1 : OO p . m . be convenient ?
neutral|Yes , she's free then .
neutral|Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache .
neutral|You should go to the dentist .
fear|I hate dentists .
neutral|Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
fear|It always hurts . I hate going .
neutral|Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
neutral|O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go .
neutral|Good . You feel better after you do .
neutral|Sally , you look so corporate ! What interview do you have today ?
neutral|Amalgamated Trading Company . It's Swiss . Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous ?
neutral|Yeah , I guess so . I've never actually heard of this one , but ...
neutral|Well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy .
neutral|You didn't read their brochure or anything , did you ?
sadness|Four times . I'm totally prepared . Oh , no ! I forgot to take off my nail polish ! And I have to be there in 15 minutes ! That's it . I blew it .
neutral|Well , they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish . Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great .
neutral|But the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job .
neutral|Not quite the only one . I really wanted that job at the magazine , but I still haven't heard from them .
neutral|I'm calling to tell you that the merchandise ordered last month has not arrived yet .
neutral|I'm sorry , hold on a moment . I'll check it out . But we have already shipped it to you last month . Would you like us to contact the express company to know what's going on ?
neutral|Please find out the reason as soon as possible . We are in bad need of it .
neutral|Ok , I am terribly sorry for the trouble you are getting into.We will contact you first thing , once we know the reason .
neutral|I really want to make something for dinner .
neutral|What are you going to cook ?
neutral|I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make .
joy|A teriyaki bowl sounds nice .
neutral|I don't know how to make that .
neutral|All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef .
joy|That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ?
neutral|The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice .
neutral|What's next ?
neutral|Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it .
neutral|What's the next thing I need to do ?
neutral|Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy .
neutral|How do I submit an expense report ?
neutral|You need all your receipts for reimbursement .
neutral|You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ?
neutral|Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ’ ll get it signed for you .
neutral|Good morning !
neutral|Can I speak to Miss Cooper please ?
neutral|Would you hold on a second , please ? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged .
surprise|Engaged . Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ?
neutral|I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long .
neutral|How long do you think she'll be ?
neutral|I really can't say how long she'll be .
neutral|Can I leave a message , please ?
neutral|Yes , certainly .
neutral|Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ?
neutral|Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like .
neutral|Thank you very much .
neutral|Excuse me , waiter , would you please bring us a nest ? A friend of mine will join us .
neutral|Wait a moment . Here you are .
neutral|By the way , we would like to order some dishes for my friend .
joy|Sure .
neutral|Can you help me out , Chuck ?
neutral|Sure . What's it , Yvonne ?
neutral|I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move .
neutral|Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other .
neutral|Good morning . Madam . What can I do for you today ?
neutral|Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card .
neutral|What seems to be the problem ?
neutral|I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it .
neutral|Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ?
surprise|No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it !
neutral|You said you received your card this morning , am I right ?
neutral|Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ?
neutral|Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .
joy|Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me .
neutral|Can you manage chopsticks ?
neutral|Why not ? See .
joy|Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ?
joy|Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG .
surprise|What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food .
neutral|According to some studies it may cause cancer .
neutral|Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population .
neutral|I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated .
neutral|I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons .
neutral|Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ?
sadness|It was a nightmare .
neutral|What ’ s up ?
neutral|Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
neutral|Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
sadness|Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .
neutral|This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?
sadness|I am still waiting for their call .
neutral|Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward .
neutral|Do you have any seat preferences , sir ?
neutral|Yes , could you put me in the no-smoking section ?
neutral|Yes . Would you like a window seat ?
neutral|If one's available , please . But not over the wing .
neutral|morning . Rent-A-Car Agency . May I help you ?
neutral|Good morning . This is Paul Alexander calling from the Isis Advertising Firm . We need a car to the airport for Mr . Phillips .
neutral|Certainly , Mr . Alexander . When would Mr . Phillips like to leave ?
neutral|Let me check ... His flight ’ s at 2:30 p . m . , so he should leave no later than 12 noon .
neutral|I'm calling today about a bill that I never received .
neutral|Can you tell me which credit card it was for ?
neutral|It was for my Master Card .
neutral|You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago .
neutral|I haven't got it in the mail yet .
neutral|The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed .
neutral|What am I supposed to do about my bill then ?
neutral|Maybe you should call your post office .
neutral|But if it's their mistake , can I get an extension on my bill payment ?
neutral|Yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake .
neutral|Okay , thank you very much for your help .
neutral|Not a problem . Enjoy the rest of your day .
neutral|Jenny , don't you think it's really charming ?
neutral|Yes . It's a feast of eyes to walking in the museum .
neutral|Let's take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum .
neutral|What a shame that we can't take pictures .
neutral|OK , Allen . It's your turn . Are you ready ?
neutral|I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ?
anger|Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song !
neutral|I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night .
neutral|Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves " The King . "
neutral|I'll put the song at the front of the list .
neutral|Here is the document you asked for this morning .
joy|Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks .
neutral|You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later .
joy|This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ?
neutral|The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
joy|Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do .
neutral|How are you doing , Jim ?
neutral|Fine , just fine.How about you ?
neutral|Not too bad .
joy|I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job .
joy|Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract .
neutral|What's for lunch ?
neutral|Pork chops .
neutral|What happened to you ?
neutral|I think I caught a cold .
neutral|Do you have any symptoms ?
neutral|Runny nose and coughing .
neutral|Do you have a fever ?
neutral|I have just taken the temperature , I don't think so .
neutral|It's not serious .
neutral|Are you sure ?
neutral|Yes .
neutral|What should I do ?
neutral|You should drink more hot water , and do some exercise .
neutral|What kind of place shall we rent ?
neutral|It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .
neutral|Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
neutral|Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area .
neutral|I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
joy|Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
neutral|Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
neutral|How much do you think the rent will be ?
neutral|I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
neutral|I don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . It's too soon .
neutral|Well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June ?
neutral|The earliest we can do is by the end of June .
neutral|Did you have any working experience during college ?
neutral|Yes , I did some part-time jobs such as English tutor , salesman , and model .
neutral|What did you learn from your part-time jobs ?
neutral|I learned to be patient , professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
joy|Smells good ! What ’ s for breakfast ?
joy|Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !
joy|Nice ! Brunch !
joy|Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
joy|Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?
neutral|Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
joy|Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
neutral|Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup !
neutral|Can you tell me if there is a flight to New York ?
neutral|Yes . Flight DB117 departs at 5:38 pm and arrives in New York at 6:00 am with a layover in Chicago . It also makes a refueling stop at Colombia .
neutral|So many stops ! Don't you have any direct flights ?
neutral|Sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now .
neutral|Hello.Hot water overflowed from the bathtub.Will you help me ?
neutral|Would you turn off the tap ?
neutral|I did it .
neutral|Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ?
neutral|OK . I will .
neutral|I'll have our housekeeper come right away .
neutral|I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep .
neutral|When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .
neutral|Right.Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?
neutral|Would you like some more coffee ?
neutral|No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .
neutral|The waitress is bringing the bill right now .
neutral|This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ?
neutral|Yes , this waitress did a great job .
neutral|OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 .
neutral|What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ?
neutral|Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ?
neutral|Yes , 20 % would be perfect .
neutral|Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 .
joy|Yes , that was one fantastic meal !
joy|I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week .
neutral|It ’ s time for me to go now .
neutral|Would you like me to go with you ?
neutral|I ’ d rather you stayed in the office and did these things .
neutral|Do you want to type that letter ?
neutral|I ’ d rather you typed it .
neutral|Do you want to tell her ?
neutral|I ’ d rather you told her .
neutral|Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head .
neutral|What crime did I commit ?
neutral|You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs , so we are taking you into custody . We ’ Ve found some heroin in your house . You have the following rights while you are being interviewed . You have the right to remain silent . You don't have to make any statement against your will . You have the right to defense counsel . You have the right to request an investigation of evidence favorable to your case . Do you understand your rights ?
neutral|I am innocent .
neutral|Would you like to come by and play bridge ?
neutral|Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time .
neutral|Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired .
neutral|Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies .
neutral|Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ?
neutral|Well , do you have any suggestions ?
neutral|Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?
neutral|It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .
neutral|Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
neutral|OK .
neutral|Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ?
neutral|Tom , it's time for you to go to bed .
neutral|Good night , mum .
neutral|Good night .
neutral|Operator . May I help you ?
neutral|Yes . How do I get an outside line , please ?
neutral|Just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . Or we can place a call for you , if you want .
joy|No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself .
neutral|What's our target audience for this campaign ?
neutral|This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two .
neutral|Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ?
neutral|Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here .
neutral|Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ?
neutral|Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year .
neutral|John , I'd like to see you in my office for a minute .
neutral|Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment .
neutral|John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion .
joy|Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department .
neutral|Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it .
surprise|Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff .
neutral|You've earned it .
neutral|How can I help you today ?
neutral|I am returning something that I bought yesterday .
neutral|What would you like to return ?
neutral|I'm returning a cellphone .
neutral|Was there something wrong with it ?
neutral|It's defective .
neutral|What isn't working on it ?
neutral|It keeps turning off on it's own .
neutral|Alright , do you have the receipt ?
neutral|I have it right here .
neutral|I'm going to take care of this and refund your money .
joy|Thanks for your help .
sadness|I miss grandma . I dreamed about her yesterday .
neutral|Dear , let ’ s drop the subject .
neutral|Good morning , sir . Can I help you ?
neutral|Good morning . I'd like to cash this check .
neutral|Yes , sir . Can you show you identity ?
neutral|What about the driving license ?
neutral|Don't you have any other identification ?
neutral|I am sorry . I only have my driving license with me .
neutral|Ok . Would you please sign your name on the back of the check ?
neutral|Thank you . Here you are .
neutral|How do you want your money ?
neutral|Would you give me some in twenties and tens ?
neutral|All right . Please wait for a moment .
neutral|Could you fill in this form , please ?
neutral|All right .
neutral|Have you got any identification ?
neutral|Yes , here's my ID card .
anger|Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !
neutral|What ? What did you buy ?
anger|It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
neutral|What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
neutral|There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .
neutral|And ?
neutral|So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
neutral|And it's a brick ?
neutral|Yes .
neutral|I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
neutral|I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .
neutral|So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
neutral|Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .
neutral|But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
neutral|He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
neutral|Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !
neutral|C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
neutral|That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
neutral|You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?
neutral|Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ?
neutral|Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision .
neutral|Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you .
neutral|Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign .
surprise|Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat !
sadness|Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times .
neutral|Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription .
neutral|Thanks doc !
neutral|Arthur , that ’ s the bathroom .
neutral|Would you like some more coffee ?
neutral|No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .
neutral|Good luck finding the waitress !
neutral|The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ?
neutral|I'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way .
neutral|Good . I'll just stay here until you get back .
neutral|So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner .
neutral|How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ?
neutral|I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service .
neutral|I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight .
neutral|I think that we should leave 10 % .
neutral|$ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip .
neutral|I want to fly to Congo on Monday , the 17th .
neutral|Let me see what's available .
neutral|By the way , I'd prefer a night flight .
neutral|Africa Airline 551 leaves at 9:00 pm .
neutral|That's fine . I want to pay in cash . Here is the money .
neutral|How much was your watch ?
neutral|Take a guess .
sadness|A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too .
neutral|Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ?
neutral|Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days .
neutral|Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery .
surprise|But I'm going on a business trip in two days !
neutral|Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others .
neutral|Would you care for a drink ?
neutral|No , thanks . I'm fine .
neutral|Let's go practice your driving .
neutral|If that's what you want to do , then we can .
neutral|Did you buckle your seatbelt ?
neutral|I'm buckled up . What's next ?
neutral|You need to start the car now .
neutral|What do you want me to do ?
neutral|Go left .
neutral|How far should I go ?
neutral|I'll let you know when I want you to stop .
neutral|Tell me before you want me to stop .
neutral|All right , try parking here .
joy|Thanks . Let's go driving again tomorrow .
neutral|How may I help you ?
neutral|I ’ m making a deposit today .
neutral|Cash or check ?
neutral|I would like to deposit a check .
neutral|You need to sign the back .
neutral|Okay . Here you go .
neutral|Would you like cash back ?
neutral|Yes , I would .
neutral|How much ?
neutral|Let me get $ 150 back .
neutral|Here you go .
joy|Thank you . Have a good one .
neutral|I'd like to extend my visa for another two years .
neutral|Are you on a tourist visa or a student visa ?
neutral|Student visa .
neutral|What is the reason for extension ?
neutral|I'll go into a practical training as soon as I receive my Master ’ s degree from the University of Pennsylvania early next month .
neutral|We ’ ll need a letter from your university and a financial statement from you .
neutral|Do you like the apartment ?
joy|I absolutely love the apartment .
neutral|Everything is okay ?
neutral|I do have one problem with the apartment .
neutral|What ’ s the problem ?
neutral|I don ’ t like all those stains in the carpet .
neutral|We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment .
neutral|I did not know that .
neutral|I assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me .
neutral|That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment .
joy|I ’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice .
joy|It ’ s absolutely incredible . I ’ ll take it .
neutral|Come in , Arnold . Have a seat .
neutral|Good morning .
neutral|Would you like something to drink ?
neutral|No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk .
neutral|So , you're a serious coffee drinker .
neutral|Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted .
neutral|Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ?
neutral|No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker .
neutral|Well , what would you like to talk to me about ?
neutral|I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .
neutral|I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it .
neutral|It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .
neutral|Yes .
neutral|Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here .
neutral|What do you suggest ?
neutral|The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .
neutral|You mean because people have to go across town to get here .
neutral|Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .
neutral|That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them .
neutral|I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them .
neutral|I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .
neutral|Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .
neutral|Well .
neutral|I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .
neutral|You mean you want to run the meetings ?
neutral|No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .
neutral|Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks .
neutral|I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized .
neutral|I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .
joy|Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .
neutral|I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . "
neutral|Do you have a good English-Chinese dictionary ?
neutral|Sure . How about this one ?
neutral|Is this the latest edition ?
neutral|Yes . We have both the paperback and the hardcover .
neutral|What's the difference ?
neutral|The hardcover is more expensive .
joy|Oh ! I see . I'll have the paperback , please .

neutral|Well , the afternoon will be fine .
neutral|First class or economy ?
neutral|First class will be preferred .

neutral|It hurts smack in the middle of my gut !
neutral|Did this just come on suddenly ?
neutral|I felt OK until an hour or so ago , and then I just doubled over .
neutral|Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently ?
neutral|No , and I don ’ t usually get a lot of stomachaches .
neutral|We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is .
neutral|I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this . Thank you .
neutral|May I help you ?
neutral|Yes , I would like to exchange some money .
neutral|what currency would you like to trade in ?
neutral|I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ?
neutral|No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ?
neutral|Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ?
neutral|It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ?
neutral|I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow !
neutral|Has your son started school yet , Tom ?
neutral|Next week , it ’ s going to be quite a shock for him !
neutral|He ’ ll get used to it . They always do . I still remember when my daughter started . Are you going with him on his first day ?
joy|You bet . I wouldn ’ t miss it !
neutral|May I speak to Mr.Huang , please ?
neutral|I'm sorry . Mr.Huang is quite busy right now . Could I pass him the message ?
neutral|Well , you see , I won't be able to keep my 9
neutral|Let me see . He's free from 3:00 to 4:30 tomorrow afternoon . Can you make it then ?
joy|Yes , of course . Thank you very much .
joy|You're quite welcome . Thank you for calling . Bye-byeB
neutral|Dad , hurry ! The train is coming . Aha , I am a superman .
neutral|Don't rush , behave yourself please ! Let the people get off first .
neutral|Oh , we should . There are so many people . What if the train got full before we could get in ?
neutral|But , if we all pushed our way in , nobody could get off , and nobody could get in either .
neutral|How many stops are there to the Aidan station ?
neutral|There are four more stops .
surprise|Oh , my God !
neutral|What's wrong ? You are like a little monkey , on pins and needles !
neutral|Because I need to use the restroom . Is there a restroom on the train ?
neutral|No , not on the train , but in the station .
neutral|Why not ? You told me that subway is a kind of train . If it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ?
neutral|Well , that is a question . You want to offer a suggestion ?
neutral|Oh , yeah , but not today . I am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible .
neutral|I guess you'll never forget today .
joy|This broth is wonderful . What's in it ?
joy|Lamb and beef . It will get even tastier when we add the veggies !
neutral|Hey ! Watch out ! You're using the same spoon for both broths !
surprise|So ?
neutral|You're getting that hot stuff in my mild broth !
neutral|You'll be OK . It's just a little bit ...

neutral|... Here you go
joy|Thanks . Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order , please .
neutral|I'm sorry , but can you give me a three-day turnaround ?
neutral|If you don't mind paying a little extra , it's absolutely no problem .
neutral|Lisa , is there a milk section ?
neutral|No , there's no such section . The dairy section is where you'll find milk and cheese .
neutral|What's Condiments ?
neutral|That's where you'll find things like salt and pepper .
neutral|Oh , I see .
neutral|Let's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight .
joy|Great ! Pasta for dinner .
neutral|And let's get a loaf of bread at the bakery for breakfast .
neutral|Maybe we should get a shopping cart .
neutral|I'll put the shopping basket back .
neutral|Did you lock the doors ?
neutral|All except the back door . I left that open for Tim . He took the dog for a walk .
neutral|Well , I'm going on to bed . I'm beat .
neutral|Okay . I'm going to stay up a while . I've got to go over the household budget . We're a little overspent this month .
neutral|Please tell Tim to close the door to the basement . I don't want the dog down there tonight .
neutral|Okay . Good night . See you at breakfast .
joy|Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened .
neutral|I feel kind of stupid .
neutral|Why ?
neutral|We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet .
surprise|You got lost . You're kidding !
neutral|No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .
neutral|You could have called .
neutral|I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .
surprise|You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?
neutral|Guess where we ended up .
neutral|I don't know . Where ?
neutral|When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield .
surprise|Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?
neutral|I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
neutral|Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
neutral|I know it is . I don't know how it happened .
neutral|Hmm , maybe I do .
neutral|What ?
neutral|Maybe I have an idea how it happened .
neutral|How ?
neutral|You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .
neutral|Oh , that's what you think , huh ?
neutral|Won't you have some of this ?
joy|Yes , thanks .
neutral|It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue .
joy|It's very good . How do you make it ?
neutral|I use a special dressing and homemade catsup .
joy|This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day .
joy|I'm glad you like it .
neutral|You Americans usually have nutritious food .
joy|Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ?
neutral|We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience .
neutral|I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night .
neutral|I like these shoes .
neutral|Do you realize that all these shoes are half off ?
surprise|Really ?
neutral|Yes , but the offer only lasts this week .
neutral|Do you have experience in advertising ?
neutral|Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company .
neutral|What were you mean duties there ?
neutral|I mostly did advertising planning .
neutral|What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?
neutral|I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
neutral|What was the most important thing you have learned at work ?
neutral|The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact in success . If I want to make in marking in advertising history , I can ’ t stop studying and creating .
neutral|Dad , may I have a room of my own ?
neutral|Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room .
sadness|Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night .
neutral|Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ?
neutral|Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it .
neutral|Come in and sit down , Jack . Now , what's the trouble ?
neutral|I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor .
neutral|I see . When did it start ?
neutral|It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper .
neutral|Have you got a temperature ?
neutral|I think so . I feel very hot .
neutral|Let's see . Yes . You ' Ve got quite a high temperature .
neutral|I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts .
neutral|Hm ... I think you ' Ve got the flu .
neutral|Is it serious ?
neutral|No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
neutral|How often must I take it ?
neutral|Three times a day after meals .
neutral|Thank you , Doctor.Goodbye .

neutral|Why don ’ t you sit down and relax , darling ?
neutral|I don ’ t want to .
neutral|Well , come and talk to me then .
neutral|Certainly not .
neutral|May I turn on the radio then ?
surprise|Turn on the radio ? What for ?
neutral|So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
neutral|Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you ?
neutral|Ok , I will . But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner .
neutral|To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop .
neutral|Good afternoon , ma'am . May I help you ?
neutral|Yes . Can I deposit valuables here ?
neutral|Of course , you can . Please put your articles in this bag and seal it .
neutral|OK .
neutral|Thank you . Here is your tag .
neutral|Would you tell me the rate per day for depositing my bag ?
neutral|Sure , madam . Only one dollar .
neutral|When does the cloakroom close ?
neutral|This cloakroom is open until 10 p . m .
neutral|Oh , dear ! I won't be back until about 11:30 tonight . Where can I pick up my bag ?

neutral|6 hours . If you are in a hurry we can develop it in 3 hours .
neutral|There is no need . I will come back tomorrow .
neutral|Good afternoon Miss , would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? You know , you can never get enough .
neutral|I think my husband has some .
neutral|Are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? If something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you .
neutral|That ’ s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ’ s education . I can ’ t afford that by myself .
neutral|Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ?
neutral|Certainly .
joy|The buildings are really magnificent .
neutral|Yes , millions of travelers come here every year for the view of the buildings .
neutral|The journey is worth while . Where are we going after this ?
neutral|We will visit the Statue of Liberty as scheduled .
neutral|Excuse me .
neutral|Yes ?
neutral|Do you have any information about the city sights ?
neutral|Sure . There ’ s a lot here in this pamphlet .
neutral|Thank you . And what ’ s the best way to get downtown ?
neutral|Take the subway . It ’ s $ 1.50 per ride . You can buy a petrol card at the station .
neutral|You ’ Ve been very helpful .
neutral|My pleasure .
neutral|I want to open a saving account , sir.What ' s the proper procedure ?
neutral|First , you fill out the application form and then we'll issue you a passbook .
neutral|Is there any minimum for the first deposit ?
neutral|No , Even a dollar is all right.Here ' s your passbook , sir ; just sign your name on it .
neutral|What is the annual interest rate ?
neutral|It varies from time to time.At present it is 6 % .
neutral|By the way , can I open a checking account too ?
neutral|By all means.But you have to deposit enough money before you can write out your checks .
neutral|You look depressed . What's on your mind ?
sadness|Well , I had a blood test last week . The doctor said that I have high blood pressure and my blood is thick and sticky . I'm very worried .
neutral|Take it easy . When we last talked , you promised there would be more exercises in your life . But now you are putting on some weight .
neutral|I have to admit it's easier said than done .
neutral|Well , I think it's time for you to change your eating habits and develop a healthy lifestyle . Regular exercise will improve your health .
neutral|But you know I'm just not into exercises . And I wouldn't have time for exercises , either .
neutral|You can do some jogging . It's easy and it doesn't take much time .
neutral|Actually , my doctor said the same thing .
neutral|Excuse me , sir , but you have to put your bags here before entering the market .
neutral|Oh . I am sorry . I was busy looking for some whisky.Can you tell me the exactly place where I can find any ?
neutral|Yes , it's on the third floor .
neutral|Here ' s my passport . I'm a visiting scholar .
neutral|Do you have anything to declare ?
neutral|No , these are all my personal effects .
neutral|What's in the bag ? Would you mind opening the bag ?
neutral|Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable . Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ?
neutral|NO . You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings .
neutral|Thank you .
neutral|Do you work well under pressure ?
neutral|Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind working under pressure . I work well under that circumstance . People can , I can .
neutral|Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
neutral|No , nothing in particular .
neutral|How soon can you begin working for us ?
neutral|I need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities . I will quit then transfer to your company .
neutral|What do you want ?
neutral|I think I have a piece of apple pie .
neutral|Do you want something to drink ?
neutral|Coffee would be fine .
neutral|OK . Sit down and I'll get it .
neutral|Our new production control program's going live on Monday . The old and the new programs will operate in tandem for four to six weeks . That should give us time to iron out any little problems .
neutral|Hope it all goes well . We're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year .
neutral|Yes , I realise that . We've spent a long time planning and preparing for the change-over . I'm confident we won't have any major problems .
neutral|Who broke my chair ?
neutral|It wasn't me .
neutral|Can I help you , Madam ?
neutral|Could you tell me what Ants on the Tree is please ?
neutral|Certainly , Madam . It's a stir fried dish of minced pork with glass noodles .
joy|Sounds nice . I'll have that please .
neutral|Finance , Angie speaking .
neutral|Hi Angie , it ’ s Tom Reynolds here . Can you tell me if my tuition fees for this semester have been approved ?
neutral|Yes , Mr . Reynolds . They were approved yesterday . You can pick up the check today .
joy|Oh wow ! Thanks a million , Angie !
neutral|Come in , please .
neutral|Good morning , sir !
neutral|Good morning , please make yourself comfortable .
neutral|Thank you , sir .
neutral|Your name and examination number , please .
neutral|My name is Du Tao , number 3 .
neutral|Pardon ?
neutral|Du Tao . D-U for Du and T-A - 0 for Tao .
neutral|Yes , Mr . Du , when were you born ?
neutral|I was born on January 1st , 1988 . I ’ m 20 years old now .
neutral|Where do you live ?
neutral|I ’ m living at Room 222 , Building 18 , N . P . U .
neutral|Can you leave me your phone number ?
neutral|Gladly , 8962105 2 .
neutral|Good morning . May I help you ?
neutral|Yes . I'm looking for an apartment , I'd like two bedrooms .
neutral|All right . Have a seat , please . Let me ask you a few questions . First of all , may I have your name , please ?
neutral|My name's Donald Eakins .
neutral|How do you spell your last name , Mr.Eakins .
neutral|It's E-A-K-I-N-S .
neutral|E-A-K-I-N-S.First name , Donald . And what's your present address , Mr.Eakins ?
neutral|It's 1446 Pine Street .
neutral|1446 Pine . That's in San Francisco , isn't it ?
neutral|Yes , it is .
neutral|Did you check before you left the shop ?
neutral|Yes , I did . But when I got home , my son put it on and we found the hole .
neutral|Really ? Let me have a look at it . Mm . OK . Let me change it for another one .
joy|Thank you very much .
neutral|I hate to do this , but I've got to cancel a reservation I made earlier this week .
neutral|All I need is your name , phone , and reservation date .
neutral|My name is Rudy Randolph . I'm at 818-555-1234 . The reservation was for April 9 .
neutral|Randolph , Rudy . Let me hit one button , sir , and now your reservation is cancelled .
fear|Okay , thank you . I'll make another reservation as soon as I can .
fear|It's been my pleasure to help you .
neutral|Did you go and buy your bus pass ?
neutral|No , I didn't .
neutral|When are you going to go get it ?
neutral|I'm not sure where they sell bus passes at .
neutral|Why didn't you just ask me ?
neutral|Where should I go ?
neutral|You can get one from student services .
neutral|I had no clue that I could get it there .
neutral|I already knew that .
joy|Thanks for letting me know .
joy|You're welcome .
neutral|I'm going to go and get it right now .
neutral|Tomorrow is my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ?
neutral|Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code .
neutral|Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt .
neutral|Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean .
neutral|Excuse me . Will you please keep an eye on my suitcase ? I just want to make a phone call .
neutral|Certainly , but will it take long ?
neutral|No , I'll be right back .
neutral|OK . I'll look after it then .
neutral|Mike's Mechanics . Can I help you ?
neutral|Yes , how do I get to your shop from Chilin ?
neutral|Go straight up Zhongshan Road and you will see our sign on your right , after you pass the museum .
joy|Thank you very much .
neutral|Don't take too much off . I'm trying to grow my hair longer .
neutral|How about two inches ?
joy|That sounds perfect . Do you think I can get some highlights today , too ? I've always wanted red .
neutral|I think that will over-process your hair , you should wait at least two weeks .
neutral|All right . I'll just have the cut and perm today .
joy|Great . My assistant will wash your hair , and then I'll be back to help you .
neutral|OK .
anger|Oh , damn . There ’ s another traffic jam on the highway .
neutral|How can there be a traffic jam on a 16 - lane highway every day ?
neutral|There are just too many people , and too many cars .
neutral|I wonder if there was an accident .
neutral|No , they just said it too many people were trying to get off at the Capitol exits .
neutral|Well , let ’ s put on some music . We ’ re going to be stuck in this for a while .
neutral|All right , what do you want to listen to ?
neutral|How about some Beatles ?
joy|Yeah , all right .
neutral|Excuse me . Mr . Emory ?
neutral|Yes , Ms . Rodriguez ? How can I help you ?
neutral|I wanted to see if I could arrange a meeting with you to discuss recruitment .
neutral|Absolutely . I ’ Ve been wanting to meet with you about that . Let me just get my book .
neutral|Who ate the cookies that were sitting here ?
neutral|I did , Mom .
anger|Shame on you . I was saving them for your brother .
neutral|Hello . May I speak to Brian , please ?
sadness|Sorry , you have the wrong number . There ’ s no Brian here .
neutral|Is this 777-9345 ?
neutral|No , it ’ s 777-9344 ?
sadness|Oh , I ’ m so sorry .
joy|That ’ s OK .
neutral|Put all baggage on the conveyor belt . Walk through the detector age one at a time , please .
neutral|Excuse me , ma'ma . Could you walk back through the doorway again , please ?
neutral|What for ?
neutral|Airport security . Could you empty your pockets over here , please ?
neutral|Really ? I'm in a hurry . All right .
neutral|Ah , a set of keys .
sadness|I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry .
neutral|That's all right . Enjoy your flight .
neutral|Thank you .
neutral|What's the matter with you , Paul ?
neutral|I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold .
neutral|Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest .
neutral|Yeah , I will .
neutral|Come on . All of us are waiting for you .
neutral|Oh , sorry . Cross my fingers .
neutral|Come on , Mary . We have to do the laundry .
neutral|Where are we going ?
neutral|Down to the basement .
neutral|Do you have a washer down there ?
neutral|Yes . We have a dryer , too .
neutral|That's so convenient . Where are the dirty clothes ?
neutral|They are in the basement already .
neutral|But I didn't see you carry them down .
neutral|Don't you know that we have a laundry chute in the house ?
neutral|Hi , John .
neutral|Oh , hi , Mary , come on in . Any problem ?
neutral|Oh , no problem .
joy|Great . I forgot to ask you , though . How long did you want the place ?
neutral|Six months .
neutral|Oh , well , that might be a problem . I usually only sign one year leases .
neutral|Well , one year would be fine , too . I ’ m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon .
neutral|Well , if it ’ s not a problem . Then here you go .
neutral|Just let me look at it quickly .
joy|Of course .
neutral|Looks like a standard lease .
neutral|Yeah , and don ’ t worry about the security deposit . If everything ’ s all right when you move out , you ’ ll get it back .
neutral|O . K . Great . Just sign and date it here ?
joy|Yes . Thanks . You can move your stuff in tomorrow .
joy|Wonderful .
neutral|Excuse me , could you tell me the bookshop ’ s address ?
neutral|Yes , the bookshop is just around the corner.Turn left and you ’ ll see the bookshop .
joy|Thank you very much.By the way , is the hospital beside the bookshop .
neutral|Right , if you see the bookshop , you can see the hospital .
joy|Thank you for your help .
joy|Not at all .
neutral|Hello ! Is this Mr . Chang ?
neutral|Yes . Who is speaking ?
neutral|This is Kelly speaking . I am calling from London . How are you , Mr . Chang ?
neutral|Oh , Kelly , I couldn't recognize your voice . Well , I'm fine .
neutral|Mr . Chang , I just want to tell you that we are leaving London for Beijing by flight CP 645 on Saturday morning . Could you meet us at the airport , please ?
neutral|Excuse me , I couldn't quite hear you . This line is crossed . Can you speak louder , please ?
neutral|I will say it again ... Do you hear me now ?
neutral|Much better . I will definitely go to the airport to meet you .
neutral|Thank you very much . Goodbye .
neutral|Goodbye .
neutral|Hello , Mr . Hammer . Jack Ross here . I'm calling to confirm our appointment on Monday at ten o'clock in your office .
neutral|Yes . Everything's all set .
neutral|I'd like to bring Mr . Huang and Ms . Sun with me .
neutral|We're supposed to be meeting alone .
neutral|I know , but I think they may add something valuable to the discussion .
neutral|Fine . But no one else , OK ?
neutral|Yes , Mr . Hammer .
joy|How beautiful the flower is !
joy|Really , it's so beautiful .
joy|You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you .
neutral|You mustn't pick it in this place .
neutral|Where it is ?
neutral|It's a private garden .
neutral|You look fresh recently . And .. what's your weight now ?
neutral|110 pounds .
neutral|Really ? Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . How did you make it ? Did you keep on a diet ?
neutral|No , you know I can't bear eating less .
neutral|Then do the slim pills take effect on you ?
neutral|I've quit it already . I go to aerobics class everyday instead .
neutral|How's it going on ?
neutral|You see . I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite .
neutral|I'd better exercise my body too . My limbs are rusty now .
neutral|I don't think so . You look full of energy every day . Time has stood still with you .
joy|Thank you .
neutral|Ahhs ! I'm beat !
surprise|What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado !
neutral|I just got back from fighting the crowds .
neutral|You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ?
neutral|Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ...
joy|Cool !
neutral|Grabbing , pushing and shoving ...
joy|Thank god you are open ! I have an emergency !
neutral|Hello , Mr . Henderson what can I do for you ?
neutral|I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP !
neutral|OK , I can have it ready by the end of the week .
fear|No , you don ’ t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ’ s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ’ s gonna kill me !
neutral|OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ’ t guarantee we can remove it completely .
neutral|Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ?
joy|Certainly .
joy|Great ! This is our secret ! If you see my wife , say nothing to her about this !
neutral|How often does the bus run ?
neutral|Every five minutes .
neutral|Oh , here comes a bus !
neutral|It comes on the dot .
joy|My warmest congratulations on your promotion !
neutral|Thanks . It ’ s nothing special actually .
neutral|Don ’ t say that . It owes to your efforts and team spirit .
neutral|Oh , it was nothing . Anyone could have done it . I still have a lot to learn yet .
joy|You are very modest . Best luck in your new position .
neutral|Thank you . I won ’ t let this promotion change me .
fear|Yes , emergency . There is a huge fire here .
neutral|Calm down , sir . What's your name and where are you now ?
neutral|My name is Jerry and we are on the intersection of West Road and East Road .
neutral|Sir , leave the house if the fire draws any closer to your house . Our men will be over in 5 minutes .
neutral|Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?
neutral|Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .
neutral|Totally agree . What is your solution ?
neutral|Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .
neutral|You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
neutral|It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
neutral|But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
neutral|I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
neutral|Excuse me , is this the parcel counter ?
neutral|Yes , what can I do for you ?
neutral|I'd like to send this parcel , please .
neutral|What's in it , please ?
neutral|Some books and newspapers .
neutral|OK . please fill in this form and label it .
neutral|Is it all right ?
neutral|Yeah . And would you like to mail it by air ?
neutral|No , I'd rather send it by sea .
neutral|Thirteen yuan , please . Here is the receipt and change .
joy|Thank you .
joy|You are welcome .
neutral|But Ernie , we're still missing something . We need someone to play the music !
neutral|Oh right ... you know , my friend Eric is a DJ . Maybe he would like to play with us .
neutral|Hmm ... does he have a good ear for hip hop music ?
neutral|Well , I don't know , but we can find out . We can talk to him and ask if he wants to join our group .
neutral|Excuse me , is there any room available ? I want a single one .
neutral|Yes . When do you want it ?
neutral|Next Today . By the way , is there a closed circuit TV ?
neutral|Yes , sir .
neutral|What about laundry ?
neutral|Sorry , sir . You have to pay by yourself .
neutral|What time does the museum close ? Any idea ?
neutral|I'm not sure , but I think It's open until 4 o'clock .
neutral|What time is it now ?
neutral|It's a quarter past three .
neutral|I would like to buy some local handcrafts as gifts to my friends and relatives .
neutral|There are many stores selling handcrafts in Paris . Our store is wellknown for vase , table wear and jewelry boxes . You can take your time and choose whatever you like .
joy|Well , the tapestry is delicate and beautiful .
neutral|You have made an excellent choice , it is our newcomer . The tapestry is on hot sell with the design and quality . The design on it is traditional Paris architecture .
neutral|How much is it ?
neutral|100 frances .
joy|Mmm , it is reasonable . Look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful !
neutral|We have a piece of table clothing to go with it . It is a brocade one with pretty stars .
neutral|This silver vase is a good ornament for the living room .
neutral|You are right .
neutral|I will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase .
neutral|OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now .
joy|All right . I will take one .
neutral|It's so boring .
neutral|Don't you like it ?
neutral|I don't . Is there anything worth watching on the other channel ?
neutral|I think it's a basketball match on channel 5 .
neutral|Do you mind if we switch over ?
neutral|Well , I'd rather see a movie .
neutral|What's the movie ?
neutral|' Star war ' .
joy|It must be interesting .
joy|Yes , you're right .
neutral|Where can I get my baggage ?
neutral|Are you from a domestic flight or an international one ?
neutral|An international one from Seattle .
neutral|In that case , you should go to the baggage hall over there .
neutral|Oh yes , I see the sign , thank you .
anger|Man ! That car almost hit me !
neutral|Yeah , that was close .
neutral|Excuse me .
neutral|Yes ?
neutral|Could you tell me where the copy room is ?
neutral|Sure . You just walk down this hallway . The copy room is the second room on the right .
sadness|Doctor , save my baby , please
neutral|What symptoms does he have ?
neutral|He has had a fever for one day . Just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . We were at a loss what to do . We called an ambulance and brought the baby here .
neutral|How long did the convulsion last ?
neutral|About 3 minutes .
neutral|Does he have any other complaints ?
neutral|Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever .
neutral|Have you taken his temperature ?
neutral|It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now .
neutral|Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash .
neutral|Is it serious ? Is it meningitis ?
neutral|No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection .
neutral|Does he have to be admitted to hospital ?
neutral|No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38 ° C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink .
neutral|Thank you very much , doctor .
joy|Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ?
joy|Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets !
joy|Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun !
neutral|I see what you mean . He ’ s really cute . How old is he ?
joy|Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! I ’ Ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me ! Let ’ s get started !
joy|Ok , let ’ s start opening some presents !
joy|Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ’ s so great ! Thank you !
neutral|This next one is from Betty .
joy|A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it !
neutral|One more from Carla .
joy|A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed !
neutral|OK , that ’ s all of them . No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ?
fear|Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital !
joy|Wow , this is amazing . I'm glad we've come here . So cool .
joy|I always love skiing . You know , it's a cool game for cool people . Stay with me and you will be cool , too .
joy|Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .
neutral|Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
neutral|See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
neutral|Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
neutral|You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ?
neutral|They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
neutral|Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?
surprise|Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?
neutral|Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .
neutral|Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
neutral|Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
neutral|It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
joy|It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing .
neutral|Here we go .
neutral|Would you like a smoking or non-smoking room ?
neutral|Non-smoking , please .
neutral|Good morning ! May I help you ?
neutral|Yes . My wife and I are interested in renting a house for the summer .
neutral|Do you want a furnished house or an unfurnished one ?
neutral|Furnished .
neutral|Very well . How long do you want the house ? All summer ?
neutral|No , not all summer . Just for six weeks .
sadness|I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months .
neutral|My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks.Is the house in good condition ?
neutral|Yes , it is . It was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences .
neutral|Hello . Capital Hotel . May I help you ?
neutral|Yes , unlikely my flight will be 2 hours due to the fog . Would you please keep my reservation ?

neutral|That's good to hear . You've had an ideal recovery from your operation . We're going to send you home tomorrow .
neutral|Do you think I can get back to work very soon ?
neutral|Don't be in such a hurry . I'm confident that you'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks .
neutral|Is there anything I should do ?
neutral|You'd better have a good rest for a week . Be sure to have regular meals . Stay away from alcohol.Give up smoking at least a little while .
neutral|Should I take some medicine ?
neutral|Yes . I'm going to give you some.Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . For that one , two tablets . And remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks , please .
joy|It's very kind of you .
joy|You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery.Goodbye .
neutral|Sir , would you like some dessert now ?
neutral|Please show me the menu again .
neutral|Here you are . sir , the chocolate cake is very delicious .
neutral|No , thanks . I don't like chocolate . I'd like strawberry pie .
neutral|I am afraid there is none .
neutral|Then I'll have vanilla ice cream .
neutral|Fine . I will bring it right away .
neutral|Bruno Bistro , how may I help you ?
neutral|Yes , hello , I would like to make a reservation please .
neutral|Certainly sir , For which day and time please ?
neutral|Tonight at seven .
sadness|I'm sorry sir , but we are fully booked tonight until eight .
neutral|In that case , eight o'clock is fine .
neutral|Very well , and how many people will attend tonight ?
neutral|Four people .
neutral|Lastly , may I please know what name I should make the reservation under ?
neutral|Mark .
neutral|Would you please mail these letters , Lucy ?
neutral|Yes , Sir .
neutral|These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters .
neutral|All right , who should I send them to ?
neutral|It ’ s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London .
neutral|Ok , home or office address ?
neutral|Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive .
neutral|Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
neutral|Yes , it ’ s right .
neutral|Well , Randy , I'd say you've got a bad case of the flu . The main thing to do is get plenty of rest and drink lots of liquids . I'll prescribe something for that throat .
neutral|Thanks , doctor . Is there anything I can take for this headache ?
neutral|Some aspirin or Panadol should help . You can pick some up at the pharmacy when you go to fill your prescription .

neutral|OK . Please fill in this form and input you code here ... and again , please . I'll just check and see if the money has been transferred . Yes , transaction successful .
joy|Thank you very much .
neutral|Hello , Can I speak to Tom , please ?
sadness|I'm afraid he is not in at the moment .
neutral|May I ask what time he will come back ?
neutral|I think he will come back at 3 p . m . Do you want to call later ? Or would you like to leave a message for him ?
neutral|I'd like to leave a message . Please ask him to call me back as soon as he returns . I'm A and he has my number .
neutral|OK . I will do that .
joy|Thank you very much . Bye .
joy|You're welcome . Bye .
anger|Excuse me , I ’ Ve been waiting my main dish for quite a time .
neutral|Yes sir , just a minute , please . I ’ ll check with the kitchen . Thank you for waiting . It takes another 10 to 15 minutes , I ’ m afraid .
neutral|I have an appointment in half an hour .
neutral|I see .
neutral|Do you have anything else I can have instead ?
neutral|Well sir , yes . How about this stew ? We can serve you at once .
neutral|I ’ ll take this stew then .

neutral|No , tell him I'm tied up .
neutral|When should I tell him to call back ?
neutral|Tell him to call me tomorrow morning .
neutral|All right .
neutral|Thank you .
neutral|Now people are talking about world recession which started more than a year ago . Can you give us your personal assessment of the situation of the global economy ?
neutral|As you know , we are in a very special time . This is a very hard time for many countries ' economics , both developed and developing . I think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies .
neutral|What is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country's economy ?
neutral|Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world .
neutral|What challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment ?
neutral|We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption .
neutral|So , what do you plan to do today ?
neutral|There is a Matisse exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art . Larry and I will go .
neutral|Did you buy tickets already ?
neutral|No . Do we need tickets ?
neutral|Well , probably . Probably you will have to wait in line if you don't have tickets .
neutral|Outside or inside ?
neutral|Outside , on the sidewalk .
neutral|Hmm . It's very cold today.But I brought my jacket . Maybe it will be alright to wait .
neutral|The MYOMA is very popular . There will be a lot of people .
neutral|MYOMA ? What's that ?
neutral|Oh , sorry.It stands for the Museum of Modern Art . It's an acronym . M O M A MYOMA .
neutral|I see . Do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ?
neutral|I suggest you go to the Jewish Museum.It ' s not far from the Guggenheim , near Central Park . It is really very interesting.Also , there is a great museum of medieval European art further up north.It ' s called the Cloisters .
neutral|How can we get up there ?
neutral|You can take a bus .
neutral|But Larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous .
neutral|Finally we have a long holiday .
neutral|Yes , what about us having a tour ?
neutral|Good idea . Where shall we go ?
neutral|How about Milan ?
neutral|Great . Shall we go alone or as part of the group ?
neutral|Why not travel by ourselves ?
neutral|Hello . This is John ’ s Distribution . Can I help you ?
neutral|Yes . I need some ice water delivered .
neutral|Are you completely out ?
neutral|No , I have some , but not enough for the long weekend .
neutral|Okay . I ’ ll send someone to deliver it for you tomorrow .
joy|Thank you .
joy|No problem .
neutral|Please come in and sit down . I'm happy to finally meet you .
neutral|Same here . I've been looking forward to this .
neutral|I ’ m sorry I kept you waiting so long . I'm running a little late today .
neutral|No problem . That happens to all of us , it goes badly with the traffic .
neutral|Thank you . Can I offer you some refreshment ?
joy|Why not , thank you . A little tea would be nice .

neutral|Do you wash clothes here often ?
neutral|I have been coming here for the past few years .
neutral|Why do you wash here ?
neutral|It's actually a lot cheaper for me to wash my clothes here .
neutral|I've only washed my clothes here a couple times .
neutral|Why don't you wash clothes at home ?
neutral|I would , if my washing machine wasn't broken .
neutral|Why don't you just get it fixed ?
neutral|I can't afford it .
neutral|So you plan on washing your clothes here from now on ?
neutral|That's my only option right now .
neutral|Don't worry . Besides , it's a lot cheaper to wash clothes this way .
joy|Francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . In view of your achievement , I trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title .
joy|I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company .
joy|This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you .
joy|Thank you , I will be doing my best .
neutral|I've brought this dress back to exchange it .
neutral|That's not a problem . Leave it with me , and find something that you like .
neutral|I was hoping you'd have something on sale today .
neutral|We have nothing on sale today . But we're having a big sale next weekend .
neutral|Is the sale going to include dresses ?
neutral|Everything you can see will be on sale .
joy|I like the sound of that . I'll just come back next weekend .
joy|The savings will be worth the short wait . See you next weekend .
neutral|Good afternoon , sir.What Can I do for you ?
sadness|Well . I can't find my key now . I think I have lost it .
neutral|Really ? Have you left it in your room ?
neutral|I don't think so . I took it with me when I went out this morning .
neutral|Well , in that case , you have to pay for it . Please fill out the form first .
neutral|How are you today ?
neutral|Very well .
neutral|Do you need help with something ?
neutral|I need to make a transfer .
neutral|What account would you like to transfer the money from ?
neutral|I want to transfer money from my savings account .
neutral|Where do you want the money to go to ?
neutral|I want the money to be transferred into my checking account .
neutral|How much money are you going to transfer today ?
neutral|$ 200 will be fine .
neutral|Is that all I can do for you today ?
neutral|I won ’ t be needing anything else .

neutral|Yes . What is the rent ?
neutral|$ 300 per month .

neutral|When is a good time to catch him ?
neutral|In about twenty minutes .
neutral|Give me a book please , Jane .
neutral|Which book ? This one ?
neutral|No , not that one . The red one .

neutral|Yes , please .
neutral|Here you are .
joy|Thank you .
neutral|Do you want a shampoo ?
neutral|Yes .
neutral|What brand do you prefer ?
neutral|An ordinary one will do.Would you put me under a hot dryer after that ? I'm in a hurry .
neutral|All right , miss.This one is very hot . I'll come to turn it off in fifteen minutes.Will that be alright ?
neutral|OK .
surprise|Come on . Don ’ t cheat on me . It ’ s a long shot .
neutral|It ’ s true . You should be happy about that .
neutral|I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month .
neutral|It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax .
neutral|Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves .
neutral|Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
neutral|Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
neutral|What should I do to prepare for a job interview ?
neutral|An understanding of the basic workings of a company and the services or goods it provides is essential . Do you have that ?
neutral|Sort of , but I could know more , I guess .
neutral|With that understanding , you can figure out what your company is looking for in terms of basic attitude . Right ?
neutral|I think that they are a very formal company .
neutral|What you wear is important . So keep in mind what is suitable for the company and type of work you will be doing . Need help ?
neutral|I need a lot of help in this area .
neutral|In addition to clothes we need to think about other basics , OK ?
neutral|Yes , what else should we think of ?
joy|Be prompt . Don't forget to be friendly and interested . Listen carefully and listen to what they are really asking you . You'll be a hit !
neutral|What are your responsibilities as a secretary ?
neutral|I did only simple things in the office , such as tidying up the office , serving tea , typing and filing , and so on .
neutral|What courses did you take in English secretarial studies ?
neutral|I took such courses as Secretarial Principles , Office Administration , Business English , and Public Relations .
neutral|Hello . Where are you headed today ?
neutral|I'm off to Barcelona for a week .
neutral|Do you have your passport with you ?
neutral|Yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ?
neutral|Fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
neutral|That's good advice .
neutral|Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
neutral|Are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
neutral|Let me see here ... yes , there's one left .
neutral|Ok . I'll take that one then .
neutral|Alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
neutral|I like to travel light so I just have this one .
neutral|If that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
neutral|Yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ?
neutral|You're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight !
neutral|All right . I want to bring everybody in on this project . When can we start working on this ?
neutral|Well , we could probably get started with a strategy meeting tomorrow morning at 8
neutral|I tell you what , 800 is no good for me , but why don ’ t you guys get started and I ’ ll come by at around 8
neutral|That ’ s fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
neutral|I need a pan .
neutral|Okay . Do you have a particular size in mind ?
neutral|Well , the bigger the better , I think .
neutral|Look at this one . It's our biggest pan .
neutral|Yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me .
neutral|Okay , we have the same thing in aluminum .
neutral|Oh , this is nice and light . But it has an aluminum handle .
neutral|Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle .
joy|Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one .
joy|That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ?
neutral|Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too .
neutral|I'm so sorry . A lid comes with the pan . Here it is .
neutral|Well , Mr . Smith . That ’ s a nasty infection you have .
neutral|Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , Doctor ?
neutral|I ’ m going to prescribe some antibiotics , and some cream to ease the itching and burning .
neutral|OK . Thank you . Where should I buy them ?
neutral|The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .
neutral|Great . What floor is the pharmacy on ?
neutral|The fourth . I ’ ll send the prescription down there , so you can just pick it up on your way out .
neutral|Thank you .
neutral|Our factory locates at a village in the east of the city . The area of it is 3,600 square meters .
neutral|We'd like to visit the factory . Can you show me the way ?
neutral|That's OK ! We'll take you to have a tour . Please follow me .
neutral|How many shifts are there in your factory ?
neutral|There are two shifts now in total .
neutral|What about your company's QC management ?
neutral|We established the strict QC standards and we have followed it for about five years with good results .
neutral|Where are the workers from ? From the villages nearby ?
neutral|Most of them live in the city . We provide free commuter buses for the workers . Besides , we built the dormitory building for the workers on night shift .
joy|It sounds nice . We can't wait to visiting the factory .
neutral|My toothache started nearly a month ago . The pain's been keeping me awake . Would you please have a look ?
neutral|Open your mouth , please . Which one ?
neutral|The one right at the back .
neutral|I'm afraid we can ’ t save that one . It will have to come out .
neutral|Will it hurt much ?
neutral|I'll give you an injection , then you won't feel pain .
neutral|( 5 minutes later ) OK , it's all over . Spit there and bite the cotton ball tightly in place for half an hour .
neutral|It's raining heavily .
neutral|We have to find a shelter .
neutral|All right .
neutral|Let's go under the tree .
neutral|No , we can't . It's thundering .
neutral|Then let's go to that store .
neutral|Hi , I want to check out . Here is my room key .
neutral|One second , sir , while I print out your receipt . Here you are .
neutral|Thanks .
neutral|May I ask , sir , if you enjoyed your stay ?
neutral|Well , except for one night , I enjoyed the hotel . And I loved New York , of course .
neutral|Thank you for your honesty . I assure you there will be no cockroaches next time .
neutral|Have you attended school today ?
neutral|I attended school today . Did you ?
neutral|I wasn't able to attend school because I was feeling ill .
neutral|I'm sorry to hear that . Would you like the assignments from English class ?
joy|I would really appreciate that , thanks .
neutral|It's no trouble at all .
neutral|If you get sick , I'll return the favor .
neutral|Thanks . See you at school tomorrow if you feel better .
neutral|Well , if you have no further questions , then we have done .
neutral|Thank you , Mr . Owens , for taking time out of your busy schedule to interview me .
neutral|You ’ re welcome . I appreciate your coming .
neutral|When can I contact you about your final decision ?
neutral|We need to consider several other applicants and we hope to make a decision by the end of this month . We will call you regardless of whether you are hired or not .
neutral|Thanks a lot ! I will look forward to the good news . Please call me at this number between nine and eleven in the morning .
neutral|Well , I really appreciate your coming today .
neutral|The pleasure is mine . It ’ s nice talking with you . Good-bye , Mr . Owens .
neutral|Good-bye .
neutral|Tom . Please do not disturb me for the next hour .
neutral|Are you having a meeting ?
neutral|Yes , and I don't want to be interrupted .
neutral|I understand .
neutral|Well , Mr . Smith . That's a nasty infection you have .
neutral|Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , doctor ?
neutral|I'm going to prescribe some antibiotics and some cream to ease the itching and burning .
neutral|Ok , thank you ! Where should I buy them ?
neutral|The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .
neutral|Great ! What floor is pharmacy on ?
neutral|The fourth . I'll send the prescription down there so you can just pick it up on your way out .
neutral|Thank you !
neutral|How can I help you ?
neutral|well , I'm looking for some summer clothes .
neutral|Oh , it is the right time for you purchasing in our clothes shop . We are now having a low price on all our summer apparel .
neutral|Really ? What's that ?
neutral|Everything for summer is 20 % off .
neutral|I like this T-shirt . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with it ?
joy|Sure . We have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the T-shirt . Look at this section .
joy|This one is good .
joy|You have good taste . It is very much in style this year .
neutral|I'll take this one . How much are they ?
neutral|160 yuan .
neutral|Here you are .
neutral|What are you having for lunch ?
neutral|I got a sandwich , some chips , and a soda .
neutral|Did you bring that from home ?
neutral|I got it from the cafeteria .
neutral|What kind of sandwich did you get ?
neutral|They messed up my order and gave me a bologna sandwich .
neutral|How was it ?
neutral|Considering it wasn't what I ordered , it was still pretty good .
neutral|I think I got a sandwich there once before .
surprise|Really ?
neutral|Yes , and they didn't get my order right either .
neutral|Could you project what you would like to be doing five years from now ?
neutral|As I have some administrative experience from my last job , I may use my organizational and planning skills in the future .
neutral|How do you plan to accomplish this ?
neutral|By doing everything necessary and for further study .
neutral|How long would you like to stay with this company ?
neutral|How long I will stay with the company depends on whether the company and I are satisfied with each other .
neutral|What do you think of this industry's outlook in five years ?
neutral|I do believe this industry will be developed rapidly in 5 years time .
neutral|Hello ? This is John Smith.Can I speak to Mr.White , please ?
neutral|This is Mr.White speaking .
neutral|Hi . I understand that you have a house for sale , haven ’ t you ?

joy|Thank you for calling.Goodbye .
joy|Bye .
neutral|Hey , Jim , you're 15 minutes late . What's up ?
neutral|I got stuck in a traffic jam .
neutral|Hurry up , the show is about to start .
neutral|It looks like you're very interested in the circus .
neutral|Yes , I love to see the animal show .
neutral|I have never seen those before , but since you're so excited it should be good .
neutral|I'm sure you'll love it .
neutral|Okay , I will go and get some popcorn first .
neutral|May I have a cookie ?
neutral|Help yourself .
neutral|What's the matter ?
neutral|Checking out , please .
neutral|Can I have your keys , please ? Thank you . Here's your statement .
neutral|Excuse me . What are these charges ?
neutral|Oh , these are the phone charges and these are for something from the bar .
neutral|Wait a minute . I made a phone call , but I never made a connection .
neutral|I know , sir . Those aren't telephone company charges . Those are hotel charges .
anger|Isn't that a bit excessive ?
neutral|I'm sorry , sir . It's our policy .
neutral|OK . Here is the money .
neutral|Thank you . Welcome to our hotel again .
neutral|Can I help you , sir ?
neutral|Yes , I'd like to look at some suits .
neutral|Oh , this way please . What size do you wear ?
neutral|Size 41 . I want something in dark flannel .
neutral|How about this one ?
neutral|It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better . This seems too light for winter . Do you think you could get me one ?
neutral|All right . I'll show you something darker . Do you like this one ?
neutral|It looks good . But can I try it on ?
neutral|Of course . Let me help you .
joy|Thanks . It's comfortable . Well , how much is it , please ?
neutral|$ 280 .
joy|Ok . I'll take it . Here's the money .
neutral|Mike , you're seventeen years old , right ?
neutral|Yeah , Why ?
neutral|You look quite mature beside your cousin who is eighteen .
neutral|You can bet on that .
neutral|Come in and sit down .
neutral|Thanks , Mr . Liang .
neutral|Among all the assistants , I think you're on top of it . Based on the annual evaluation , the board of directors decided to give you a bonus .
joy|Really ? I am too happy .
neutral|I've been reviewing your work over the past few months . Thanks to your excellent work , we benefit much from your project . And you should get the perfect attendance award too .
joy|Thanks for your trust . Owing to my colleagues ' help , I've successfully completed my task .
neutral|You are very modest and diligent . The distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation . You deserve it .
joy|Thank you very much . I will redouble my efforts in the future .
neutral|Donna ! How are you ? It's good to hear your voice .
neutral|Thank you . Jack , it's always a pleasure doing business with you .
neutral|So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ?
neutral|Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ?
joy|Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR .
joy|Oh.Jack , I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift .
neutral|Or a curse .
neutral|Nope , it's a gift.Anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time .
neutral|That , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional .
neutral|Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ?
neutral|Heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , I'll let you have'em at 50 off .
neutral|You silver-tongued devil . Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ?
neutral|I could , but where's the fun in that ?
neutral|Hi . I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ?
neutral|So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case .
neutral|Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ?
neutral|I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ?
neutral|What seems to be the problem ?
neutral|It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry .
neutral|Umm ... You know ... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline . No need to hold my seat .
neutral|I need to go to the ATM .
neutral|So , why don ’ t you ?
neutral|I have no idea how to use the ATM .
neutral|What do you mean ?
neutral|This will be my first time using an ATM .
neutral|I can help you with that .
neutral|Explain to me how to use it .
neutral|Just put your card into the machine .
neutral|Now what do I do ?
neutral|Then you need to type in your PIN .
neutral|Now what ?
neutral|Just click on one of the choices they give you , and that ’ s it .
neutral|Would you like something to drink ?
neutral|Yes please . Do you have any teas ?
neutral|Of course we have lots of teas ?
neutral|What do you recommend ?
neutral|What about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea ?
neutral|What ’ s this one ?
neutral|That ’ s Oolong tea – it ’ s a Cantonese tea .
neutral|Ok , I ’ ll try that .
neutral|May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ?
surprise|Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing !
neutral|Why are they all in glass boxes ?
neutral|For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .
neutral|So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?
neutral|No , there isn't . They are all vacuumed .
neutral|I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ?
neutral|Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .
neutral|Hey , look at the three-leg cup . I've seen it on TV .
surprise|The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !
neutral|Yeah , it has no value at all . Who will use this cup today ?
neutral|Danny , priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it .
neutral|Oh , it does ?
fear|I am so worried about this English contest . I have butterflies in my stomach now !
neutral|I have confidence in you . Believe in yourself .
neutral|What would you like on your pizzas ?
neutral|We want one vegetarian supreme and one double pepperoni .
neutral|Would you like anything to drink with that ? For $ 1.50 , you can get a two-liter bottle of Coke .
neutral|No , thanks .
neutral|All right . That'll be $ 12.50 . Your pizzas will be there in 30 minutes .
joy|Thanks .
neutral|We are redecorating and I'm going to add some things .
neutral|Well , I'll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office .
neutral|Shall we meet at 1:15 this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
neutral|Fine , I'll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday .
neutral|Can you tell me the way to library ?
neutral|Sure , turn left at the next crossing .
neutral|Is it on Xinhua street ?
neutral|Yes . You can't miss it .
neutral|Comfort Inn , may I help you ?
neutral|I ’ m looking for a hotel near the convention center .
neutral|You ’ re in luck ! We ’ re just a two-minute drive from there . Would you like to make a reservation ?
neutral|Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ?
neutral|During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ’ Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now – only $ 30 a night . And we ’ Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in
neutral|That ’ s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients .
neutral|Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking
neutral|That sounds great . Do you accept checks ?
neutral|I ’ m sorry , sir , we don ’ t . But we do accept all major credit cards .
neutral|I am sorry to trouble you , but there's a lot of noise in the next room .
neutral|Oh , is there ? Which room is it ?
neutral|It's . I think , neighbours on the right .
neutral|You mean the room thirteen-thirteen ?
neutral|I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhausted , but I can't sleep .
neutral|All right , ma'am . I'll check and tell them to be quiet .
neutral|If next room is still noisy , could you give me a different room , please ?
neutral|Have you ever been to Xi ’ an ?
neutral|Yes , I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city .
neutral|I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place .
neutral|I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening .
neutral|Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ?
neutral|Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train .
neutral|A ticket to London , please .
neutral|A cheap day return ticket ?
neutral|Yes , including London Tube .
neutral|That'll be twelve pounds .
neutral|Doctor , what is the best way to stay healthy ?
neutral|Having a good diet is probably the most important thing .
neutral|It is very confusing to know what to eat .
neutral|You need plenty of fruits and vegetables , small amounts of protein , and whole grains .
neutral|Are there certain things that I should avoid ?
neutral|You shouldn ’ t consume too much sugar or caffeine . Also , watch your intake of fatty food .
neutral|After watching my diet , what else should I do ?
neutral|You need to stop smoking , and make sure that you get 30 minutes of exercise every day .
neutral|Can I have a glass of wine now and then ?
neutral|As long as you don ’ t overdo it , a glass of wine a day should be OK .
neutral|Darling , I am back . What are you doing ?
neutral|I am washing clothes . Are you hungry now ? Wait for a moment , I'll cook dinner for you . ( Steven bends his brows )
neutral|B , should we get a maid ?
neutral|I can do all the housework . We don't need a maid .
neutral|You have worked very hard in the office . If we can get someone to help you , you can have more rest .
neutral|We really don't need to .
neutral|You are a good wife , Julia . But you must take care of yourself .
neutral|Give me some time to think about it .
neutral|Can I reserve a room from the 13th to the 18th ?
neutral|Certainly . How do you like your room ?
neutral|I'd like a suite . What's the rate ?
neutral|$ 40 per night .
neutral|Is there anything I can do for you ?
neutral|Excuse me , can I change my order ? I am afraid I don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner .
sadness|I am sorry , sir . Your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it .
neutral|That's all right .
neutral|Have you graduated now ?
neutral|Yes . I graduated this past June .
neutral|Which university did you graduate from ?
neutral|Guangzhou University .
neutral|What degree did you receive ?
neutral|I received a bachelor's degree in Economics .
neutral|What courses did you take in college ?
neutral|My major courses were Microeconomics , Macroeconomics , International Trade , International Finance , World Economy , Psychology and Business English
neutral|Why did you choose to study Economics ?
neutral|Because I was quite interested in Economics then .
neutral|Can you speak other languages except English ?
neutral|I can also speak a little Japanese .
joy|I am very satisfied with your answers .
joy|Thank you very much .
neutral|Once you arrive at the American airport , please call me .
neutral|OK , don ’ t worry about it . I will .
neutral|Take care of yourself .
neutral|Sorry , Mary , I can't make it in time for dinner .
neutral|Okay , Bob , when will I see you ?
neutral|Maybe I will be around later .
neutral|Okay , I'll see you later .
sadness|I am sorry , sir . I have broken the reading lamp in my room .
neutral|Well , sir . May I have your room number ?
neutral|503 . I would like to pay for it .
neutral|Please fill out the form first .
neutral|OK , can you bring me a new one ?
neutral|Of course .
neutral|Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription .
neutral|It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
neutral|Yes , I need to refill it today .
neutral|Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice .
neutral|I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not .
neutral|Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
neutral|Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ?
neutral|I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out .
neutral|But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription .
neutral|Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never .
neutral|But I have a prescription . I just need more of it .
neutral|A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
neutral|Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
neutral|Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry .
anger|This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .
neutral|Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .
neutral|What are you doing ?
neutral|I ’ m trying to put the vase on the shelf .
neutral|Let regive you a hand .
neutral|No , thank you . I can manage it , I think .
neutral|There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose .
neutral|Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
neutral|I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound .
neutral|Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
neutral|That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .
neutral|Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .
neutral|Ahhchooo !
neutral|You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ?
neutral|No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies .
neutral|I never have seasonal allergies .
neutral|Consider yourself lucky .
neutral|What are all the symptoms ?
neutral|Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .
neutral|That doesn't sound good .
neutral|No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?
neutral|Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family .
neutral|Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .
neutral|I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body .
neutral|That's pretty bad .
joy|But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah .
neutral|Let's have a look at the map first .
neutral|All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .
neutral|Let's buy some tickets .
neutral|The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train
neutral|Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?
neutral|No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them .
neutral|What do you do ?
neutral|I'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . My training lasts for two years . Two days a week I study Engineering at a local college . If I pass all my exams , I hope the company will take me on as an engineer .
neutral|I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ?
neutral|Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day .
neutral|Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then .
neutral|What about cats ? They are more independent .
neutral|Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .
neutral|How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?
neutral|Yeah , are they easy to look after ?
neutral|Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .
neutral|Can I be of any service to you ?
neutral|I've been told that Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . We'd like to take some home . What would you recommend ?
neutral|There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop.For example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few.Do you have anything in mind ?
neutral|No , not really.But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry .
neutral|I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.They are very easy to carry .
neutral|So , we'd like to see some embroidery .
neutral|Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ?
neutral|I had some bread for breakfast .
neutral|Let's go out for brunch .
neutral|Brunch ?
neutral|It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also .
neutral|Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch .
neutral|Hi , my name is Sovia.What ’ s your name ?
neutral|My name is Jeff .
neutral|What do you do ?
neutral|I ’ m a podiatrist . What about you ?
neutral|I ’ m a nurse.What do you do in your free time ?
neutral|I like to play piano , go bowling and chat with my friends.And you ?
neutral|I like to hang out with my friends , play games and go swimming .
neutral|Would you like to go out some time ?
joy|Sure , that ’ d be great.Where would you like to go ?
neutral|Anywhere with you .
joy|Aren ’ t you sweet .
neutral|Oh , I'm starving . I'd like to try some real Chinese cuisine . What would you recommend , waiter ?
neutral|Well , it depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese for instance , the Sichuan cuisine , and the Hunan cuisine .
neutral|They are both spicy hot , I've heard .
neutral|That's right . If you like hot dishes , you could try some .
neutral|They might be too hot for me .
neutral|Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine . Most southerners like them .
neutral|What about any special Beijing dishes ?
neutral|There's the Beijing roast duck .
neutral|Oh , yes . I've heard a lot about it . I'd like very much to try it . Where can I find it ?
neutral|You can find it in most restaurants , but the best place is certainly Quanjude Restaurant .
neutral|Is it near here ?
neutral|Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in 15 minutes , If the traffic is not too bad , I mean .
neutral|Well , thank you for your information . But what is the name of that restaurant again ?
neutral|Let me write it down on this slip of paper for you . You can show it to the taxi-driver .
joy|That's very kind of you . Thanks a lot .
neutral|hi , Isaiah . How are you ?
neutral|I ’ m well . And you ?
neutral|fine . How ’ s your job going ?
neutral|I don ’ t know if I told you or not , but I decided to start my own business .
surprise|really ? That ’ s fantastic . What kind of business is it ?
neutral|I ’ Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs .
neutral|how ’ s it going ?
joy|it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming !
joy|that ’ s such great news . I ’ m really happy for you ! Where is your office located ?
neutral|our headoffice is here in Beijing , but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon .
neutral|where will those be located ?
neutral|if all goes well , we ’ ll open one up in Hong Kong in April and another one in Singapore in October .
neutral|when will you find out ?
neutral|we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow .
joy|well , good luck . I hope it all goes well for you tomorrow !
joy|thanks !
neutral|Ant Shirley , it's being years since we last met . How were you doing in the passing years ?
joy|Pretty well . What about you ?
neutral|Fine . Where are the other guys ?
neutral|It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie .
neutral|Bad timing . I want to see them so much . How are they ?
neutral|Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ?
neutral|Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment .
neutral|Did you go to a real estate agent ?
neutral|No , that will be too expensive .
neutral|That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ?
neutral|My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford .
joy|Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you .
joy|I'll appreciate it so much .
neutral|Good afternoon .
neutral|My goodness ! It ’ s the afternoon ? Doesn ’ t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down .
joy|Thank you .
neutral|What ’ s the time ? My watch has stopped .
neutral|It ’ s half past twelve .
neutral|When do you have lunch ?
neutral|From one to two .
neutral|What do you normally eat ?
neutral|We usually go to the cafeteria .
neutral|Oh , it ’ s time to have lunch now .
neutral|let ’ s go together .
neutral|Merry Christmas , Bill .
neutral|Merry Christmas , Jina .
neutral|What are you doing there on the computer ?
joy|Come have a look , I received many beautiful e-cards . They are from my friends , all over the world . Christmas wishes for all my friends .
neutral|That's pretty interesting . Did you get one from Haven ? The reason I ask is that I am looking for her number .
neutral|Sorry , I don't have it . But I do have her Email . You want me to sent it to you ?
joy|Yeah , that would be great . Thanks .
neutral|No worries . I just for her card . And you can get her from Email . I would really like to talk to her again . I kind of miss her a little this days .
joy|Thanks million .
joy|My pleasure .
neutral|There are so many eating utensils on the table . Which ones do I use first ?
neutral|Use them from the outside in .
neutral|I see . A set for appetizers and another for the main course .
neutral|Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ?
neutral|Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap .
neutral|Let's look at our menus .
neutral|Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking .
neutral|Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees .
neutral|It was nice talking to you .
anger|Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ?
neutral|I really have to go .
anger|Why ? I still wanted to talk to you .
neutral|I have things to do .
neutral|Like what ?
anger|Don't be nosey .
neutral|I'm not . I just want to know .
neutral|Well , it's really none of your business .
anger|That's harsh .
neutral|I'm sorry , but I have to go .
neutral|Fine .
neutral|Mom , will you have time to help me with my homework today ?
sadness|Sorry , I won't . I'll be working against the clock to finish my presentation .
neutral|Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won ’ t you ?
neutral|Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ?
neutral|Of course , you have . You must try harder this time .
neutral|And must I go back to school ?
neutral|No , you needn ’ t do that . You ’ d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .
neutral|But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ’ m nearly 17 .
neutral|You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .
neutral|What else I ’ Ve got to do ? Join the army ?
neutral|Who knows ! That might come to later .
neutral|How do you do ?
neutral|How do you do ?
neutral|My name is Wang Liang , I ’ m from Beijing . Where do you come from ?
neutral|I come from the city of Tangshan in Hebes Province .
surprise|You're from Tangshan ? I can't believe my ears . I was also born in Tangshan , but I was brought up in Beijing .
surprise|Really ? It's nice to meet you . How long have you been with this company ?
neutral|Just over 4 years now . Since this is your first day here , I'm sure you don't really know too much yet . Let me show you around , so you can introduce yourself to everyone .
joy|Oh , Thank you very much !
neutral|Hello , Parker . How's everything ?
neutral|Can't complain . And you ?
neutral|Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How's your schedule look ?
neutral|Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday .
joy|Great .
neutral|I like to open up a savings account please .
neutral|O . K . We offer a few different kinds .
neutral|I want the one with the highest interest rate .
neutral|That would be our Saver's Plus account .
neutral|4.5 % , that's good . How much money do I have to keep in it to get that rate ?
neutral|You have to maintain a balance of $ 10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 % .
neutral|All right . I ’ ll open one of those .
neutral|Just fill out these forms , and I ’ ll be with you in one second .
neutral|Thanks .
neutral|Hi , where can I find a cheap cashmere sweater ?
neutral|How about an outlet ?
joy|Great idea !
neutral|Outlets give good deals .
joy|Thank you so much .
joy|You're welcome .
neutral|I have difficulty with this form . Will you please explain it to me ?
neutral|Actually there is a sample over there . But if you still have a problem , let me know .
joy|Oh , that's great . Thank you very much .
neutral|Do you develop films here ?
neutral|Yes , we shall . What size do you like ?
neutral|Well , the 4 x 6 is fine .
neutral|Which do you prefer , color or black and white ?
neutral|The last one is black and white , all the rest should need color .
neutral|OK .
neutral|I hope they will come out well . When should I pick them up ?
neutral|They will be ready at noon tomorrow . Each negative develops one print , right ?
neutral|Yes , it is . And develop them as glossy as possible .
neutral|No problem . Do you need another film ?
neutral|Yes , a roll of Kodak film please .
neutral|It is totally $ 20 including the deposit for films .
neutral|How come it is slow as a snail today ?
neutral|You mean the network connection ?
neutral|Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response for any click .
neutral|I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately .
neutral|Ok .
neutral|I need help . I think my arm is broken .
neutral|Alright . Have you been to this hospital before ?
neutral|No , I haven't . I need help quick . It hurts really badly .
neutral|I understand . It's good you came to the emergency room .
neutral|Let me see a doctor .
neutral|I'm sorry , sir . You will need to wait at least a short time.We are very busy tonight . There was a big car accident on Highway 106 .
neutral|I thought this was the emergency room .
neutral|It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding , are you ?
neutral|No . Only a little . I fell off my porch .
neutral|Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ?
neutral|My left arm .
neutral|Can you fill out this form then ?
neutral|No , I can't . I'm left-handed .
neutral|That's very inconvenient for you then.You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm .
neutral|Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room .
neutral|Yes , it is . But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.Have you ever been in an emergency room before ?
neutral|No . Just let me see a doctor . I'm worried about my arm .
neutral|Be brave , sir . It won't be long . I will fill out the form for you . What is your name ?
neutral|Steve Schliessman . S C H L I E S S M A N .
neutral|Alright Steve . Your social security number ?
neutral|349-95- 8821 .
neutral|Do you have medical insurance ?
neutral|Yes , I do . Blue Cross .
neutral|Do you have your insurance card with you ?
neutral|No , I don't .
neutral|Well , you can call it in later . You can phone us .
neutral|Can I sit down now ?
neutral|First I need to get your address . Try to move your arm as little as possible .
joy|Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice .
joy|Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet .
neutral|Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ?
neutral|This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee !
joy|That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ?
neutral|No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
neutral|So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?
neutral|I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs .
neutral|I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a
joy|It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I took recently ?
neutral|What shall we do today ?
neutral|We'd better stay in the hotel , because the tour will begin tomorrow .
neutral|Let's go out for some exercise , shall we ?
joy|What an excellent idea !
neutral|Shall we do some jogging ?
neutral|OK .
joy|I feel well now .
neutral|Yes , some exercise is necessary for us .
neutral|Quite right .
neutral|I was wondering if you need any help on your new project .
neutral|Sure ! That would be great ! Are you good at writing or would you rather do the computer work ?
neutral|I would like to help with the computer work .
neutral|Great ! We are going to be working in teams of three . Are you OK working with others ?
neutral|Yes , I like working like that .
neutral|We will begin next Monday . Would you be available then ?
neutral|Yes , I can be there .
neutral|Well , if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday , it would be useful .
neutral|OK , I will send the information to you .
neutral|Well then , thanks for your help . Have a great day !
joy|Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion .
joy|Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it .
neutral|I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ?
neutral|Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful .
neutral|How do you think if I volunteer for some work ?
neutral|I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives .
neutral|Taxi !
neutral|Yes , sir . Where to ?
neutral|The city square , please .
neutral|Are you in a hurry ?
neutral|Yes , I have to be there to meet a friend at 5 thirty pm . So we're sure we can get there on time ?
sadness|I'm afraid not , sir . Generally we can , but you know how it is in the rush hour now .
neutral|I see . Here's the extra 5 $ for you if you can get me there on time .
neutral|All right . I'll do my best .
neutral|Oh.we made it . Thank you . How much do I own you ?
neutral|The reading on the kilometer is 12 $ .
neutral|Here's the money , keep the changes , please .
neutral|Do you need a receipt ?
joy|No , thank you .
neutral|Janice , I can't find the document I was working on last month . Can you help me to look for it ?
neutral|Susan , I'm sorry . Did you look up those files I requested ?
neutral|Yes , but I still can not find it . Maybe it is in this cabinet .
neutral|I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there .
neutral|I am sure that document was filed .
neutral|Well , let me check again under a different heading .
neutral|Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files .
neutral|Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' .
neutral|What would you have ?
neutral|I'll try Chinese wine .
neutral|What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head .
joy|OK . Give me one , please .
joy|Here it is .
joy|Thank you .
joy|I'm always at your service .
neutral|Are you planning on voting ?
neutral|Yes . Are you ?
neutral|I will be voting tomorrow .
neutral|What ’ s your polling place ?
neutral|My polling place is at the park up the street .
neutral|Oh , yeah ?
neutral|Yeah , where is yours ?
neutral|I don ’ t know .
surprise|How is it you don ’ t know ?
neutral|The location of my polling place never came in the mail .
neutral|You can always just check online .
neutral|Let me go do that .
neutral|I am sorry , I have broken my wine glass , and would you please bring me another ?
neutral|Sure . I will clean the glasses for you .
joy|Thank you . Where is the washing room ?
neutral|Walk straight and turn left .
neutral|What's wrong , officer ?
neutral|You do realize that you ran a red light , don't you ?
surprise|I did ?
neutral|You didn't see the red light ?
sadness|I'm sorry for running it , but I really didn't know .
neutral|Didn't you learn that red means stop ?
neutral|I know that .
neutral|Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light .
neutral|I'm not sure .
neutral|I'm giving you a ticket for this .
sadness|I'm sorry for the misunderstanding .
neutral|Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light .
neutral|Medicine Industry , this is Peter Bush speaking , can I help you ?
neutral|Good afternoon , could you connect this call with Mr Brown , please
neutral|May I know who's calling ?
neutral|This is Li Ping of ABC computer company limited . I'm calling on our Mr Wilson the general manager of our company .
neutral|I'm sorry , Mrs Li , Mr Brown is now in a meeting.May I have your number , and ask him to call you back later ?
neutral|I'm afraid Mr Wilson would like to speak to Mr Brown right now.He ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with Mr Brown without delay .
neutral|Ok , then would you please hold the line ? Mr Li , the line is through , Mr Brown is ready answering the call , go ahead .
neutral|Thank you for your assistance , Mr Bush .
neutral|You are welcome .
neutral|Mr . Li , I come to remind you of the meeting scheduled at 11 o'clock this morning .
neutral|Oh , that's right . And the general manager asked me to report the company's sales for last year at the meeting .
neutral|By the way , the meeting will be held in your office .
joy|OK , thank you very much .
neutral|Not at all . That's what I should do .
neutral|Bob , would you come and help me ?
neutral|Of course . What do you want me to do , Mom ?
neutral|Could you hold these packages while I look for the key ?
neutral|Alright , what's in them ? They are so heavy !
neutral|Just things we need for the picnic tomorrow .
neutral|Well , hurry up and open the door please . I told you these things are heavy .
sadness|I'm sorry , but I just can't find the key . You must have it .
neutral|Oh , yes , it's in my pocket . But how can I get the key while I'm holding all these bags ?
neutral|Excuse me . My name is Dan Ford . I have an appointment with the dentist at 3:30 .
neutral|Yes , Mr . Ford . The dentist will be ready to see you in a minute . Have a seat .
neutral|Thank you .
neutral|Isn't it past your bedtime already ?
neutral|I am not sleepy .
neutral|It's getting late , and you have to wake up early tomorrow .
neutral|There is no way that I can fall asleep right now .
neutral|Try listening to some soft music .
neutral|It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired .
neutral|I really don't care , just go to sleep .
neutral|What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ?
neutral|You'll be up all night if I let you do that .
neutral|I'm going to get to sleep eventually .
neutral|You need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep .
neutral|Good night .
neutral|I want to go try on these clothes .
neutral|What did you find ?
neutral|I found some jeans , and a new blouse .
neutral|Go and try it on .
neutral|What do you think ?
neutral|I love that shirt on you .
neutral|What about the jeans ?
neutral|They don't really fit you right .
neutral|I don't think so either .
neutral|That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though .
neutral|Well , I'll just buy the shirt .
joy|That would be a good idea .
neutral|Now , Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I ’ Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I ’ m quite impressed .
neutral|Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear . If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me .
neutral|Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
neutral|Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around sixteen .
neutral|Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ?
neutral|Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too .
neutral|Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
neutral|Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down .
neutral|I see . okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
neutral|Can you tell me , Ms . Smith , about the training programs you initiated this year ?
neutral|We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained .
neutral|What ’ s the result ?
neutral|We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received .
joy|That seems very impressive . Good work !
joy|Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level .
neutral|Well , good morning , Tom . I haven't seen you for a long time .
sadness|I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago .
neutral|What seems to be the trouble now ?
neutral|I feel run down , tired . I've been having headaches almost every day . And I'm not getting as much sleep as usually do .
neutral|Have you been eating properly ? Eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know .
sadness|Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch .
neutral|And what about dinner ?
neutral|Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all .
neutral|That's not good . You don't have a well-balanced diet . Have you been taking vitamin pills ?
neutral|I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first .
joy|Thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us .
joy|No , thank you .
neutral|Would you like us to deliver the mattress for you , sir ?
joy|That would be great .
neutral|When do you want it delivered ?
neutral|I need it delivered tomorrow . Will that be possible ?
neutral|What time exactly ?
neutral|I need it delivered at 12 o'clock .
neutral|We can have it to you at that time .
neutral|That's not a problem ?
neutral|We will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock .
joy|That's great ! Thank you very much .
neutral|Can I help you ?
neutral|Yes , I'm looking for a house .
neutral|To buy or to rent ?
neutral|Oh , to rent .
neutral|How much do you want to pay ?
neutral|About 300 a month .
neutral|Well , I've got one here . It's 260 a month .
neutral|How big is it ?
neutral|It's got a kitchen , a bathroom , and one bedroom .
neutral|Well , actually I prefer something a bit bigger if that's possible .
neutral|Yes , I think so . There is also an interesting one.It ' s opposite the park .
neutral|How much is it ?
neutral|It's 325 a month . It's the biggest we've got in this area .
neutral|What's it like ?
neutral|Well , There're two bedrooms , a sitting room , a kitchen and a bathroom .
joy|It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ?
neutral|Of course , Sir .
neutral|Would you please mail these letters , Lucy ?
neutral|Yes , Sir .
neutral|These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters .
neutral|All right , who should I send them to ?
neutral|It ’ s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London .
neutral|Ok , home or office address ?
neutral|Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive .
neutral|Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
neutral|Yes , it ’ s right .
neutral|What are you reading ?
neutral|Oh , it ’ s the latest novel by Ray Blue . It ’ s a sic-fi thriller .
surprise|I thought he usually wrote horror books .
neutral|He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read .
neutral|We ’ re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ?
neutral|Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks .
neutral|Me too . I need something to read on the flight to New York . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter .
neutral|I want to look at nelson Mandela ’ s autobiography .
neutral|This is sure to be a worthwhile read .
sadness|Doctor , I have the worst toothache !
neutral|How long have you had this pain ?
neutral|For about a week or so , but it ’ s gotten really bad in the last couple of days .
neutral|Did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth ?
neutral|You know , I was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day , and I accidentally bit down really hard on one .
neutral|What kind of toothbrush do you use ?
neutral|I just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush .
neutral|Does it bother you when you eat something really cold ?
neutral|Yes , it definitely bothers me more when I do that .
neutral|Good evening .
neutral|Good evening.My wife and I would like a room , please.Is there any room available ? We don't have a reservation .
neutral|Let me see.Yes , we have one room left.You ' re lucky.It ' s the last one .
neutral|Good.We ' re tired after driving all day , and we're looking forward to relaxing in a comfortable room .
neutral|This room has two double beds.It ' s number 56 at the rear of the motel.It ' s quite a comfortable room .
neutral|How much is it for one night ? We only need it for tonight.We ' re going to continue our trip in the morning .
neutral|It's forty-five dollars a night for two.Is anyone else traveling with you ?
neutral|No , it's just the two of us .
neutral|Would you like to pay for the room in cash or with a credit card ?

neutral|Thank you very much .
neutral|Thank you , sir.Enjoy your stay with us .
neutral|Let's go to the animal shelter .
neutral|What do you want to do ?
neutral|I want to get a puppy for my son .
neutral|That will make him so happy .
neutral|I'll get him one of those little dogs .
neutral|One that won't grow up too big .
neutral|And eat too much .
neutral|Do you know which one he would like ?
neutral|Oh , yes , I took him there yesterday . He showed me one that he really liked .
neutral|I bet you had to drag him away .
neutral|He wanted to take it home yesterday .
neutral|I wonder what he'll name it .
neutral|Hello . I want to send the computer to my sister in Shanghai by logistics transport .
neutral|OK . Is it in the box ? May I see it ?
neutral|Yes . This is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor .
neutral|Is there anything else ?
neutral|There are a mouse and a camera .
neutral|Is that all ?
neutral|Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ?
neutral|It depends on the weight of these things . Generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram .
neutral|I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ?
neutral|Please go over there to weigh them .
neutral|OK . See you later .
surprise|what happened ? Why didn't he win ?
neutral|didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .
surprise|how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
neutral|if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
surprise|what ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
neutral|he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
neutral|I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
neutral|they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
neutral|that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
neutral|I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
neutral|regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
neutral|I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
neutral|let's hope so .
neutral|I need to use the ATM .
neutral|What ’ s stopping you ?
neutral|I ’ m not sure how .
neutral|I don ’ t understand .
neutral|I ’ Ve never used one before .
neutral|I can help you figure it out .
neutral|What do I have to do ?
neutral|Slide your card into the machine .
neutral|Then what ?
neutral|You need to type your PIN in .
neutral|What do I have to do next ?
neutral|Click on whichever option you want , and you ’ re done .
neutral|What are you doing ? Checking the " to do " list for the wedding ?
neutral|Yep . There's still so much to do !
neutral|So let's start by checking off what we've already done .
neutral|Did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the Taiwanese guests ?
neutral|Not yet , I was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the Net .
joy|Cool ! I can't believe he agreed to go all the way to Dallas with us !
neutral|Hey ! We're paying for his ticket !
neutral|It is my first time coming to China . I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts .
joy|We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ?
neutral|Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them .
joy|You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?
joy|Sounds good . May I have a look ?
joy|Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .
neutral|They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs .
joy|All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .
neutral|Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ?
neutral|This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac .
neutral|Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones .
joy|OK , I will wrap them for you .
neutral|Can you make out what he's saying ?
neutral|No , it's too loud in here .
neutral|Excuse me .
neutral|Yes ?
neutral|Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ?
joy|Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ...
neutral|Along Queen's Road ...
neutral|Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel .
neutral|Right at the Hilton .
neutral|Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral .
neutral|The Cathedral ?
neutral|Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it .
joy|That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ?
neutral|Yes . Why ?
neutral|Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down .
neutral|Hi , Nally , are you hungry ?
neutral|I'm starving . Let's go grab a bite .
neutral|Where to ?
neutral|How about Karlis ?
surprise|Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch .
neutral|True . ok Let's go to Grumose ?
neutral|Same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg .
neutral|I guess it is a little pricy .
neutral|Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch ..
neutral|That will be Ok . Come on , I can't wait to chow down .
neutral|That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy .
neutral|Is that why you stiffed the waiter ?
neutral|You got it . All right , Let's go back to school .
neutral|Good morning , sir .
neutral|Good morning . I'd like a business suit made with this material .
neutral|Do you have a particular style in mind ?
neutral|The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess .
neutral|I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes .
neutral|I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year .
neutral|The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ?
joy|Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ?
neutral|Next Friday .
joy|Thank you .
sadness|Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me .
neutral|Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 .
neutral|Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful .
neutral|Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age .
neutral|I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it .
neutral|Good luck to us .
neutral|Look , Mary ! There are so many people over there !
neutral|Oh , I remember , there is a job fair in the personnel market .
neutral|I have never been to the personnel market .
surprise|Really ? I have been there several times .
neutral|Are there many employers ?
neutral|Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers .
neutral|So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ?
neutral|Yes , there are many famous corporations .
neutral|When will there be a job fair ?
neutral|Every Saturday and Sunday
neutral|Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ?
neutral|No , it's free .
neutral|How about going there to have a look now ?
neutral|OK , let's go .
neutral|Could you show me the T-shirt on the model ?
neutral|Here you are . We have three different colors , white , blue and pink .
neutral|What's the price ?
neutral|$ 12 .
neutral|Can you make it any cheaper ?
neutral|It is cheap .
neutral|I'll take it if you give me a discount .
neutral|$ 10 . That's the best I can do .
joy|OK . I'll take the blue one .
neutral|Hello , again . Did you discuss everything with your colleagues ?
neutral|Yes , yes . It seems that everything is settled .
neutral|Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ?
neutral|We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not .
neutral|That's not a problem .
neutral|Of course , if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank , or open new accounts with you .
joy|Thank you very much . We always welcome new customers .
neutral|I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .
neutral|We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .
neutral|I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .
neutral|We need to find a good realtor .
neutral|Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .
neutral|What do you mean ?
neutral|Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
neutral|But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .
neutral|Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .
neutral|I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has
neutral|Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .
neutral|So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?
neutral|It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .
neutral|And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
neutral|Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .
surprise|Why ?
neutral|Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .
neutral|Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .
neutral|It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .
neutral|I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .
neutral|Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store .
neutral|I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill .
neutral|Sorry to hear that .
neutral|How about next week ?
neutral|Fine , we'll be expecting you then .
neutral|Which restaurant do you prefer ?
neutral|I'd like to taste Mexican food .
neutral|How about the one on Baker Street ?
joy|Oh , I've never seen a better Mexican restaurant .
neutral|The numbers in this table don't seem to be in accord with reality .
neutral|I know , but these are the figures that we came up with .
neutral|Oh , so the zoo is over there . Thank you so much for your help .
neutral|You ’ re welcome . Can I ask you what brings you to China ?
neutral|I ’ m actually travelling around Asia .
neutral|Oh , very nice . How long will you be in Beijing ?
neutral|Probably another week .
neutral|Oh , I see . Well , I ’ ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide , please call me .
joy|Thank you very much . That ’ s very kind .
neutral|Could you type up this document for me , Sandra ?
neutral|Sure , but I have to finish this report first .
neutral|Never mind . I'll do it .
neutral|Are you interested in mountaineering ?
neutral|Yes , in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you
neutral|I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains .
neutral|How did you spend the night there ?
neutral|We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful .
neutral|I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country .
neutral|Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ?
neutral|Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains .
neutral|I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ?
joy|I'd love to .
neutral|Sir , what's wrong with you ?
neutral|I have a spasm of nausea and dizziness .
neutral|Have you ever suffered from airsickness before ? You're probably airsick .
neutral|No , this is the first time on a plane . Maybe you are right .. Please get me some pills .
neutral|OK . I will get some for you . There's an airsickness bag behind the seat in front of you.Please wait me for a moment . ( Go away for a few minutes , and now she comes back . ) Here are two pills . And the water is in the glass too.Please take the pills with water .
neutral|Thank you very much . ( Take the pills . )
neutral|Are you feeling better now ?
joy|Much better now . Thanks again .
joy|My pleasure .
neutral|Hi Bill , it ’ s Jane .
neutral|Jane , I ’ m on the other line , can you hang on for a second ?
neutral|Sure .
neutral|OK , I ’ ll be right back .
neutral|Have you decided what you'd like ?
neutral|Yes . First I'll have tomato juice .
neutral|And then ?
neutral|I'll have the lamb chops , well-done , please .
neutral|Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ?
neutral|Can you show me some traditional Chinese arts and crafts ?
neutral|Maybe sandalwood fan is good .
neutral|Would you show me some ?
neutral|Of course .
neutral|They really smell fragrant . How much is a real sandalwood fan ?
neutral|The small ones are one hundred yuan for each . And the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan .
neutral|I'll take two small ones and a big one .
neutral|What else are you interested in ?
neutral|I'm afraid not .
joy|OK . Here you are .
neutral|Good morning.Mrs.Smith .
neutral|Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother .
neutral|Well , what kind of books does she like ?
neutral|She's very fond of detective stories ?
neutral|I see.Has she read any detective stories ?
neutral|Oh , yes !
neutral|Do you know if she's read this one ?
neutral|I'm not sure , but she probably won't remember if she has ! She's very forgetful !
neutral|Ah ! She has a bad memory.How old is she ?
neutral|She's eighty-seven .
neutral|I suggest you take this book.It ' s very exciting .
joy|Thank you.That ' s a good idea.she likes exciting books.Can you suggest another one ?
neutral|Hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ?
neutral|Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements .
neutral|Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air .
neutral|I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world !
neutral|Really ? What's the series about ?
neutral|Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .
neutral|It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .
neutral|I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .
joy|Really ? that's interesting !
joy|Yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good .
joy|OK , I'll give it a go .
neutral|Hello , hot water overflowed from the bathtub . Would you help me ?
neutral|Would you turn off the tap ?
neutral|I did it .
neutral|Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door .
neutral|Ok , I will .
neutral|I will have our housekeeper come right away .
neutral|I am sorry , I was too tired to fall asleep .
neutral|When you woke up , the water was coming out the tub ?
neutral|Right . Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?
neutral|Hi . I'm looking for a gift for my niece .
neutral|Well , little girls seem to love Barbie dolls .
joy|That's perfect . I want to see one .
neutral|Here you are — she's called Digital Barbie .
joy|Oh , I like Digital Barbie ! How much does she cost ?
neutral|This Barbie is only $ 29.95 .
joy|That's perfect . Let me have her .
joy|Very good . Is there anything else you would like ?
neutral|No , that'll do it for now .
neutral|Including tax , your total will be $ 32.42 . Cash or charge ?
neutral|Let me give you cash , please .
joy|Here's your change and receipt . Thank you .
neutral|Please put your baggage on the counter and open it , let me have a look .
neutral|Yes , sir . Please examine it .
neutral|Anything subject to duty in your suitcase ?
neutral|No , sir . Nothing except my personal belongings , such as clothes , notebooks and some gifts .
neutral|Any cigarettes or liquor ?
neutral|I have cigarettes for my own use .
neutral|I think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota . And this article is liable for duty .
neutral|How much duty should I pay ?
neutral|One hundred dollars .
neutral|Here is the money .
neutral|Just a moment . I'll make out your duty memo . ( Writing and giving the memo to Mr . Green ) Take it and pay the girl over there .
neutral|Thank you .
neutral|So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ...
neutral|We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ...
neutral|That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket .
neutral|Excuse me , sir , may I talk to you ?
neutral|Bill ! Sure , come on in . What can I do for you ?
neutral|Well sir , as you know , I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years .
neutral|Yes .
neutral|I won ’ t beat around the bush . Sir , I would like a raise . I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first .
neutral|A raise ? Son , I would love to give you a raise , but this is just not the right time .
neutral|I understand your position , and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales , but you must also take into consideration my hard work , pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade .
neutral|Taking into account these factors , and considering I don ’ t want to start a brain drain , I ’ m willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time . How does that sound ?
neutral|Great ! It ’ s a deal ! Thank you , sir !
neutral|Before you go , just out of curiosity , what companies were after you ?
neutral|Oh , the electric company , gas company and water company !
neutral|Are you going to vote on Tuesday ?
neutral|Of course . How about you ?
neutral|I ’ Ve already voted .
neutral|How ’ s that ?
neutral|I sent in an absentee ballot .
neutral|Why ?
neutral|I won ’ t be able to vote on Tuesday .
neutral|Why not ?
neutral|I have to work .
neutral|Why don ’ t you go to work late ?
neutral|I have important business to take care of that morning .
neutral|I see .
neutral|How would you describe your ideal job ?
neutral|I think the job should make use of the professional experience I have obtained , and offer me opportunity for advancement .
neutral|Why do you think you might like to work for our company ?
neutral|I feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and I am very interested.What ' s more , your company is outstanding in this field .
neutral|What makes you think you would be a success in this position ?
neutral|My graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job . I am sure I will be successful .
neutral|How do you know about this company ?
neutral|Your company is very reputed in this city . I heard much praise to your company .
neutral|Did you see the picture of the guy on the front page of the newspaper this morning ?
neutral|No . I haven't had a chance to read the paper yet .
surprise|you've got to see it . It's an unbelievable picture !
neutral|What's so interesting about it ?
surprise|Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off !
neutral|What ? How did that happen ?
neutral|They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face .
neutral|Wow . What does his look like now ?
neutral|It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too .
neutral|What did he look like before his dog bit his face off ?
neutral|He was actually quite handsome . What a shame .
neutral|What's he going to do now ?
neutral|It said that he's hoping to get a face transplant , but until then , he's looking forward to Halloween so he isn't the only one wearing a mask .
neutral|Excuse me . We're leaving today . I'd like to pay our bills now .
neutral|OK . By the way , I'd like to tell you that the check-out time is 12
neutral|I see .
neutral|Have you used any hotel services this morning or had breakfast at the hotel dining room , Mr . Green ?
neutral|Yes , my friend and I just had breakfast at the dining room , but we didn't use any services .
neutral|How about the charge for the days you shared the room with your friend ?
neutral|Please add to my account .
neutral|The total for the eight days is five hundred sixty yuan .
neutral|OK . Here you are .
neutral|I'm not sure about how to operate the washer and dryer .
neutral|What's the problem ?
neutral|I need help turning them on .
neutral|You need change .
neutral|The machines take change ?
neutral|Yes . It costs fifty cents for the washer and a dollar for the dryer .
neutral|Where do i put the money in ?
neutral|You put the coins into the slot , push it in , and it will turn on .
neutral|That's it ?
neutral|There's nothing else to it .
joy|Thank you very much .
joy|You're welcome . Let me know if you need anything else .
neutral|Dad , can you lend me some money ?
neutral|What for ?
neutral|I want to get a ticket for a concert tonight .
neutral|All right.Here ' s the money . I suppose I'll have to drive you there .
neutral|How much money do you expect in this position ?
neutral|With my experience , I'd like to start at 3,000 RIB per month .
neutral|Well , it is a little more than we had planned .
neutral|I think you will find I am worth it .
neutral|Could you help me with these books ?
neutral|My hands are full . Can ’ t you see that ?
neutral|Please , George .
neutral|All right . Just wait a minute , OK ?
neutral|I firmly believe that if we invested in funds we could earn a lot of money .
neutral|All wet.You are such a fool .
neutral|Good afternoon , sir . What can I do for you ?
neutral|I'd like to get this prescription filled .
neutral|No problem . Please wait a minute . ( She goes to the back for a few minutes . ) Here is your medicine , sir . Take two tablets after each meal and once before bed .

neutral|OK . You'll have to pay duty for the whisky .
neutral|Well , where shall I pay the duty for the whisky ?
neutral|Please wait a moment . I'll make out the duty memo . Here you are . Take this and pay the people over there .

neutral|Thank you .

neutral|That's OK . As long as you clean it up .
neutral|Can I help you ?
neutral|Yes , is there any vacant room for tomorrow ?
neutral|I am sorry . We are full up for tomorrow .

neutral|Yes , the Sunset Hotel is three blocks away . Maybe you can ask them .
joy|Thank you .
neutral|What ’ s up ?
neutral|I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ?
neutral|Do you mind I have a look at your computer ?
neutral|Of course not , I appreciate that .
neutral|Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity .
neutral|I see . What can I do now ?
neutral|You can send a compressed one .
neutral|Try it on in front of the mirror .
neutral|Well , I think the color is a little too bright .

neutral|We are interested in some precision machine tools . We have some inquires on hand .
neutral|That's fine . We can supply all kinds of precision machine tools . Our products are much admired in the world market and enjoy a wide acceptance in modern industry .
neutral|Can I have a look at your catalogue and the corresponding technical data ?
neutral|Why , of course . Here are some that will show you our latest development . You may select which ever you need .
neutral|I think our users have the impression that your prices are always much too high , compared with those of other supplies .
neutral|Excuse me . It's true that our products do cost slightly more than the other makers , but It's only due to our technological superiority .
neutral|Your products may have certain advantages , but your prices are too stiff .
neutral|If you give us your inquiry , I shall go very carefully into the price and try my best to put you on the best of the terms .
neutral|OK , I'll come back to discuss it to some details after our users have studied your catalogues and price list .

joy|Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .
neutral|Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
neutral|I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .

neutral|do you like animals ?
neutral|yes , doesn't everyone ?
neutral|what's your favorite animal ?
neutral|it's hard to say . While dogs are more affectionate , cats are much easier to take care of .
neutral|have you ever had a dog ?

neutral|Will you take long ?
neutral|No ! Five minutes I promise !
neutral|Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !
surprise|Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liq
anger|Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon !
anger|What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...
anger|Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon !
neutral|A cup of coffee sounds good , doesn't it ?
neutral|Yes , but I think I'll have orange juice first .

neutral|I'm not sure . I was thinking of making a vegetable .
neutral|What kind of vegetable are you thinking about making ?
neutral|Do you know what kind of vegetable you want to eat ?
neutral|Why don't you make some corn ?
neutral|How would you like the corn ?
neutral|I don't understand what you mean .
neutral|Do you want it boiled , grilled , or microwaved ?
neutral|Why don't you grill it ?

neutral|Thank you for your help , doctor .
neutral|I have a reservation for a single with bath .
neutral|We are sorry , but single rooms have been occupied .
neutral|What's the room rate ? It is a little expensive for me , do you have any other rooms ?
neutral|Then how about this room , with just shower ?
neutral|May I see the room ? I ’ ll take this room . Is the rate for the room only ?

neutral|OK , goodbye .
neutral|Goodbye , sir .
neutral|I need some flowers for my girlfriend .
neutral|No problem . Would you like some artificial carnations ?
neutral|Oh , no . Carnations are not very elegant . Artificial flowers have no passion .
neutral|How much did you want to spend ?
neutral|Money is no object .
neutral|Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily .
neutral|I will take ten .
neutral|Do you want to add some baby's breath for that ? They are equally popular now .
joy|Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ?
neutral|Yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge .
neutral|That's ok . Here is the address .
neutral|Good Morning . What can I do for you ?

neutral|Hey there Chris , what are you up to ?
neutral|I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models .
neutral|Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ?
neutral|Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car .
neutral|So this would be your first automobile ?
neutral|That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike .
neutral|Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order .
neutral|Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot .
joy|So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting !
neutral|Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility .
neutral|Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car .
neutral|I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us .
neutral|Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ?
neutral|Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives .
neutral|I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice .
neutral|Can I help you ?
neutral|I'd like to send a fax to Shenzhen .
neutral|Is it a photograph or a document ?
neutral|Each of both .
neutral|Could I see both of them ?
neutral|Here you are .
neutral|You can't send this document ; it is not clear enough to send . The photograph is all right .
neutral|Well , how long will it take to arrive in Shenzhen ?
neutral|Couple of minutes .
neutral|Great . How much ?
neutral|5 $ . You should change another much clearer photograph for fax .
joy|Thank you . I will deal with it .
neutral|Good morning , can I see your passport , please ?
