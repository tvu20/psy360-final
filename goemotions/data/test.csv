neutral|Loook all around youuuu. All throughout Nature is evidence of a creator and his love ❤️for us
anger|Yes, you selfish prick.
joy|[NAME] so cool
joy|I always fall for this joke on here..
joy|"[NAME]?! Is that [NAME]? I know ""meegwetch"" means thank you lol"
sadness|it's hurting my heart :( why did you leave me
anger|Other than a lame attempt of being insulting, what part of anything you said has anything to do with what I said?
neutral|Not alone my friend
joy|You need to recheck your science. A simple Google search will yield research articles showing a biological and genetic basis for being LGBT. Happy reading!
anger|[NAME] fucking practice and watch some tutorials before fucking up a $100 bottle of French champagne
neutral|While that is cute-try to do critical thinking while u are reading. Prove your god exsists-let him smite me. That mighty smiter.
neutral|yep, you don't hate Mondays, you hate capitalism.
joy|Wowowowow!!!! I’ve been campaigning for [NAME] too!
anger|But they didn't because it's fake.
joy|Happy cake day to him
neutral|This counts as a problem if you have that many in one day or something
neutral|To me it’s sounds like he is trying to find fault in her to make himself feel better about leaving her.
joy|Yes. Ignore and move on
surprise|Happy? Not really, but glad we can come to a conclusion to my offhand semi in jest reply.
joy|This doesn't belong on the competitive sub; it doesn't have anything to do with the competitive aspect of the game.
joy|Naaah, that is and always will be [NAME], especially since her redesign in MKX. perfect waifu.
anger|Lmfao lonzo? That guy is not nba talent. World is gonna spank that ass
joy|I actually did talk to him. You can see his response to me, I linked to it in a comment. He called me a land whale.
neutral|I though [NAME] was the offensive guru? Why would he get an established guy who has an offense?
joy|This sub doesn’t like the pro sports teams until they win a championship. Then everyone becomes a die hard fan.
joy|Had one good year that was it, then joins a god squad that struggles to qualify
anger|Break up and be firm about. You’ve already admitted to being dishonest. Why lead him on?
neutral|That would look enormous if [NAME] ordered it!
anger|I’m not a fan of that hire at all... I’m also not a fan about how that all came out. All around bad.
disgust|Thats absolutely disgusting.
joy|No, that looks h*ckin delicious
joy|Don't listen to the idiot, we love your posts!
neutral|Ha! Getting him back with his own schtick!
neutral|Open a ticket and wait. These next two weeks will be very telling. All we can do is wait.
neutral|I want to see this a a movie!!
joy|Man, never underestimate the power of a crock pot, some frozen chicken, veggies and cottage cheese.
surprise|Where were they? I was trying to track them down and couldn’t remember where I saw them.
joy|There is also no dog in the white house. Why? Because dogs can smell an asshole a mile away.
sadness|Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings.
joy|Lmao I hope I’m not the only one who gets this
surprise|*looks at YouTube comments sections* Um. I'm not so sure.
anger|This man makes aggressive grunts while breathing
neutral|My boy [NAME] <3
joy|Wow! Now that's some propaganda we could use more of!
neutral|They seceded because [NAME] was elected despite not appearing on any slave owning states. How is this anything but under representation of ideology.
joy|Yes! My Big Fat Fabulous Life
neutral|Author thinks that a guy who bounced back and forth between a bench role and AAA will bounce back and forth between a bench role and AAA.
neutral|Ironically, I just sense that they are working in an area where this is a ready stream of revenue just waiting for them.
joy|My mom used to think [NAME] was the handsomest NFL coach for what that’s worth.
neutral|No if anything the exact opposite. Couldn’t be further from the truth
sadness|Sorry your right
neutral|Well, 1/2 has been done already!
joy|I trust Safeway over Great Canadian Superstore for my meats. I know I'm not alone in that regard. Safeway has some pretty good cheaper meats.
sadness|I missed that part unfortunately
anger|Market ≠ Capitalism Just because something operates within the Capitalist system doesn't make it Capitalist. Just because [NAME] was (supposedly) elected didn't make him democratic
neutral|Takes all characteristics, good and bad
sadness|This.. im sorry but this is a dumb reply. Ofc it was fake kindness golly
neutral|I hieaa i just trip out how your lds and not know or here. Nevermo here a d hears when i was a kid
neutral|Yes had the problem a month or so ago but has since gone away
anger|China cheating the rest of the world is horrible for the economy and society.
joy|>overt racism of that level would not be tolerated in America My thoughts also. That's why i needed context, its very VERY odd.

joy|So handsome
surprise|Are they dead? I don’t recall this bit of the Nativity play.
sadness|I am embarrassed to admit that I was shocked to find out that his books all had the same exact weight and that you knew what that weight was...

joy|Well I'm trying to improve, man
joy|Thanks a bunch <3
joy|I just want tk be a random scumbag
neutral|Very possible but there's absolutely zero indication were working on a deal to trade [NAME] currently. We're not just going to trade him away for peanuts.
joy|I agree that you need more time in the later turns. But most games it feels like people wait until it is their turn to start thinking.
joy|Hopefully you saved that letter!
neutral|LIGHT THE BEACONS!
joy|Would I love to be a fly on your wall right now and watch this whole debacle.
neutral|How do you know this?
joy|What do you think women do? I’m quiet as a churchmouse when I mastrubate, too
neutral|That's what they want though. So if you really want to 'win' their battles, simply ignore them :)
anger|He keeps saying this in my playthrough when that's definitely NOT what I'm doing. I just suck at hunting!!
anger|One dumbass who hasn’t watched Hereditary complaining about meaningless awards on the Internet means... eh. I lost my point. Go watch Hereditary
joy|This was so touching ❤️❤️❤️
surprise|Has he done this with other world leaders, too? Or only [NAME]?
anger|Wait... dogs can’t use ladders!
joy|That’s just fucked lol talk about cheap.
anger|What the fuck is this about?
joy|You could notice he was a little bit nervous, i think that was the main reason for his way of playing in this game.
joy|I didn't realise this was happening! Thank you! It was hard to tell from OPs photo what the changes were
joy|She does NOT love you. Try to ask yourself why you are accepting this treatment.
joy|Lol omg yesssss. Probably the best suggestion anyone ever told me 🙌🏼
neutral|Wich stinks for you
surprise|Why would I do that?
neutral|Another day, another Newsweek article reporting what some commentator said on TV.
joy|Thanks so much for the advice! Will definitely keep that in mind
joy|Subscribed to sjwstories, thanks for informing me about that one!
surprise|I wonder if truly might be work stress. He works long hours at a prestigious law firm. I need to five him more credit.
joy|I like this feeling
anger|Trusting readers is something we cannot afford in this day and age.
anger|Not really, just wanted to know why specifically you thought he was on gear. (Because I honestly don't see it)
joy|Don't include me in this us! Just kidding.. We need some love and fast.
anger|Why would they stop magicking away their shit. That seems more practical than a giant plumbing network.
neutral|[NAME] can’t hurt us anymore.
neutral|You beat nerfed [NAME]. Sounds like tier lists do matter.
neutral|The [RELIGION] Church has been raping children for decades, that we know about. More likely hundreds of years. Probably since they've existed.

neutral|#cooking #uni #urchin #local #tidetotable #truecooks #seafood #cheflife
joy|Agreed. There is r/clevercomebacks but this is just not even that.
joy|Dark Crystal, Neverending Story, Labyrinth. My holy trinity of movies I both loved and was intimidated by as a child.
joy|All it takes is just a bit Practice and thanks!
sadness|As a lifelong single person, [NAME] offends me. Feels like I'm apart of some demographic that they can live without :(
anger|So creepy. Made me check my locks.
anger|[NAME] I hate my hometown
anger|You shut your mouth
neutral|>I mean look at socialist Germany. Look at Night of the Long Knives.
fear|Oof that’s terrible

joy|yikes I am not reading that, the napkins are over there sir, have a nice day
anger|No, it's not that one
neutral|ah maybe next time
neutral|Well someone posted the ingredients in the comments below. I’m still new to the whole vegan thing.

neutral|Whammer!
neutral|Of course I remember a time when I didn't know what calories were. I was a child.
neutral|I've had a few blisters from hot welds, but nothing that bad...
joy|Thank you, its like if you looked a camera that was taking a picture of your ear, you wouldn’t be able to see it.
neutral|Just know that you are the man. Go Isles. Go Flames.
neutral|Who says they weren’t? If they were, they were probably ignored, or drowned out by the [NAME].
joy|:) thank you!
anger|Maybe try living a little longer before you talk about things you don't know about, sweaty. NEXT!
neutral|Well if you read my other posts you’d know I did try to end it in a responsible mature way and he refused sooo
joy|Awesome, love the input! I totally get what you’re saying!
anger|I would hate to see another [NAME] situation where [NAME] gets hurt again because he wasn't fully recovered.
joy|Much love half purple homie
neutral|Molon labe!!!
neutral|The [NAME] did send his only son to score for our Pens! We are REDEEMED!
joy|I know a couple of people who are. It's amazing to watch.
sadness|Must be a tough life when all you can think about is sad stories to keep you from enjoying anything.
surprise|Should I watch this? Will it aggravate me?
joy|I believe in you. Do what is right for you. I hope you feel better soon too. ♥️🙂
neutral|That was one of the things that I didn't think about and I already gave a delta for that.
joy|That's sad. I'm 16 and where I am there are loads of athiests my age. It's great.
joy|"Same here! I thought too long and hard about whether or not la jolla/Encinitas was known as the ""treasure coast"""
anger|Do you have any non anecdotal stuff to say or? Also burden of proof is a thing, you made a claim, prove it or fuck off

anger|That specific block is probably one of the worst in the city.
neutral|When is the battle point for squad spawning back?
anger|He’s a way worse version of [NAME]. I don’t think anyone is putting him in their top 15 besides Bears fans.
disgust|You're disgusting
neutral|1. Use chicken thighs 2. Dryness doesn't matter with this much fat.
anger|Exactly. We’re only here for the money, assholes.
sadness|She is probably cheating on you. :(
neutral|at least you’re getting hit on
surprise|The reaction was contained under the bandaid due to big pharma’s nanobot technology to help disguise the TRUTH. :P
anger|It would be mostly home-grown terrorism, angry at all the people fleeing from overseas terrorism.
joy|Ah good call - I dont plan to take submissions for that reason
anger|Personal insults aren't allowed around here. 1 week ban for first offense.
joy|I've been watching it recently and it is such an amazing show!
joy|Why would you mention [NAME]? Lol
anger|Don’t tempt me!
joy|I hope you get the help you need. Truly.

joy|I love this ahahah

anger|First [NAME], now [NAME]. Stop the conks. Please.

neutral|Mmmmm tasty 🅱️estrogens
sadness|Damn. I'm sorry. What misery.
joy|Oh interesting username
joy|Thank you for saying this. It is disrespectful to me. And it hurts.
anger|You should've smashed his head into it.
neutral|Looks like emotionally and physically beating the shit out of his wife and children was not wasted then.
anger|> don't tax anyone what a stupid idea.
surprise|Before telling you anything....what exactly do you want out of this?
neutral|I just tell myself that I'll be put together for some girl. She won't have to treat me like a fixer upper.
neutral|The only cringe is some of y'all obsessing over every little thing Eureka does.
neutral|Don’t wait. Take control of your life back and leave. You know that’s what’s going to happen.
joy|Aww, thank you [NAME] for capturing me!!
joy|Ohh.. Thank you!
neutral|And *they are the ones* talking about NPCs!
joy|Well thanks for sharing. I loved it. Do you know of any others from them that aren't well known?
neutral|Petey ot [NAME]. Let's go. Hockey gods cannot forsake us this much

joy|I get wound up over completely imagined conversations too 😅 I'm trying to meditate and learn to stop myself from going down the rabbit hole.

anger|Contractions is equivalent....body can only deal with...us women with labor.....I don’t like the way this person speaks.

joy|She's absolutely stunning in that photo
anger|Dummy I'm disagreeing with you
joy|I would try rubbing alcohol, high percentage. Looks greasy to me.

fear|I don't know any but my own I'm afraid.
joy|Most valuable comment
anger|[NAME], learn some fucking grammar and punctuation. Maybe use some paragraphs. Just an idea.
joy|Yeah. If you try not to ignore the photos it's right there.
joy|This internet stranger is also super proud of you! Way to go!!!
surprise|Man, I assumed it was already out and I'd missed it.
sadness|Idiots are downvoting your correct comment.
sadness|If that’s true it’s very desperate. You would think he had some better way of communicating.
joy|I believe that you can search for providers here. Good luck and good on ya.
fear|Because the hierarchy is afraid they’ll get burned.
anger|Nah I dont think the panthers are good enough
neutral|[NAME] what a dork you are to think the above comment means I am daft to the behavior endured by women for way too long.
neutral|It's cool.

neutral|2010. [NAME] being all desperate, [NAME] return. Shit was gold

joy|Oi us cancers don’t want him either! We respectfully pass his birthday to April
anger|This almost certainly should not have gone to OT. SEC refs are bad CBB refs are bad
surprise|Normally drop n roll. In this case I would remove my clothes because I doubt rolling would help.
neutral|Let's go boys
sadness|Not at all. It's great of course for financial reasons, but it then makes me worried about how much time she'll have for a relationship.
joy|I agree!!! His character has grown so much throughout the entire series and I was very disappointed that he ended up with her.
fear|Matchroom squad dismiss [NAME] as not existing anymore, the sky media influence is scary
neutral|[NAME] didn't want to deal with [NAME] (reasonable) and [NAME] had more foreign policy experience and credentials than [NAME] did at the time.

neutral|Ah, the old [NAME] to [NAME] to [NAME] to [NAME] pipeline.
neutral|iirc they were changing a few servers names, tht might have caused a few issues
neutral|[NAME] vs. Being an actual coach
joy|Probably the most rational way to look at this entire scenario - thanks for posting this my dude. That comment set me straight again.

surprise|Someone made a similar joke and got 500 down votes.
joy|[NAME] was a great coach
anger|Fuuuuuck. That’s the worst I’ve seen.

joy|This is really cool and well made!
surprise|Surprise my what now?

anger|He is nearly 25, can't shoot, can't dribble and does nothing great. He wont improve much.
joy|So [NAME] is really a fan of playing the bench vs the other team's starters at the end of halves. Really finding every tanking edge possible.

joy|This is amazing
neutral|"It looks like how [NAME] is introducing the comedians in ""Whose line is it anyway ?"""
anger|clearly no one is getting my joke oof.

joy|That’s pretty accurate
neutral|Also one of my favorite parts of this story.
surprise|What was the end result of this?
disgust|They have directly targeted civilians. It's disgusting.
joy|looks cool, i want it now.
joy|The applause came from [NAME] and his group.
joy|Um, excuse me? I'm a *rolling* rabbit hole, thank you
surprise|In the first combo if you just do the b+k instead of even bothering to kick it does 1 more damage Not much obviously but yeah just a thought
anger|I don't find anything about women appealing.

joy|I'm flattered but I'm a good [RELIGION] scarf
neutral|"Result of ""I have camera so I'm invincible"" syndrome."
surprise|Why is neighbour spelt incorrectly?
joy|That would be okay, I guess.
joy|Paraphrasing [NAME], this brought warm feelings to my heart.
surprise|That's interesting. Have you used it to register on many sites/services?
neutral|And big boobs! Like, what?
joy|You’re not a loser. You’re a whole and complete person unto yourself.
neutral|We've been linking that dodgy-as-hell Ukrainian site for years, so go nuts.
neutral|"For liquids I might leave the ""7"" out and make sure your citizens are the only race that can spawn in highly savage areas."

joy|Lol you're so close to getting it, dude. So close.
neutral|Yeah mason wasps are nasty little Tucker’s.

surprise|Actually maybe the OP is not an INTP, have you thought about that!!
neutral|With [NAME] and [NAME] back, and [NAME] waiting in the wings, would you still want an EDGE in round 1?

neutral|Logic and facts are verboten on that sub. Truly bizarre that people are that sensitive.
joy|Well the good news is once all the boomers die off you won't have any pesky old people to blame anymore.
joy|What a cute little accident you turned out to be
neutral|Just wanted to mention--Brazos Bend is closed due to flooding until next week.

anger|Yeah thank you you ungrateful bast.....
surprise|I don’t know who the hell [NAME] is but I am now curious after seeing the word “again”.

neutral|Stick your head in a blender and leave it on for all year. Turn it off for October and half of November...then right back into it

joy|At least she's correct
neutral|I believe the term is grill inspector
sadness|[NAME] death is just so..... senseless. Why? WHY??? The based gods have forsaken us
neutral|You're not really pissing anyone off. Mostly we just pity you.

neutral|Stay in bed and binge watch a new show, my suggestion Brooklyn 99
joy|Way to go! I know who this couple is! they appear really happy!

joy|Sorry to hear about that and hope you have moved on.
joy|Canada is full of nice people, but has also produced some pretty gnarly serial killers, so...
neutral|Nobody should keep any around that is this ass-cracked to oblivion.
neutral|Presuming you are in the mitten as well. Solidarity sister. My house too looks like a bomb went off and my toddler hates clothes.
neutral|This. This is too realistic man. Too late for this too.

surprise|You too huh?
joy|toxic players will sure show you the ways soon enough. Hope you got the game for free.

sadness|His army of Swedish blondes are going to be upset.
sadness|>Sorry, but any city that had any kind of ~~epidemic in its~~ history will have bunches of dead people buried under it.

anger|Nobody likes you nonhuman mimics and everyone knows what you are.
sadness|Hold my wine, I have to go vomit in sorrow.
neutral|The Mavs would probably have to give up some picks as well

neutral|You'll find a few down South, too. No surprise.
fear|I know, I know, but CAN YOU BLAME ME FOR BEING NERVOUS
neutral|You are. It's the cat. She looked away right when you turned the camera over towards her. She'd deliberately trying to mislead you.

neutral|Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that the name changes had more to do with legal issues then geographical ones.

neutral|Didn't even take a sip of the wine, and he still got wasted.
anger|This really circled my jerk

joy|I honestly loved her performance as [NAME] in Scott Pilgrim. But then again I also love Scott Pilgrim so...
anger|Just like that fucking idiot that was just trying to kidnap that woman, and chased her into a Karate studio... turned out just about the same.
joy|Love the alliteration here.
joy|Try Venezuela. It's your communist utopia in action.
surprise|I'm not saying to hate them, I'm wondering why this sub just started worshiping them.
joy|Had to sober up before I could figure out YouTube, but that was amazing.
neutral|Ugh. [NAME] [NAME] (another British celeb)
anger|Why is it that EVERY SINGLE TIME ONE OF THESE HAPPENS I’m only like a day late
neutral|>Shouldn’t the Bible be infallible No. That would be idolatry. Only [NAME] is infallible,

sadness|This just makes me feel inferior at this point.
disgust|Terrible shade of lipstick she's wearing...

joy|Hm, I haven’t heard that opinion before but it sounds good. Thanks for the advice!
neutral|We were all that way when we were 17 too
joy|Oh of course!
neutral|I think most of these pictures would be much scarier if we had the perspective of the guy
sadness|Hurr durr everyone needs to worry about other people’s problems
surprise|Before he was riding a Bronco he was riding your mom.

neutral|You're in the wrong subs
joy|"Haha, some days I channel Dory from finding nemo- ""Just keep swimming, just keep swimming"". Glad to hear you have a break coming. "
joy|[NAME] being discussed as top 15-20 pick, [NAME] top 5 and [NAME] early round 2. This would be the most amazing draft ever though lol

joy|This has to be a joke. Your written word is atrocious.
anger|Hey mods... let's not allow articles pushing unsubstantiated rumour from poor sources
joy|Why not? Just go for it. It'll make a great story to tell at your 50th wedding anniversary party.
anger|"I've said it before, and I'll say it again. ""I don't want fucking unity with racists who put children in cages""."
anger|This is an uninformed and incorrect statement. It doesn’t take even close to that long.
anger|Nah man I prefer endless cause of the part where he goes WOMWOMWOMWOMWOMWOM WOOOOOO REEEEEEEEE like that's lyrical genius right there
neutral|Feeling is exhausting. They used to feel those things and now they feel nothing because they're so burnt out and tired
joy|"lol, as he goes down on you he suddenly screams into your vagina ""THE BEES THE BEES""."
neutral|Same outfit as the cute art school barista that works at my coffee shop

fear|Scary stuff.
joy|I love this!!! You got it!

neutral|Starving in the belly, starving in the belly, starving in the belly of a whale
neutral|They had a similar panel last year. It's definitely worth a watch.
joy|Better hope nobody steals your keys
surprise|What about fees? Much of the hit for a payday loan isn't interest, technically, it's fees.
joy|that's really good
neutral|Every time I see someone walking around with their toddler now all I can think is *poor basrard, he has no idea what's coming*.
joy|ooohhhh when he look at the camera at the end it's the cutest shit ever
joy|But I think his feelings care about the fact that he's still not tall enough to ride any of the roller coasters at Disneyland
joy|I love how serious and mad cats get when the dog starts messing around with them all playful
anger|That sucks man, I'm sorry. Things will get better, they always do in the end
anger|Ah ok, that makes more sense. I don’t think most [NAME] would see your last name and try to make it French, lol.

neutral|More accurate, relevant map
neutral|1.283 on a comment but I don't really go after normal posts for karma
joy|I sure hope so! Otherwise, I've been in the wrong sub.

neutral|[NAME] is another worthless [NAME]. Utah is unbelievably stupid for voting for him.

anger|Yeah I know what you meant. Fuck the police, most of them are vile pieces of shit, they deserve every kick in the back they get.
surprise|What a turnaround.

anger|You should like a troll. Not saying you are.
sadness|Meanwhile my sister won’t even hug my goodbye when I drop her off at school.
anger|She does it again in last nights episode, it’s so shady!!
neutral|I definitely saw a tweet where someone threw their razor in their toilet. They’re gonna have to fish it out sometime...
anger|It's not free, though. It's ridiculously expensive.
joy|Heh, don't know how it was back then but I'd really suggest giving it a spin now - it's like life-consumingly good!
anger|That is patently false, considering his history of driving multiple businesses into the ground.
joy|It’s time for some moderator field work!
surprise|Pretty sure you could do that with a cargo ship too, so I'm not sure I buy that argument.
joy|[NAME] has some great videos on the guy. He's definitely a piece of work.

neutral|That would involve reading, and redhats aren't so good at that.
joy|This makes me very happy, thank you for sharing!
sadness|I was just gonna say this look like fake karma.

neutral|Definitely not just on this sub. I keep seeing them on Instagram too.
neutral|Do your research = listen to anecdotal evidence from users(totally reliable!) and try it out, just be comfy!
joy|A good therapist can lead you to talking about what you need to talk about once they get to know you and your emotions and trends
joy|Idk if I’m wrong but I think they gave her some piercings on her ear which are cool too

neutral|Unpack it, spread it around, share your fatphobia with everyone!

joy|""" Alright Little orphan [NAME], it's time for you to start earning your keep around here!"""
anger|Yeah that's not nearly as dramatic and aggressive as the ball in the above video.
joy|I doubt I'll ever own one of those, I'm a bookworm and I love the smell of old books. Thanks for the info, nonetheless.
joy|Lol there you go. Forgot to switch back from your alt for a second there.
joy|I love [NAME], but this sounds like he’s claiming signing a 26 year old superstar is stupid. Come on.
surprise|This is his speculation or a leak?
joy|I live downtown and walk around at odd hours of the night all the time. Love the empty and abandoned feel of the city.
joy|Got a good laugh out of that. Plenty of wall of shame material.
neutral|FYI… the [NAME] has these in their kitchen in “ That 70s Show.”
joy|Some of them will have to get new vehicles to meet the requirements. That means we get cleaner air. Where's the problem exactly?
joy|Awesome! Thank you!
neutral|They cannot bypass racial discrimination without facing a serious backlash.
sadness|Humanity is doomed
joy|Probably vallied out man haha

neutral|Always thought [NAME] spear look lethal...especially compared to someone like [NAME].

joy|And why would I do that? Edit: Thanks for setting up that Walder Frey line for me
anger|Plot twist: they don‘t Want to Go To school
neutral|Firemen make roughly 30000£ in UK today.
joy|2-4 minutes is not enough time to wash long hair. 10-15 minutes minimum. Stay strong!
neutral|Total non-reaction by the trio of guys. ‘There goes [NAME] again. Every time we come out here.’
neutral|[NAME] and [NAME] Funny thing is they both had a feud too and were in the ring at same time a lot
anger|That's not a healthy way of thinking. Obviously that dude was troubled and, without proper help, he would have done these things regardless.
surprise|Unless you're the type of person who rolls through relationships every 3-6 months like clockwork
joy|I’m glad I’m not the only one who was pedantic enough to notice.
anger|Are you daft ... ? That is and always has been the proposal. [NAME] don't listen and don't care though. Fucking dumbass.

neutral|[NAME]. Think there’s some controversy over how common that was though
neutral|This is the reason why I don't have friends. Not even skinny ones, you never know how they will be in the furure

neutral|My favourite is peeing in restrooms and your feet can't touch the floor while sitting on the toilet.
joy|I love how many penguins stopped and waited for him 😍
neutral|ok? dont really know what that has to do with it. [NAME] designs the offense, [NAME] just runs it
neutral|Sounds like he's lying to you both. You probably would have a lot of heart ache if you continue to be involved with this one.
joy|Thank you, next!
joy|Going to the doctor tomorrow for a checkup to make sure everything is normal and hopefully this shit is just in my head.
sadness|you guys got hate in your heart
neutral|DAE hate unnecessarily salty people like OP?
joy|That’s adorable! He probably wants them all in one spot so he can make sure they’re ok and not getting lost or hurt.
joy|I think you'll find that dating is really difficult for poly men. It's the biggest reason why I'm monogamous.
joy|It’s perfect. You’re perfect. Never change.
neutral|"""are you related?"" ""No"" ""Are you <more specific type of related>?"""
joy|“Lol that’s Sammie coates replacement not minds take it how you want to I am back”- [NAME] - AB

joy|lol classic [NAME]
joy|Awesome! Welcome aboard! I'm glad your first game was a win!
joy|I am proud of you random internet stranger, you peopled good today.

neutral|This. It IS a minority here, but they are very vocal and very active, exactly what you would expect from a PR team
joy|You're* Stay in school lol
sadness|I didn't know of [NAME] before I saw that episode. I fucking love that man and have watched an unhealthy amount of him since.
neutral|I'm sure that's a really important issue to you that consumes your daily life...
neutral|Wow I’m sorry. Can you take pictures of your bruises? What was she nagging you about?
surprise|"What part of ""Yeah but still"" do you not understand dude?"
anger|Your link won't load and are you seriously citing fucking Syria as a successful example of anything? [NAME] holy motherfucking pecker.
disgust|Well one of them is a dirty kimono wearing weirdo
anger|No one wants the wrong person executed for a crime fool
neutral|Also wanna point out that it’s just for like 10mil+ iirc
joy|I totally thought that this match would be a draw due to [NAME] interfering. I should never make any picks in the pick'em contest ever again.
joy|Excellent, I was wondering about [NAME] the moron recently.
joy|I hate you for that title. Thanks a lot. /s Right as I’m about to go to sleep too.
surprise|Wow. Forget the separation, lawyer up and go straight to divorce.

anger|I cant think of anything funny to say so upvote to give me free karma
neutral|How did [NAME] just give that beatdown to Attach, the other player was so far away.
joy|No one makes it through. We all die. Just some sooner than others.
joy|It's great! And it's his own choice, you don't force him.
joy|So true. The chicks I pick up from clubbing are nothing compared to the love of a good woman.
neutral|100% correct. Seriously, listen to [NAME] talking points when she mentions Syria. Matches RT propaganda exactly.
anger|I can't do that....I don't know how to hard boil eggs sooooo
neutral|Oh, I don’t work there. My bf is in a band that plays there often.
neutral|I DO NOT NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS this is what I tell my 3.5 year old on the daily
joy|That's nothing, before BSE we did horrible things with bone meal animal feed. Cannibal cows.

disgust|"I've tried the ""peanut butter""...I almost vomited. NASTY! It went straight to the trash."
anger|[NAME] would be really pissed off to lose c3po and r2 to the fucking destroy ending
neutral|Episode IX is apparently about [NAME] going back to Jakku
joy|I really love how this team responds to injuries
neutral|His opponent got DQ for pinching off [NAME] air tube. His first opponent is why [NAME] had the air tube in the first place.

joy|I... don‘t see anything wrong with that?
neutral|y i k e s

anger|[NAME] FIRED.
neutral|"I grew up in the south and we ate casseroles all the time. So I share your ""what?!?!"""
joy|Except [NAME] still went with the happy ending instead of ending it at the Aningaaq scene.
neutral|Yeah this is downright spooky; she's not even using that face mask.
anger|YOU LIKE TURTLES? Gimme a second.
anger|"""You can't stop me"" Ah yes, those playful words when referring to a sexual act..."
joy|Yeah, I wouldn't be too surprised by that either. I'm so excited to see or hear SOMETHING though.
anger|This is a toxic behaviour.. get rid of him as soon as possible.
surprise|Wouldn’t be shocked for a lot of those guys to follow him to TB.
neutral|[NAME]? Y’all [NAME] are weird AF (and I love it).

joy|I needed this today. Thanks stranger
neutral|Coming for dat golden state ass!

sadness|I never knew cringing could be so ...cathartic.
joy|The co-worker thing is generally for the best,the rest I agree.
joy|Wtf if this is true it’s the funniest thing I’ve read all day.
joy|Change your mindset to not expect anything in return, if they do great if not...their loss
joy|I agree with you, I just don't believe it will happen.
anger|You missed the point 🙃
joy|Wow, so he was pulling his own little mini [NAME] scam. Explains why he couldn't use your reporting tool.

joy|I'm really happy he and [NAME] are finding success
anger|I just say I don't know shit. I'm just a ape man on a rock.

anger|Pam Beesly and Jim... What a waste.
joy|They lived a good life! I honor them by using all their parts
joy|I think that had to do more with not wanting to hurt the old man lol
surprise|The banana speaks! Do you just type one to three words in your comments or do you get an integer overflow if you go for four?

anger|You don't really work for the TSA if they aren't paying you. You are a slave. Go home.

surprise|Okay but how about someone who doesn’t believe the Wifi signals are going to kill us?
neutral|We should have just taken him regardless and told them to deal with it but we also might not have [NAME] if we do
joy|Enjoy :) You won't regret it. The first couple seasons will be a little confusing but wiki helped me understand this show a lot!

joy|I think it was [NAME] and I'm not even convinced [NAME] caught on to it lol. Then he was made to be the moron.

joy|So more [NAME]? No thanks. Love the guys, but that’s for side projects.
neutral|Leaving [RELIGION] and planning to FINALLY live MY life to the fullest without white men in white shirt telling me what to do every second of my day!!
joy|Op is likely young and clueless. There’s likely a reason they’re in retail.
joy|They are all good right now. Pick the one that interests you and enjoy yourself.
joy|I rarely like or comment on YouTube. But I make hella playlists so I guess I use it more as a tool than a community.
neutral|I think ignoring intentions is ridiculous too, but I also think that only looking at intentions (and at face value) is a bit naive
joy|I'm just glad we'll be getting either [NAME] or [NAME]. They both seem like they'll be beasts and it'll fill our greatest position of need
surprise|Unlikely, but who knows? Memory speed rarely makes a difference in gaming, but I've seen stranger things.

surprise|It kinda makes sense. What’s the debate here?
neutral|The one where MIL flooded the whole house
neutral|Damn you [NAME]!
neutral|Theres not really any structure or composition to this. The color scheme is tight but it's just kind of thrown on there without any direction.
joy|Thanks for the reply! I’ll probably just smoke, as you said, once maybe twice a month. Thanks again!
joy|Sometimes those are the only options. Laughing makes other people feel better at least so that's what you gotta do.
joy|Not my opinion either, but the soundtrack is easily one of the best parts of the game. It’s incredible.
anger|Text to speech is a very very bad idea. You do not want to give 4,000 people full control over what gets said out loud on a stream.
anger|Some of them are delusional and believe their victims want it
joy|Thanks I hate it.
neutral|Title made me think I was on r/boottoobig for a second

neutral|From your username and the fact that you had to type that you’re NOT underage: now feels like you are
sadness|Enough food to feed the whole village just wasted
joy|We've been pretty good for the most part the last 5 years. I mean, [NAME] saying [NAME] betrayed him isn't ideal but could be worse.
joy|The ending was so badass as a young kid! He wasnt even in his mech!
neutral|She’s had her ass pounded before.
joy|Signed up! This is brilliant!
anger|Leave they don't deserve you and you don't need those sacks of shit

neutral|I mean, she is
neutral|Garlic butter baked chicken.....put garlic butter on chicken and bake.
neutral|Still makes no sense how [NAME] beat corrupted [NAME] while [NAME] and [NAME] couldn't beat his normal version
joy|That’s so scummy, I’m hoping the pepperoni just slid down?
neutral|I’ve never seen such dramatic tongue involvement.
surprise|Us girls are taught to always be polite. Screw that, safety is more important.
joy|I wish I could be desensitized to my sadness sometimes lol
neutral|Because they're all done by the same, really, really old guy
joy|I realize that, but the picture is still funny
neutral|At least she showed a reaction...

joy|I'm replying just bask in the glow with someone else! Yay!!
anger|Uh, people kept asking me if I was jailor and I said no, and based on this chat you can also see that jailor is not smart.
neutral|Now this exactly what I came to this sub for
surprise|Does that caption say [NAME] and [NAME] are planning to move to Austin....? Dear [NAME] PLEASE no we already have [NAME]!
anger|I agree totally. Talk about fucking insanely bizarre. He's stuck in the shining

joy|Well I WISH SOMEONE WOULD'VE TOLD ME THAT
neutral|You have no regard for due process or the law if you're suggesting [NAME] be charged with evidence tampering because there is nothing to back up that claim.
disgust|Ironically every /pol/ meetup is more diverse than the people pushing diversity and race mixing. Weird how that works huh
surprise|Did you noticed they removed my post? Yep.

neutral|[NAME] is 110% 24/7/365 all the time Swag, I just can't fathom.
sadness|Unfortunately, successful and rich people blame foreigners too :(
neutral|Kid thinks he’s [NAME]! Mmm... Pound cake...
surprise|What happened in his personal life? I know he had a bunch of head injuries; is there more than that?
anger|When you insult someone you might want to start by insulting them to where they can understand what you're trying to say...who givES A fuck .
neutral|[NAME] will be livid if he does not get a burger but see [NAME] stuffing his face.
surprise|I'm surprised he survived the primary.
surprise|The altcoin thread!? This is the first time I've seen it in 6 months.
surprise|"Can we not say ""Team [NAME]"" or ""Team [NAME]"" etc. That's too close to us style politics for my likes..."
neutral|The cognitive dissonance is strong with you.
sadness|I find it unfortunate that you use gender-non-conformance as an insult.
anger|The only ignorant person here is you, and the Pope who makes the same baseless claims as you.
neutral|It's the issue with a lot of 'activists' who think all's they have to do is exist.
surprise|Oh, I realized that moments after rolling down my window, when his hand came through the space.
anger|[NAME] is a MOTHERFUCKER
neutral|Oh sweet I get [NAME] powers
surprise|This response is highly unexpected yet logical. I’m fixin to chew on it for a spell.
joy|hahah if only he had reddit
joy|Not a fan of Hot Space. I like one song on there and that's Under Pressure.
joy|I love it! It’s strangely charming lol!!! Especially when she comes back to camera speaking normally.
joy|Having a good list of alternatives would be something great we could produce
neutral|The must be on the prowl because I've been getting these calls a lot lately.
disgust|People are disgusting and insane.
joy|Quite enjoying this tbh
neutral|UNLESS THEY ARE ABUSIVE OR IT'S AN LDR!
anger|0.1% is a 1 in a thousand chance there, dumbass.
neutral|Just a simple man trying to make his way in the galaxy
anger|Damned asshole trouble maker!! Someone has mummy issues. 👀
surprise|What reason do you have for not already having been prepared?
surprise|I am shocked they don’t have a vanity plate that reads “Beer Cheez”
joy|"Gotta love how ""QUESTIONING"" is front and center in the list of things these warriors for [NAME] consider brainwashing."
neutral|Imma say this didn’t happen
anger|Soooo [NAME] is f**ked
neutral|Intp:(
neutral|Just report his comments let the mods take care of this misogynistic twit
joy|[NAME] has had this problem forever. Hopefully she fixes it, because it gets old and is a relationship killer
neutral|They're a Queens family. [NAME] would be one of those dudes who sits outside of Bodegas and bothers high school girls when they walk by.
joy|What a brave man.
anger|he's clearly not equipped to argue, i can't decide if he's a dumbass teenager or a dumbass boomer.
neutral|Wouldn’t doubt its for good reasons, just didn’t understand what the were.
neutral|Mirror
neutral|Never heard of anything other than brain freeze. Are the cheese heads moving south?
joy|...Nobody ever remembers [NAME]. If you could see those others, you certainly could see [NAME], which is the second biggest of the lot.
joy|That’s a pretty high amount to pay per week over here, don’t know about the us though.
joy|Oh well maybe your cousin gave his account info to someone lol.
joy|My thoughts exactly, I hope [NAME] doesn't get too much hate.
joy|Good luck! Let ~~me~~us know how it goes!
neutral|Yep, she's completely isolated. Part of the abuse.
neutral|And then if you don't go out and actually sin, you've done nothing wrong.
joy|What a deliciously glorious rant. I suspect he is not alone in his opinions.
joy|Try your luck with ranked. it you stick it out enough you'll get high enough to play with good players
joy|No I am still friends with the person I value his friendship he can just be...judgy?
neutral|[NAME] is soft as hell boi got bullied in Minnesota
surprise|Wonder what [NAME] [NAME] thinks about all this
joy|I havent done a full rewatch since the finale. I think I might be ready
joy|FUCKING RIGHT COLIN WHITE AND OF COURSE MARK STONE
neutral|Hands to the back
neutral|hard working, alpha male, jackhammer, merciless, insatiable
anger|"Laughing at ""indoctrinated by traditional values"". Good luck in life."
fear|I’ve massively improved but it never really gets cured. There are always situations that will give you anxiety.
joy|In Rainbow is super amazing album as well.
neutral|[NAME] sub, dolphins sub, and [NAME] subs are having a field day right now lol same old jets
joy|Your heart stopping is technically a natural cause.
surprise|"How about texts between them? ""On my way home."" ""Ok, see you soon."""
joy|I'm not too excited to see [NAME] and [NAME] throwback offense again. Run 3 times punt and play great defense. Zzzzzz.
fear|Is this a real thing? I'm a terrible stoner.
neutral|Probably also saves money. An extra 3 napkins you dont use each time multiplied by thousands of people per day adds up quick
neutral|Idk why you’re getting down voted I also pick it every time and almost always get it done on that initial skirmish
joy|Congrats! How long was the journey? Did you stick with [NAME] the entire time?
neutral|[NAME]? never met one those.
neutral|>Pri*toiletries*
neutral|Is [NAME] okay?
neutral|Not when you compare it to CW though.
disgust|My dad wears that sweater every game day! It’s in much worse condition however
joy|I like the way you think!
joy|Oh. So you are actually full of shit. Okay, noted. Thanks.
surprise|Why cinnamon powder instead of bark?
surprise|Why? I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone not like [NAME] irl or here. Witten I can see though.
neutral|You could always try the too faced born this way foundation. It has 40 shades now and it’s hydrating.
neutral|fat people want to be oppressed so badly. I guess it's because they need an excuse to emotionally eat.
joy|[NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME] podcast is great.
sadness|No one ever laid on their death bed and said, “I regret not working even harder.”
surprise|Is this about [NAME]?
joy|Also since so many are forgoing children or having fewer the is less needed to purchase very large homes.
joy|Thanks for understanding
neutral|BCH has mostly stopped doing this too. No one who matters fell for it.
joy|Funny thing is, I got mine today. Maybe it'll stop tonight?
anger|They have a huge problem with rich freaks diddling kids, that's pretty libertarian.
neutral|here's a nice little introduction video for
disgust|that’s awful🤣🤣
joy|People have gotten triggered on this sub the past month if you didn't call [NAME] a [NAME], so I think we can handle it.
neutral|And motherf'ing crack!
disgust|Stop being disgusting. I dont know if you know this but all dogs are naked.
surprise|Have you guys played Vancouver recently or has [NAME] found someone else to cut his hair?
joy|Also pretty fantastic in Good Girls Revolt

anger|Goddamn. I'd tap the fuck out if I was that other guy.
joy|Thanks for this video. It was just what I needed
joy|**LET’S GO HAWKS!!!**
joy|It's honestly the best news I've heard all season.
surprise|I can't imagine buds being very hard to find in Hawaii
joy|Hopefully he gets traded
neutral|I already told him off and typing the number into Facebook came back with a whole bunch of nothing.
neutral|Excuse me?
joy|I don't think you can really go wrong with any of them, but I would suggest to watch him against South Carolina this year.
joy|but you won't hear that from most of the press or people on this sub WHAT IS THEIR POLICY THOUGH lmao
joy|A friend calls this shadow work. I think you're right. It takes a lot of courage and persistence.
anger|You know it’s bad when you grab the toothpaste and start reading it
surprise|Who was it? I got here after it was deleted, and I'd like to read the comment history.
surprise|On reflection I might've been harsh on [NAME], but Bandai's existence was forgettable like a swing flashback in Naruto.
surprise|I'm surprised that this is still happening despite the threats of an invasion of manbij.
neutral|And then everyone clapped
joy|I have little to no anxiety and it really helps me when i have to take a test.
joy|Thanks for the P.S
surprise|This cheat... what would that be? I may have made a choice I'm currently regretting.
surprise|Didn't that used to be the Northern Bank building? Never been troubled by pickpockets in Bangor but probably because I looked too poor!
neutral|BALL DONT LIE.
joy|> People on the team needs to be cool. yup, totally 2016(my csgo trading days) in a straight line.
joy|The Ethical code of conduct. However it's subjective in many instances. But its based on impairment
neutral|Goodbye my tank commander!
joy|It would be a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
surprise|It's pretty obvious why they're filming dipshit
anger|What the frick. I ordered a x box card
neutral|[NAME] is his ex.
fear|"Tranlated: Wooooo be afraid of the spooky ""shadowban"" so don't do the thing that gets your message to a wider audience. Smh"
surprise|My mom sent it to me so I knew it was bad but I didn’t realise it was already here
neutral|Downshifting in a manual to accelerate quicker
surprise|I honestly miss [NAME]
joy|Thanks for the advice I really appreciate it and I hope you're doing better now!
joy|That dad must love monster high as well.
neutral|I’m curious what is their concern and their purpose to be plus-size people influencers regarding the fact that they do not belong to that group?
anger|Watching [NAME] flip his head back every poke of contact is possibly the most frustrating thing to watch
neutral|Also them dealing with mean and petty people especially in school
neutral|"Okay. I mean 18% of the words in the comment you replied to were ""Times"", but okay"
joy|Street Samurai Koji and Ojiisan Koji are my personal favorites. Greased Lightning Koji is pretty fun as well.
joy|THIS!!
sadness|That was my mistake. It should only show your First Name and The 1st letter of my last name.
anger|Hasn’t hurt me none
neutral|They never seem to think this when the police arrive, with their guns, to end a terrible situation.
anger|Honestly, if you did not, then you were watching the video incorrectly.
joy|This is why I love politics. It really shows how stupid people are.
joy|Good point, thank you for the correction
joy|I appreciate it my guy! I try my best to really do research behind my opinions so I appreciate the call out.
neutral|Not sure what makes me a nimby but ok?
joy|Interesting user name :).
neutral|^ but she ain’t a traitor
joy|Try to think a bit harder.
neutral|No, because asses that hot don't come in trenta
anger|Chi snowing. Can't get a break.... Also I'm crushing it.
neutral|Most non immigrants won't do farm work for peanuts either
neutral|Shaming men for trying to solve a problem on their own is actually an example of toxic femininity
sadness|Calm down snowflake. Comment stalking from a week ago is really sad, especially when you're whining about something that I'm 100% right on.
anger|It really sucks people are downvoting you just because they were worried about blowing themselves up just like us nova bomb users.
neutral|Downvote. These slippers cute as hell.
joy|Ah fair enough. Thanks for elaborating
joy|Tough times don't last tough people do... Die'n is easy, living isn't, make the best of it
joy|thats even scarier haha
neutral|He may be jealous that you were able to do so
joy|Omg yes lol it’s the story of my life
disgust|[NAME] is always the dirtiest psychopath
joy|Was looking for this comment, thank you! Every so often someone will freak out over dilated pupils and post a pic here
neutral|“I use to work here and I remember our policy was this!” Did I nail it?
joy|Wow, that's crazy. Ever tried DMT?
surprise|Isn’t it the worst feeling ever?
joy|It did! Good luck on yours!! -[NAME]
joy|Feels good getting a number next to our name again.
neutral|Dont mind him/her, they have decided that anything which kinda speaks against the whole Apartheid is to blame for everything for the next 150 Years is bad.
joy|3 under 3?! You are a true hero.
sadness|Iirc she's alive but an alcoholic.
joy|would love to see a win here
surprise|Wow. Did not realize [NAME] was a top 20
joy|Yep! The artist also has one where he's plowing a blue Incineroar and it's one of the best things I've seen.
joy|More then a handful is to much anyways. You're all good lady. Confidence is sexy
neutral|Evil spirit! Leave from this place and never return!!
disgust|[NAME] is such a disgusting champ to play against ....
neutral|"Part of me wants to say ""Yea, that happened."""
disgust|That and he’s sneaky dirty
joy|Gah sad high five. I tried once for a few weeks and will never try again. I need that support in my life.
anger|You played torb....... that’s why. Just kidding that’s really weird though
anger|So this is how democracy dies... With thunderous upvotes.
joy|Yes, I’m sure [NAME] biggest concern is New Japan getting criticism on Reddit.
surprise|Why do you keep going back the them? Why should care about hillbillies?
joy|The first sentence alone sums it all up 😂
neutral|He was only thrown in there so we could have [NAME] get heroically saved by him and so we would hate [NAME]
sadness|EDIT: wrong link sorry here’s the right one I hope
joy|I plan on being respectful lol. I hope he’s there.
neutral|tape up those laptop cams y’all
neutral|That amiibo addiction is real man....
joy|I'm doing my best to apply that. Thank you for commenting
joy|Good luck for everyone pronouncing [NAME] name. If he keeps scoring like this, i'll have fun listening some commentators around NHL.
anger|No I’m not
neutral|Some guy that I went to hs with 7 yrs ago but haven't seen him since.
anger|The username makes it even better, sucking a dudes toes, who is [NAME]. Man I'm jealous
anger|Hmmmm this is so familiar but I can't quite put my finger on DJEEEOOOWWWOBRRRRBRBRBRRGRRRRRRDRRRRRRJRHRRJRRERHRJRGRHRRJRHRHRBRJ
joy|I want someone to take me to the hospital
joy|We are by far the greatest team the world has ever seen, we are just having a rough patch.
surprise|That's the laziest bro I've ever seen
joy|I love [NAME] goggles.
joy|yea I was gonna say that looks pretty good to me
joy|The [NAME], a great bunch of lads
joy|I watched the CWC from the stadium and boy is he amazing.
joy|This is the greatest thing I've read in my entire life
joy|Best of luck in Cleveland, Plaw Dog!
neutral|You specifically believe that if a mortal sin is not confessed a person is damned.
joy|That’s awesome!
joy|She's married and I respect her family and husband too much.
anger|Huge office fan and I agree. [NAME] and [NAME] are annoying.
anger|Fuck [NAME] pai
sadness|I literally got the same bug
joy|I agree with your guy. Sex can sometimes improve with the adulterous partner, because he/she feels desired and sexy again.
joy|Someone get us a [NAME] version of the [NAME] nice lead meme!!!
neutral|He’s probably just getting stressed out that it is now getting dark and he lives in the countryside
sadness|That’s an insult!! To fecal matter.
neutral|Chicken and the egg argument. Gun companies don't donate to [NAME] *because* they have gun control on their platform. This goes back decades mind you.
joy|I have to cuddle my dog so hard right now.
joy|People on Reddit barely know anything about law but they love to get riled up about the little that they do know
joy|I admit I’ll be fairly happy if we continue to invest in young internationals and sign a $100+ mil free agent every offseason.
anger|Any rap song because I hate it
neutral|BERNIE OR BUST
sadness|Before the trade happened I knew [NAME] was [NAME] but [NAME] beauty had not reached me yet
fear|That’s horrible. What country? If you don’t mind. My [NAME] was abused by her heavily religious (Pentecostal) father.
neutral|I thought they held hands while they and [NAME] were watching TV ([NAME] was pretending to be sick in that episode)?
surprise|I wondered where the quote about “supporting your azz” and was very pleased to finally find the train wreck that said it.
anger|Reacting to [NAME] at this point just makes me feel worse about the artist.
joy|Ok, thank you and thanks for the LPT. Cold leftover food is great sometimes like cold pizza, cold meatballs, etc...
surprise|What's up with all the gloating.
joy|[NAME] x [NAME] sounds cute for some reason.
joy|Thanks, now every highlander I run into tries to do it 100% of the time and I just bait them into a light parry
joy|I know man, however in some ways it's a good way to act out a martyr complex.
anger|> punishment for saying no to rape Surely if you wanted to rape someone you'd have to punish them for saying yes...
neutral|Weird, I checked again and it works for me now. It wasn't the first few times I tried to click.
joy|Thank you for the detailed response. It’s about time I worry about making myself happy rather than them.
joy|Used to love Thai-tanic. Haven't been in ages.
joy|"republicans and their hatred of Nordic countries are hilarious. ""Oh no some place has a much higher standard of living than us let's bash it!"""
joy|These aren't [NAME]... they're [NAME] that like to pose in the form of a hexagram for some reason
joy|Yeah, I was thinking they would be super cute with black heels and a snug black crop top.
neutral|What is up with the phone tho
joy|I like Shred 415
neutral|So you’re telling me [NAME] hasn’t got a baby face?
anger|[NAME] gets a lot of unfair criticism. [NAME], too
joy|Sending you some Ramona wine as thanks!
joy|[NAME] taking a backseat this episode but it sounds like he'll join the fray once [NAME] goes completely crazy.
anger|What the hell was that
anger|You are fucking retarded
joy|To be fair, I will also continue to jerk off to pictures of [NAME] in shorts He looks so good in them
neutral|Seinfeld is one of the only pieces of culture that I feel like I could be competitive in a trivia league about.
anger|Filthy birdbrain-loving scum barely deserve the bullets needed to boot them off the mountain. Moreiya 4 life
joy|Yes! I binged it (I was a late adopter) and then all of a sudden nothing!
neutral|[NAME] was awful last season. Let's sign [NAME] instead.
surprise|Lost finger how?
joy|Bahahahahaha the life of a fish parent!
neutral|He killed... YOUNGLINGS
surprise|Swear i have seen this before? had it been reposted?
joy|Lol.... i guess your personal experience explains everything.... personally I've seen this play out numerous times in the work place..... so.....
anger|Super unflattering. [NAME] is not overweight but this ensemble made her appear chunky.
joy|Wow that's a really great explanation. Makes sense!
anger|Your manager sounds like an idiot. Not saying he/she is. Just sounds like it from this.
surprise|Do you have any tinder picture or bio advice? I have no selfies or mirror pics but still not doing very well
surprise|Wow, season 3 is actually out already. Need to check it out
joy|Am interested in responses as I'm in a similar situation, though my tech school is a TDY
neutral|You're easily as classist as her.
sadness|"My adopted daughter told me, ""You can't tell me what to do. You're not my dad."" While true, it still stung."
joy|Thanks for the kindness; it’s all good enough- I’m hoping to move out later this year
joy|i did, but it was at 3 am before i went to bed, so i’m gonna cheat and count it as 2018 LOL.
neutral|I find it telling that a very known Russian media uses [NAME] as an exemple....
sadness|I’m so sorry the internet has inconvenienced you
joy|You should have gone and joined her for a drink.... That’s my dream... Eventually sit down and enjoy a drink with my siblings.
surprise|who tf has twitter on light mode
surprise|I mean everyone already knows what u like so its gonna be weird
joy|I love many fanarts of this paring, but this is one of my favorite ones. :)
joy|That's the worst feeling haha
anger|No. It’s slower and takes more calculation but it can be done. That’s why it should be practiced.
anger|Please dont put words into my mouth.I never said rape isnt a problem.
surprise|Why would they stop there with like 15 feet of visibility? It clearly isn’t just the truck drivers fault
joy|agreed....seems that due to plot force shes starting to slip
neutral|Fortunately, finding yourself and deepening your spiritual connection with the world only takes about 4 days in a beach hut with a thatched roof.
neutral|they do poorly making me feel otherwise
neutral|Now, can you make another applet to change his wallpaper?
joy|I did and found it basically the same except I was getting drunk very easily.
neutral|Weird, though. So many people love to identify themselves by their corporate loyalty.
joy|Thanks, I love it.
anger|Ok, thats my thinking too. If [NAME] really only gets 180 anyone who didn't make that deal (like us) is pretty dang foolish.
neutral|Highgate Hill! Close to westend and has a lot of cute houses. :)
joy|Right now I’d have to say [NAME] new restaurant UB Preserve is my favorite place to eat. So good.
joy|Haha i have 2 chinchillas from a manic episode about 8 years ago. They're sweet little things.
joy|I think she has a good chance
neutral|Henlo little alligatrr. ou almost slipped there. OH FUK NO NO NO NO ALIGATRR PLZ DONT EET MEEEEEEEE
anger|I'll look into it! I don't mind language but misogyny can be pretty intolerable
joy|His entire face is covered by a beard and sunglasses lol
joy|PLANT LOCAL WILDFLOWERS!!!! They come back year after year and the Pollinators will Love it.
joy|Totally agree with you. Just saying that [NAME] is not a stupid person. A smart person that will be spending the rest of his life in prison
anger|"You can't post a Sons pic and then say ""I got this"", that just hurts."
joy|Yes - thank you for stating it this way - perfectly said.
joy|Congrats!!! Happy for you.
neutral|Pretty sure the legislature needs to change laws
joy|Oh dear, I'm so sorry you are going through this. I don't have any sage advice but I hope things get better for you.
joy|Yeah this is pretty eye opening. I’ve had pretty weird relationships with my reflection in the past but thankfully it’s not always this way.
joy|Nope, from Nebraska why? Lmao
joy|Terrorism is the systematic use of violence to achieve a political goal. [NAME] has not used violence.
neutral|TIL I learned there are no drugs or violent incidents in prisons.
joy|It's finally official, we got [NAME]
surprise|"If you know it's the right thing to do, it's better to ""lose"" that person than to ""lose"" that opportunity."
joy|Thanks for posting this OP. Many times people change their minds and do the right thing but unfortunately we don't hear about it.
anger|My feelings exactly. First thought, a sarcastic 'Thanks.'
joy|the most romantic thing that can possibly happen to me
sadness|Every day in everyway. If I am to happy with anything next thing I know I'm actively destroying it.
neutral|[NAME] doesn’t roll his ankle on a 🎾 in 2011 and we win a premiership imo
neutral|True. Icing all three of your villains for the duration of the film is a bad idea. They need to be making moves.
neutral|2 more trae assists pls another 3 would be delightful as well
joy|So happy for you :)
surprise|"BT In the commentary booth: ""Where's your god [NAME]?"" As she's being mauled by a lion"
sadness|It’s a facepalm just for the wrong reason
neutral|"Because there's such a thing as ""too good to be true"" and some people are still skeptical of that."
neutral|He seemed like he was about to run away and go do some meth.
sadness|Don't know how that was missed. Tragic really. Considering the title.
fear|I’m just worried about his attitude and approach with younger players. Edit-re worded
joy|This is really well put. I saved it.
joy|Thank you. ❤️ I really appreciate your comment
joy|I've seen so many of these and I still have a massive amount of difficulty believing it is possible.
joy|Why so much green though lol
joy|Unemployed now re: those crummy health issues. So that probably helped.
joy|Sounds fun from what I’m reading on here.
neutral|"Just wait till they see what British capitalists have in store for them now we got ""arr soverinity"" back"
neutral|I carry on an empty. But I also carry a single action. So don't make my mistakes.
joy|I understand that but I enjoy the silence and lonely feeling I have.
surprise|Is it Amazon brand? Genuine question as I didnt even know those existed
neutral|He'd have to ask his mom
neutral|And you got it, a federal tax cut. If you want to pay less taxes overall you need to stop electing democrats.
anger|No, I have been avoiding doing anything until it's actually fixed because I don't want to give them any reason to drag their feet.
joy|I think most people have listened to bohemian rhapsody at some point thank you very much
neutral|We didn't screw it up!
surprise|I wouldn't say age would stop it just lessen the affect of it but probably start to notice it around mid to late 30's.
sadness|You should be embarrassed. Not only because you are a adulterer but because you are a pedo for thinking of your son.
joy|Most likely. If he falls to our 3rd round pick ,I think we should definitely take him.
joy|I don’t know why but watching this makes me super happy!
anger|They don’t like to be excluded from anything
fear|One of my worst nightmares. Ugh.
anger|Don't kink shame

joy|I’m gonna need to see that in writing before I celebrate.
neutral|You didnt!
neutral|Ironic, since cleaning your room is what [NAME] is always on about.
surprise|WHAT IS HAPPENING
anger|Your point? That doesn't mean it had 2 of EVERY FREAKING LAND MAMMAL on it!
joy|Sending love and strength vibes <3
surprise|I tried Guinness the other week and it made me gag, what’s different about it to other beer
joy|I just saw this on netflix..... Now I'm Watching it... Then you post this.... It's like we almost watched it together...
joy|Don't underestimate him, he can do it in 2
joy|I wish I was [NAME]. Source (deleted):
neutral|He also had bipolar depression, which was a major driver in his mental states...
joy|Falcons fan here. I love you guys so much.
joy|While I agree with you for the most part, I also have cats and upholstered furniture.

surprise|Care to share your thought process ?
disgust|My poor space bar takes an awful bashing with all the pausing in a Squidge vid
joy|Not sure if very professional image journalist or avid porn enthusiast but good job all the same!

neutral|The problem is complex but in the 60's til now we where facing major propaganda against marijuana and this stuck to the head of most poeple.
joy|I think this is the clearest that it has ever been described. Thank you for this. It nailed it, for me anyway....

anger|I hate these memes because [NAME] never cared if he did or didn't have a nose.
neutral|And look like big tracts of land.
surprise|The miracle was just that. Because we all know the Vikings would fail the next game.
neutral|Big ol fesh
joy|No problem, glad to help.
anger|Honestly you should have gone nuclear on him
joy|I love [NAME] and how openly she is in supporting him to run
surprise|How many hours of maintenance do they really need to do every night? I feel like they just want to cut costs and tell us it's impossible.
neutral|Possible maybe, not at all plausible.
joy|Organizational Change Manager and I fucking love it and have for 7 years. Still enjoy going to work every day.
anger|Wow he is... ugly.
joy|I love you like a love song, baby. And if you know that song, it's now in your head.
neutral|I would focus on being an enlisted Marine first. That’s what you’ll be doing for the next 4 years.
joy|its funny because they dont even do anything at the look out tower but stargaze
surprise|Am i missing something or is this an antijoke that doesn't belong here?
anger|He's always had the tools to do this, which is why he can be frustrating at times.

neutral|So much to do, So much to see
surprise|Intelligence is to know the difference between MB and Mbps. Wisdom is to not be a cunt about it.
neutral|Wrong, it's not 365 days a year. Once every four years, it's 366 days a year.
neutral|#LIES. NO STACY CAN BE A GAMER. #RISE UP
joy|Consider this a digital hug. Not too long, not too short, just enough to make you feel a human connection and some comfort. :)
joy|Thanks for sharing. You could definitely post some of your other tales.
anger|We're not exactly short on white homophobes either though.
surprise|Whats your height and weight out of curiosity?
neutral|Gotta get 'email all! Edit: stupid autocorrect
joy|Rule 10 is to make it clear that people who violate the spirit of the rules without breaking the letter will be punished in the same way.
surprise|"I honestly don't understand why everyone thinks he needs a rework because he's not ""fun to play"" in the worst game mode."
joy|Really good point here. Thanks.
surprise|Is that bottom trey filled with beer? If so, how did he acquire them?
fear|Of course he will lie cheat and steal to make him self relevant to the public. Horrible person.
joy|Id rather have them be physically ok and make amends with [NAME] later than have one without the ability to communicate efficiently forever but have their feelings alright.
neutral|You're cool
neutral|No problem. If you read it let me know what you think!

neutral|"""I SAID, [NAME]!"""
anger|[NAME] is a hungry little bastard.
surprise|I had no idea it would hit me as hard as it did. It really changed my view.
neutral|His best season was a luck filled one. He'd be nothing more than what [NAME] and [NAME] already offer but with worse defense and a worse bat.
joy|Meh, it just keeps players from diving in taking stupid damage. (At least it should.)
joy|I’d love an ג׳‬וליאן if you have time! Good job keep up the hard work
joy|Attempt to con the senate. This should continue to be entertaining
anger|It’s not satisfying at all. If this wasn’t [NAME] it wouldn’t be popular. Interesting timing considering the [NAME] debacle too.
joy|Same boat here, man.
joy|What a baby...
neutral|Yeah I think it largely depends on how you fall. In Judo that’s one of the main things they practice.
neutral|And it needs to keep pushing harder and harder to the left in order to wash away all the crap that's been enacted since [NAME] got into office.
neutral|Actually there were blacks in the SS. Kind of an odd analogy.

neutral|AA is BS as a whole. Meritocracy or GTFO.

neutral|i know the feeling dude
joy|> His face, mate. He thought he was a goner. Properly lol'd at that and reading all [NAME]' bits in his accent

anger|Fucking hell they're bringing on all the giants
joy|Weird flex, but ok
disgust|Definitely fake. Looks like bad CGI in a movie.
neutral|Or better yet, on the woman who will let ME play with them!

sadness|Oh my gosh. This woman who died also had a son who died. Holy tragedy
neutral|And people still support him....

joy|This isn't really petty, it's actually brutal. *edit* but well done. I love it!
neutral|It was squirting all over my kitchen n the nurse. Who then said oh nicked an artery.

anger|Love the gif but I bloody hate these kinds of captions. It's as annoying and cringey as a fully grown adult doing baby-talk.
