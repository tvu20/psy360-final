joy|Thanks nate. If you need any help any time or support I'm here for ya.
neutral|I sure could have used that during nursing home rotations .
joy|Me too. Sweet!

joy|I love Big Brother, they make an appointment and come pick up used household goods and clothes. Easiest way to donate.

neutral|Dogs get itches every now and then and use the ground to scratch it out. But usually it's on dirt not asphalt.
joy|Thanks, I'll do that next time. I didn't mean to get blood on it after all.
joy|Give it time. Pain like that needs to heal just like open wounds. I really hope that you will eventually start to feel better.

neutral|Just recked him, totally and utterly.
joy|Dude awesome job being the reading police, great work out there tonight. Keeping the streets safe.
neutral|Undoubtedly offensive goaltending on [NAME] here. Pistons got away with one.

joy|Thanks everyone for your feedback! Dosing one bottle tomorrow night around 8pm EST, will post back with results ü§†
sadness|But both lost, whereas moderate Sinema won. Its important because without Arizona there is no real path to Senate majority in 2020.
joy|I don't think you see it in the flames sub... if you do it's probably a joke
neutral|So what you're saying is, there actually won't be any roads in Ancapistan.
surprise|Did people really go against [NAME] when he came out? I wasn't as in to his stuff at the time but I remember people being supportive.
joy|This will pass and you will be happy again. Just not right now. Hang in there.
sadness|That game hurt.
surprise|Hitting your kids for punishment just makes them sneakier. Maybe that has something to do with the dishonesty of the church and [RELIGION] in general.
anger|AV is a system where if you vote for a loser you can change your mind and 'have another go'. That's the problem.
neutral|No. Everyone going through the temple that day -- living and for the dead -- all got the same name.

joy|"""[NAME] remains being [NAME]"" is absolutely perfect."
joy|Awesome! Thanks for your reply
joy|That's awesome. Hahaha
surprise|Wow either [NAME] misspoke or I didn't hear correctly. I swear he said chainsaw, that is totally different from knife or cooking accident.
neutral|>Pretty much as soon as he said he was going to work towards income equality he was killed. It wasnt for his civil rights work.
surprise|Why is there a huge focus on the living room? The perspective confused me so much.
surprise|What evidence at all shows that [NAME] was an accomplice?
joy|I feel like someone smart will go pound bama on the ML right now. But that person won‚Äôt be me lol.

joy|Nice post here, dork.
joy|I've recently figured out I'm the perfect mix of smart ass and sweet, the ladies love it.
joy|I would never tell anyone stick is better than pad, but speaking personally, it's way more fun
anger|Let them argue. We've never done anything remotely as bad as MOST OF THE WORLD does routinely.
neutral|Normally yes, but then it would be an attractive woman (at least it used to be).
neutral|.......... no u!
neutral|I know but it just sucks to feel like this
joy|He is and will be irrelevant. No worries.

neutral|Damn Blake is on fire today
surprise|Grew up in the south. When I left for college, I was very confused why people were walking around with smudges on their foreheads for Ash Wednesday.

neutral|Its just coming out now...
joy|Thanks I‚Äôm falling in love, and it‚Äôs also cost efficient!

sadness|Didn't really help who the Master is but [NAME] will lose his damn mind. We video game worlds now.
sadness|He has been given all the time/freedom in the world - he just doesn't deliver.

joy|"Also the sneezing. The dog is sneezing which is canine for ""this is a great game"""
neutral|I kind of liked that one song he did with [NAME]. I forgot the name though.
anger|Dude I have a verrrrry strong feeling the barber did that on purpose. Nowhere in the world is that an acceptable haircut. That‚Äôs fucked up
neutral|That's not how they decide things. It's a political entity like any other and other members exert pressure, there are compromises, etc.
sadness|It's sad that we have to think of it as a miracle and not a regular occurrence :/
neutral|The weak should fear the strong
neutral|About as odd as it is noticing a hockey players finger nails on tv
surprise|I wasn‚Äôt saying she was faking just curious to see her reaction to it
neutral|I don't want PR to vote because they'll vote blue. I want them to vote because they deserve the right to have representation.

joy|Great show honestly
joy|You look awesome in this picture
sadness|Again, that + is going to make people not want to do this deal.

joy|Omg that‚Äôs a perfect idea! I obviously want to avoid the stalker thing but I do love basketball and understand it so this seems possible

joy|Yeah that doesn't sound fun at all. I may just stick to the burbs.... Thanks for the reply.
anger|This qualifies as emotional neglect. Just, to be clear, that is a form of covert abuse and is not okay or normal.
anger|"At least he was polite - ""please"" fuck off! "
anger|Uhhhhhhhhh well that's not good
neutral|I guess without me you would just go on mistakenly thinking [NAME] was a part of the Dodgers ownership group.

joy|I will third Blues City Deli...the Prez [NAME] is ridiculous!
anger|This is a very cursed lineup
surprise|Where does this one person every 67 hours statistic come from?
joy|Salaam, these thoughts happen. It is the shaitan trying to divert you from the path. May [NAME] grant you patience and the steadfastness to protect yourself.

neutral|You already used that one my abusive buddy.
joy|Ah, the good old days where you could lose in a game! Yes!
joy|"I guess we didn't truly ""match"" but I saw the profile with the percentage of their calculated compatibility."

joy|Lmao imagine thinking rubbing a smelly oil on your face will make you grieve better

joy|I'm excited for them, but I can understand why anyone wouldn't be. They both use the fighting styles of characters who are already in the game
joy|I do this. Every. Single. Time.
neutral|The lying little slag. If you're squatting properly, turning your neck shouldn't be comfortable enough to consider
neutral|I preferred the old one that only made me want to gouge one eye out
joy|I enjoyed that [NAME] kept saying [NAME] last name wrong over and over.
sadness|I keep hearing [NAME] is a terrible hire.
joy|It tore off lol. The bracket isn‚Äôt installed on delivery.

joy|What a beautiful sight that was to behold. Glad I was able to attend a couple of great [NAME] performances. ‚ÄúK‚Äù signs everyone
neutral|I think thats the point, this screams irony. Like r/comedyheaven brand
neutral|Any AI controlled streak should just be banned from day 1, regardless of game. The fact that the pros haven't GAd them all blows my mind.
joy|She‚Äôs probably very traditional. Why haven‚Äôt you tried to kiss her yet?
sadness|Mauston and Monticello were the beginning and end of my hope
joy|That explains why the dude in the back reacts the way he does... thank you!
sadness|That was painful.
neutral|"We're all humans, why would a darker skinned [NAME] not be ""one of their own""?"
joy|I love it! Guy in front can steer, can't propel. Guy in back can propel, but can't steer.
joy|I believe this would still be a ticket if someone else sees you.
joy|Ah u/The_White_Baron... I didn't read all of it, but glad I know the reference now

anger|Idk if you ask most store managers they will say they started as a cart pusher Probably bullshit but still.....
fear|That‚Äôs scary
surprise|Are there a lot of people that defend [NAME]? I dunno I see it here and there but those people are considered idiots by most sane people.
fear|Threaten to release....welp , nothing coming from this.
fear|It‚Äôs pretty cringe
disgust|Pins are given out? My store hordes that shit like there‚Äôs a coming apocalypse and pins are the only thing that will save them.
neutral|Please! She‚Äôs my #1 choice. The rare mix of super likeable and hypercompetent. Like [NAME] mixed with [NAME].
joy|Wow. You have literally no idea how American politics works. It's almost as if you're either a bot or a troll.
joy|Thanks, I'll have a look and see what they offer
anger|BUT ATHEISTS ARE DOING THE SAME THING AND ARE TREATED BETTER. No. You're just being a bigot.
anger|Get the fuck out
sadness|The dude was absent in the Ohio State game... IDK I would be very worried if he was the pick.
neutral|I've only seen a handful of episodes, but we're supposed to believe that the FBI agent is so incompetent that he never finds out?
neutral|> and was getting blocked like crazy down low We talking about [NAME] now?
joy|"If [NAME] had served all fast food buffet to a football team Reddit would be circlejerking ""So down to earth and amazing!!1"""
anger|Also [NAME] raised money because so many of his subscribers are dumb enough to confuse an Indian company with the country of India.
joy|Don't worry, he won't be for long
joy|"""In valor, there is hope"""
neutral|Any particular reason or just because it seemed redundant?
sadness|Well poops. My friend and I want to wander and look for such things but we can't. Boo!

anger|I just don‚Äôt like traversing through the snow, and how the salt stains some of my boots, and the mess it leaves at home.

joy|[NAME] made boobi beautiful
anger|genji dmg buffs are eh but everything else except a nerf to zen are crazy
surprise|Why am I crying alone in my room rn
joy|I wanna see a video proving it's fake though
joy|Anarcho-capitalism is indeed a joke, yes
joy|[NAME] is a fantastic player, but would he be a regular starter over at Juve? He needs to stay at Arsenal.
anger|Who fucking cares. People have sex all the time. You're just an asshole for trying to to profit from it or ruin her.
surprise|I have no idea. That restaurant loves to put fried spaghettis everywhere.
neutral|you can tell she's insanely insecure by her body language and they way she poses for pics.
joy|Beautiful. Makes me wonder how the Persona 6 Velvet Room attendant will be like and how the dynamic with their siblings go...
joy|So his aunt? I think I followed that.
joy|great!! thank you
joy|And not all children's hospitals need the same stuff, so call and ask what they need. But I like your tip. You're correct.
neutral|That's not justification to keep doing it. Also this would be the purview of the Democratic party since it's the primaries we're talking about.
joy|Metallica recorded a congratulatory video for him, so effin cool:
neutral|The title of the post started playing this in my head
anger|You shut your stupid mouth troll. Thy absolutely matter
joy|Just cut it all of, you won‚Äôt look bad
joy|Not probable, I study in the best university in my country, I don't want to stop at all
neutral|Including the fact that once I pirate something, i usually will purchase it later on either through frustration / poor quality/ actually loving the product / etc

surprise|*What* exactly *are* we *italicizing* so *much* for?
joy|Lol you got nothing to worry bout from me bro. Thanks for keeping the game on
neutral|Incumbency only seems to matter in smaller states these days.
anger|[NAME] didn‚Äôt just fight dogs, he, personally, tortured them too. He isn‚Äôt a dog fighter, he is a sociopath.
neutral|No. Without getting into spoilers that ring is reserved for something else later in the game.
joy|Wrote some good poems too
joy|They are loving this choice in maga canada of course. Just a typical day of bigotry.

anger|Hell yea brother, Charlotsvile car attacker did nothing wrong Lets see how quick they scream hate speech
neutral|The automatic double action loophole.
anger|Serious question, where was this? That looks like my ex in the green top.
neutral|‚ÄúBigotry is when you disagree with me, and the more you disagree the more bigotryer it is‚Äù -[NAME]
neutral|This only makes me want him more. Proves he is decisive and has self belief. Our team has been devoid of both.
joy|Thank u goalie [NAME]
surprise|What happened ?!

neutral|Oh look, even a crazy nut gets a squirrel once and a while.

sadness|How embarrassing.
joy|Well I am happy you believe that.
surprise|Just curious...
neutral|Omg I thought it said it aired the 7th. I feel dumb. Ty.
neutral|Are you joking? 538 has him hovering around -15 net approval. He won‚Äôt win unless Dems nominate someone like [NAME] again at this rate.
anger|This post is a waste of time and doesn't belong here.
joy|You really don't allow children to come forward with bullying until they have video evidence? Lmfao

surprise|Scuba diving. I realized how truly precious and fragile nature is. I stopped eating seafood as well.
anger|I don‚Äôt want my tax dollars going to some psycho who thinks he‚Äôs a girl trapped in a mans body
anger|As far as I know, it's still bugged, so just reroll it
anger|Fuuuuck that's rough
joy|I have the same issue. Except I'm a dude. Talking about my face. One likes me scruffy, the other baby smoothe
neutral|yeqpnsaved one from every event in the history of hots, think I may have accidentally opened one of my summer boxes tho :s
sadness|I regret that I understand that reference :(
neutral|Literally any type of pepper, Bell, chilli etc. Pain in the arse but I‚Äôd rather limit my choices than have that allergic reaction again.
neutral|yeah, a little bit.
neutral|They don't care, even if that involves bringing any idiot in regardless what they tag along and other tenants have to suffer until or if they move.
joy|All armed robbers, serial killers, rapists, swindlers all downplay the severity of their actions...
joy|you still didn't answer the point....lol

neutral|I groped one of my friend's ass last year. I've had a gf. I have mostly A's.
neutral|[NAME] first event was IW, not last year. So you're comparing his second year playing professionals on LAN vs Cells first time.
anger|You said that it is a fact that [NAME] is a rapist based on the testimony of 1 person. I merely stated the same argument based on your logic.
neutral|It's very r/thathappened

neutral|And sitting on the side of the road for 8 hours to catch you doing 65 in a 55
neutral|[NAME] was high sticked 3 times, cut twice before a call
joy|[NAME] forced [NAME] to give it up, leading to a steal, and then gets a steal himself on the next play. Love his tenacity.
neutral|And the GOP will only care if they're boys.
joy|In that case you're very welcome to call your representative and tell them to agree to a bill which would reopen the government. Or tweet the president.
anger|It's also ridiculously removed from reality. Dying to a disease or injury from an accident is orders of magnitude more likely than getting shot.
joy|This person is the smartest person to play town of salem literally 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999991000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001234567898765432345676543345678987654345678909876543234567898765432345678909876543234567898765432345678987654323456787654345676543456543456434543434343434323456765434567654323454323456543345678987654323456789876565656565656565656565656565454545654565454323456765432345678765456 IQ

neutral|>I'm 8 years old in human years yeah, I'd bet
joy|Thanks friend, you have a good day! ([NAME] is fab btw just not quite [NAME] or [NAME] for me!)
joy|You shot well. UVA's defense wasn't that bad that game in all honesty. People underestimate the amount of luck involved in basketball, bottom line.
neutral|On [NAME], the allegations and the final result were very different. If I recall most of the complaints substance was rejected or disproven.
joy|Skiing is great but I haven‚Äôt been skiing yet this season rip
joy|It is actually out on the steam store right now.

disgust|Honestly, this would creep me out a bit.
neutral|wanting to kill other people doesn't? all i'm saying is, you wanna kill people - start with yourself.
joy|He's been cheered for years now.
neutral|Which makes no sense. [NAME] associate cheap prices with shit products (reason why Walmart was pushed out) but free shit is always just looked at as free shit.

joy|Yep, I guess this is a no-go for me. Thanks!
neutral|> PAYGO requires bills to be deficit neutral. Nope. 2.3 trillion over the first 10
anger|Nope, no deal far more likely to starve the country than U-boat blockade.

neutral|brick house nibbas assemble
joy|Yes, that might be a good thing
joy|I honestly can't imagine [NAME] using any kind of profanity lol
disgust|Worst case scenario here is he dodged a psychopathic bullet.

surprise|Yup, but I love wegman's so much, although I am curious as which one this is... I am guessing Jersey or DC area

anger|They're just misguided, useful idiots.
joy|I‚Äôd love to get an update on what happened! (When you are ready)

neutral|May the fleas of a thousand camels infest their armpits.
neutral|I saw that [NAME] page was already updated with head coach of AZ as well.

neutral|You are disregarding that the Iran hostage crisis happened just years early. Iran was public enemy number 2, second only to the Soviets.

joy|The BrokenMachine has one of these videos but I'm definitely going to watch yours. Thank you for taking the time to do this.
neutral|Beside the scene , the quality of the video was magnificent

neutral|">Turkish [NAME] You are right except ""[NAME]"" part. I could not found the attack but there was a [NAME] [NAME] who was involved.."
neutral|You cared enough to come on your alt to comment AGAIN. But you forgot to switch to the alt. Claiming you don't care is nothing special.
sadness|> It‚Äôd make porn ~~awkward~~ awesome FTFY
neutral|Yes in the right places as do bites, again they have to be in the right places.
neutral|I literally never said it costs that much a day. It was just a dumb guess. It's obviously more, mate.

anger|I didn‚Äôt know that. Gtk

joy|She's fine but she's no [NAME].
joy|I'm going to pretend this question was asked in all honesty, and upvote. Besides the answer below is great.
joy|Cute. I hope it makes you feel empowered.
neutral|It's just projection..they can't take a joke so they think no one else can either.
neutral|>by highschool you know what is and what isn't socially acceptable ... Since when?
neutral|When I can see them while a call it's okay it's only when they stand in front of me
sadness|They've done this before. Look the Order of the White Feather up, it was worse.
neutral|Doesn't change too much. A delayed bribe would still be a bribe.
sadness|i‚Äôm so sorry.....
anger|Because idiots in this sub care too much about what other people have on their screen? It only tells me that too many people on here are narcissists.
sadness|Sorry, but [NAME] doesn‚Äôt even compare to [NAME].
joy|Happy cake day
neutral|I remember that day, and I remember the disgraceful convention.
joy|Lol ok. So saying a garbage clip doesn't belong at the top of a gaming subreddit makes me a [NAME].

neutral|I've seen [NAME] at the bars in Huntington a couple times and every time I see her I buy her a drink.

joy|Wow! Never thought of it this way but that's a REALLY good point.
neutral|(insert [NAME] meme) THEFT?!
anger|These aren‚Äôt /u/ These are just their nicknames. They‚Äôll know who they are when they read it and that‚Äôs what matters.
joy|[NAME] in Richardson gets my love.

joy|I'm three months old and I love Queen and Metallica, not the crap my generstion listens too.
neutral|I will admit I see why some people could hate him, but each to their own.
neutral|The train conductor didn't kill anyone. There's nothing that person can to but watch. So it's a lot easier to believe.
joy|Some people just don't understand humor. Imagine living your life like that!
neutral|Yeah that's how someone died at Dour festival when swimming in the stone quarry :/
neutral|Why cant I ever see these comments linking things until the day AFTER i make my comment
joy|No, treating it like it‚Äôs obligatory just means it‚Äôs a standard I have. People are allowed to have standards.
joy|I love it, I understand they can't just get rid of [NAME] for her, but I would be so angry watching [NAME] boss her around.
joy|You are correct.
neutral|If they effect you differently they should be treated differently. If they both make it dangerous or otherwise.
neutral|When he shoved them.
joy|About as serious as my plans to marry a porn star and retire to the Bahamas.
neutral|R1/L1, always played like this R2/L2 feels weird and slow
joy|I schedule reading breaks during the day. It allows me time to relax if I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed, but is still beneficial for the kids.
surprise|What a trainwreck

anger|dude people here can be assholes. there‚Äôs nothing wrong with taking a break.
joy|Great subterfuge guys
sadness|I‚Äôm sorry Mr. [NAME]
anger|Never understood the hype with the Beatles. All of their songs to me sound like unfinished demo tracks

sadness|I've read the series through 4 times. There is literally zero reason to believe that.
neutral|READ THE FAQ
surprise|Why not just bring the county governments back? Let them decide where to establish regionalized schools.
joy|But funny, and that absolves the sin!
fear|So edgy.
neutral|People are often too afraid to speak out against the status quo though.
neutral|Maybe the dog wasn't on a leash the last time...
disgust|Puppies in 95% of cases. Sorry but some dogs are ugly no matter how old they are.

joy|Hahaha. One of those rare moments when a reddit title makes me laugh out loud.
joy|Wow so glad [NAME] is getting it done quicker. Better for later in tourney

joy|So did mine! And I'm now one myself. Sending a trillion hugs and props to you!

joy|You know what you‚Äôre right, not with risking my CC info. Good thing I was too lazy to do it right away.
sadness|Im so sorry

anger|No but it would be weird if you masturbated to it like I did
neutral|You should dm her and say I'm sorry

joy|Funny thing, I work at a restaurant and it happened today, which is what pushed me to post this.
anger|Yeah. I killed them both.
neutral|I ride our half-orc barbarian by clinging to his back. He hasn't seemed to notice yet.

joy|Lol seriously. I mean Vardos was really cool but other than that the story was so bland and predictable.

joy|Well. That's your belief. I know you and the next cant tell me how to raise mine so I'm not worried about all that.

joy|[NAME] and [NAME] made their own beds with their own actions. But I agree with this too .

anger|Bloody Peasant!

anger|I don't think that's true. Every major story I remember from the [NAME] investigation has been from court documents.

fear|Tear all of it down - that place is such a horrific example of trash civil engineering
sadness|Sadly the same way know people who know people and being in public. Maybe an online game with chat like league or xbox

neutral|I‚Äôd crap myself if that happened to me.
neutral|The Volvo driver is calling his lawyer...
joy|Thank you! Happy New Year, hopefully it's a good one
joy|True. I think the only way vegan lab-grown meat could be produced is via self-renewing stem cells which is still a very undeveloped technology
neutral|[NAME] aside, humans arent on the menu, no matter how retarded they may be, no matter if they're sleeping/unconscious.
joy|... with my stepmom. Haha. Erm.
neutral|[NAME] just has to wait a few hundred years
neutral|It'd seem weird being around a handful of other players and literally everyone has a pet dog
neutral|Yes, it does.
joy|For what it's worth, I hope you have a great year anyway.
joy|As long as the stop watch on my iPhone is timing him, my kid will do almost any chore. Its crazy what kids find exciting
joy|I mean you can want a break from something and still enjoy it.
neutral|Just because you would laugh, doesn't mean that the guy in the video would.
anger|Fuckin Finnish spitz out there bud
anger|jokic with a couple dumb arm fouls already, he seems a tad unsettled
joy|Nice, but everyone deserves the best.
joy|Haha. Fucking banana stand. Didn‚Äôt realize people actually used them.
sadness|Weird, Tuxedo Mask looks shorter and pudgier than I pictured him to be
joy|Seriously, I‚Äôve never had rendering problems (External SSD) until now... Not even on the PTR
surprise|Sorry, I have plans that day, week, month. Watching TV while you peruse Reddit are plans aren't they???
joy|fantastic point!
joy|Sure, but I don‚Äôt think those costs outweigh [NAME] getting caught in crossfire on Queen Street.
disgust|Disgusting, but fascinating.
joy|That was my wish in writing this. We all need hope sometimes. Some enchanted evening comes for each of us in its own time I think.
anger|Lmfao I'm not here to Google easy shit for morons.
anger|FBI OPEN UP!!!!
neutral|Only had 1 line to worry about and they did all the damage
neutral|So if MB3 replaces WCS, who exactly do you see as the future for your forward spots?
neutral|Either you're stupid or complicit. I don't care either way.
joy|Thanks for the gold
neutral|[NAME] is the trashy lady stuck shopping at a Macy‚Äôs in your local mall
neutral|When are the Blackhawks going to play again games that matter? :(
joy|This is one of my favorite threads ever.
joy|You‚Äôre the best grandmother a person could hope to have.
fear|yikes, as someone who dislocates things often ([NAME]), this scares me!
neutral|MY DADDY SAID THE CIVIL WAR WUZ ABAOT STATE RIGHTS AND HE'S THA BEST BROTHUR I EVER HAD
sadness|Yes, sorry reddit told me 2 times a error occured while posting this :/ Looks like it got submitted fine tho :/
neutral|I'm 31 and didn't even have my first cell phone, period, until I was 20. This is just more anthropological fake news.
neutral|We left the church, but it'll probably take awhile for him to unlearn all the bullshit
anger|Oh no! I'll check into it; there are transcripts available, but it isn't really the same thing, is it?
neutral|"""I can read again and again if I want to ""talk"" to him again"" - my dude that brought tears. "
joy|I'm impressed! After childbirth, I'm lucky to make it twelve minutes without having to pee...
neutral|I just find it very strange that someone would have a child in a relationship where they had felt unloved for years.
joy|Wrong on so many levels. Just sit back and watch it implode. It will hurt at first, but guarantee, you will have the last laugh.
joy|This is genius. The ultimate prank.
joy|Agree! 60 new shoppers in Columbus I think is why. I removed Chillicothe and all those once but they came back. I am not going there!
sadness|I've been playing this game since release and didn't even know that!
neutral|Oh, I ripped one üòâüçÅüî•üòóüí®‚òÅÔ∏èüíØ‚òÅÔ∏èü§ôüèª
neutral|Alright guys I got next on the repost
joy|Is that her official name now? [NAME]
joy|Ya. It's not what you think to start. Awesome show ending within 5 seasons with a planned ending. It's refreshingly hilarious. Netflix available.
joy|I cried I was laughing so hard
neutral|I don't know. I really don't know. Rest assured, it probably won't reproduce.
surprise|You're not from America, are you? Bless your pure soul <3
joy|I might be having carrot cake tonight!!! I love it! And that coffee sounds like the perfect pair! Enjoy it
joy|Happy cocaine on a plate day!
sadness|I wish I could forget. Stop reminding me :(
sadness|Done and done in the memory of [NAME]. I am sorry for your loss.
fear|There‚Äôs this which is terrifying to think about
sadness|Oh man, you got me there with the image
joy|You're a big guy.
neutral|and they‚Äôll be 100 percent right
neutral|I do that with chili...
neutral|Every time I get a distinct *[NAME]* vibe. A bunch of savage children devoid of compassion and understanding.
anger|Unread. Unworthy of my or anyone else‚Äôs attention. You‚Äôll have to hate alone today, [NAME].
joy|I love you [NAME], you is my only friend.
joy|Much appreciated comrade!
surprise|I realized that. Why I jokingly said they were messing with you. Didn't think you actually spoke with them.
joy|Crap company that old folks love cause of the name Only useful benefit is towing
joy|Lmao I listen to stuff that doesn't fit in any of these categories Oh, and grandson
neutral|Yes YES #YES
joy|Yes. Exactly. Anything non [NAME] belongs in the trash. Glad you agree.

neutral|[NAME] did a job for us
fear|You're a horrible person.
joy|It's all out of love... We promise.
joy|I can do the very first part, where he first jumps.
surprise|Wonder if some of the ‚Äòcuse guys we got because nobody was available anymore will be cycled out
joy|Hey nice rebuttal. I got some new information out of that, thanks for that. It's all about learning.
surprise|I guess learning French in school helped me for once
neutral|Well I guess Blazers lose cause they're down? :(
surprise|Used to be the November curse!
joy|good job with being proactive with mental health.
anger|Hilariously wrong and uncontroversial.
joy|Thanks, dude. It means a lot : ) Hope you have a great week.
joy|I remember that one. I to found a special fondness for vacuums after that.
surprise|Power trip blindness is scary; how someone can't see the obvious aftermath of acting like this with their employees?
anger|Yeeesss...... let the anger flow through you...
joy|I would make sure I didn‚Äôt leave any soda cans anymore so I could have the high ground, and then hide all but one cup lol
sadness|Wait is this a euphemism for ditching your husband and finding a new partner or did you lose 179 pounds?!?!
sadness|Really!? I thought it had, or at least it should. Guess I'm better off leaving too
neutral|I really can‚Äôt understand why adopting a baby would not be perfect for them. But that might be because I dont have the child-need myself.
neutral|BOOP! Go Stars!
neutral|I think they were talking about the learning proccess. [NAME] succeded as well. So, 3 of them.
anger|That's not how it works
surprise|> The headline writers are misrepresenting her words (second publication I have seen in minutes that has done so). Oh wow I wonder why
neutral|Yeah I thought presses when I seen those too.
anger|I didn't have an umbrella and got wet but it's so damn humid still it's all stanky feeling outside.
joy|We'll try this... I love you man. Whoever you are I know you're good. Most of us are.
joy|yeah, thanks
joy|This is beautifully written.
joy|The kind look on his face certainly helps
joy|> it‚Äôs a low f-ing bar lbr It is indeed. But I am glad that you found a man who doesn't want anal.
surprise|is [NAME] coming back?
anger|"""I shouldn't have done that, it's not the honorable way."""
joy|Hahaha I was gonna put one of those but I couldn‚Äôt remember what they were
joy|This definitely sounds like bipolar mania or a schizophrenic episode. I hope he gets some help.
joy|Plus she's probably going through some extreme grief, life insurance is a huge practical concern for her right now.
neutral|We should have been doing this for years.... The reservations people had/have against the use of stem cells held us back for far too long.
sadness|I had to mute cause the sound was making me cry.
neutral|The problem I had was them painting the majority of men under this flag and then saying some are changing. Most men are not predators.
joy|It's awesome. Sorry, I am a red-blooded male. I see a beautiful woman with a thick 10/10 body and I like it. üòé
joy|Confirmed, word added to Oxford dictionary in 2022. Now to spread the word and get it into general circulation so that this can happen. [NAME].
anger|I find both [NAME] and [NAME] annoying each in different style.
joy|That's awesome!! Look forward to watching this kids progress in year 2
fear|I would have tactically thrown dynamite and blown my self up about 2 seconds in.
joy|The fact you can remember the games he blew shows how great he was and how few and far between they were.
joy|All is well! Think I got one sorted out with one of her family members. Thanks for your help!
joy|Honestly [NAME] is the best character on the show and the main reason it's worth watching, especially the later seasons.
joy|XD lol yes. Ragnarok
neutral|And somehow everyone in the sub is a saint who would never do this
joy|Royals can be prosecuted. Princess [NAME] was charged under the dangerous dogs act many years back the monarch enjoys sovereign immunity.
fear|I'm scared to do these cuz the S.A.G.E. told me I was a transvestite
neutral|Marginal propensity to consume is what I have heard. Any consumption tax is going to hurt poor more than rich, it is basic economic 101.
joy|I‚Äôm easy going, I take everything with a smile. People around me often comments how I‚Äôm always in a good mood.
joy|Ah yes that makes sense - the gofundme for her and the workers seems to be taking off at least (if it‚Äôs legit)
joy|It‚Äôs all about the tech my friend. The person who knows how to control the modem has the power.
neutral|I feel attacked /s
joy|[NAME] I LOVE YOU
neutral|The numbers in my head were (-90,-120). Upon closer inspection, yours are closer. Those two are added together for Total Points Added, no?
neutral|weird. i went 3/3 earlier.
joy|I pray to [NAME] that we will be aware of people's sins in the afterlife when we watch them burn.
sadness|Cognitive Dissonance. Big problem in our society.

surprise|I‚Äôve read this exact same story except the car was a red Porsche.
neutral|No, if the cat's going to escalate then he needs to as well. It's bath time.
joy|Yes, its completely normal. Everyone I know is better than everyone else.
joy|It's very convenient!
joy|Honestly- live your life as a person who can love what others hate- because that‚Äôs just a little more joy in your life versus their hate.
surprise|Wooah :o Didn't know [NAME] had a son xD
neutral|> hands down i see what you did there
joy|That's Great to Hear.
joy|pretty ironic this was recorded
neutral|There is no Mrs [NAME]. Unless you count his sister.
surprise|Reminds of kissing my first girlfriend. [NAME], we had no idea what we were doing.
joy|Thanks for posting OP, much love to the [NAME] out there.
neutral|Was antisemitic rhetoric a problem in Nazi Germany? You're saying this question is the same as cheese tasting purple?
sadness|This feeling is so bad
joy|[NAME] was very athletic
joy|thanks! That helps
neutral|> especially now that Sweden stopped their program What program did we stop? I'm lost here.
neutral|r/punpatrol STOP RIGHT THERE! YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
joy|Don't worry dude. The ladies could never see it if you remain to be a virgin and keep your pants up.
neutral|Yeah but at least those ones are less smelly.
neutral|My crazy idea ... join the PAC-12 in a combined bid with Boise State football. You all would dominate.
joy|Having read the entire article, and some of the other FAQ, the only thing this is telling is that [NAME] read the same book very differently.
neutral|Google owns youtube.
joy|Don't worry, you'll find love, I promise! I hope you love yourself as well. <3
anger|Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!
surprise|...oh goddamn it, that's in my sales territory.

anger|Upvoted twice because this is EXACTLY what they think it is and it sucks rat balls.
neutral|I assumed that came from him brandishing a firearm at the kids after they egged his car.
joy|I, personally, am excited to have another agent to make the lab numbers look pretty while the patient dies.
joy|Yeah, I started to see that as a better option from reading these comments since I own most of the house anyway. Thanks for your advice.
joy|Truly incredible work ;)
neutral|It‚Äôs grandmas house. His house is a tip
joy|Celes represent well her talent tho
anger|That's not a denial ü§î
joy|And let us not forget the lord's privilege with a new bride. Ahhhh......the good old days.
anger|I hate everything about this.
neutral|Looking forward to seeing [NAME] back on his nest
surprise|Fox News is generally not what I would call credible. Any other links?
neutral|If guys like that are your only option, you may be better off single...
anger|Your driving makes me sick [NAME]
joy|This makes me smile.
joy|That's amazing! Did you have a zoom on the drone, or is the post effect?
joy|It's gorgeous
joy|Your loss. [NAME] is an excellent chef, and all of his restaurants are amazing.
neutral|Let her work for her money like everyone else if she can afford to re decorate and go to Jamaica.
joy|You‚Äôre right
anger|Honestly tho. Please stop posting this. We've been seeing this shit since at least 2003 and I was born in 02 ffs
anger|Uh. Okay. I dont thats likely to happen. Even when people were eating babies it was not die moral reasona
joy|Thank you! We‚Äôre currently shoveling ourselves out of the driveway, hopefully well be going there soon
neutral|Serious strawberry and matcha frapps.
joy|The molcajete is my favorite type of Mexican food. I'm not with you on this one.
joy|I figured just being there is the main help. I will probably ask them as many questions as they ask me.
anger|I never believe draft rumors of who teams are looking at or wanting, especially if its fan rumors.
joy|Thank you. This is something I really needed to hear. Hugs, mama.
joy|Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt mind. Glad he‚Äôs still in the NHL. Poor [NAME] was playing in the KHL last I heard.
surprise|when has one of those systems succeeded?
neutral|[NAME] was a horrible [NAME] and HC
neutral|She's a freedom hating commie is what she is. Of course the media loves her; she wants to dismantle everything that made America good.
sadness|Oh. Much less exciting than the edit. We live inside the fungus.
joy|The minute I heard about this this morning, I just knew [NAME] would use it for his benefit someway, somehow... lol. :/
joy|Thank you. This is well-written and it‚Äôs really helpful.
anger|SHE DESERVES TO BE TRULY HAPPY. LEAVE HER [NAME].
surprise|I don't know what that means, nor do I care.
anger|Considered going for the 1st time this year, then I see all the ads targeting kids specifically. Feels weird as a 26 year old seeing all this..
joy|So glad my mom didn‚Äôt act this way when I was diagnosed.... oh, and my mom was smart and vaccinated me
neutral|Probably because he is in a spiderman suit and is planning on doing something funny.
neutral|Sniffing all them electrical outlets is hard work! This is the PC version... Why didn't you use Print-Screen?
neutral|That‚Äôs not populism, that‚Äôs demagoguery. Subtle, but big difference.
neutral|I didn't mean to imply you did! I just know that's a mistake I've seen a lot of people make, is all
neutral|Fair enough, but in most countries, still illegal. Also highly unethical. Then again none of you give a damn about ethics.
neutral|He had 2 years with full control and couldn‚Äôt get it passed...just remind them of that.
neutral|Almost forgot to check if it‚Äôs dead. Edit : NOPE!
sadness|oops, my bad.
joy|Good tips. Will take into consideration everything you said. Thanks a lot !
sadness|And then attacking you as a person when you say you'd prefer not to be stalked and murdered. Sorry but your friend is a problem.
joy|The original DayZ mod music was pretty intense.
joy|Ill take condoms and council tax over dying in horrible pain from typhoid but each to there own.
neutral|This sounds serious. I don't think I have the ability to help ya but you definitely need to talk to someone.
sadness|Now, remember, this is a very dulled version of what were used to considering they‚Äôre still riding the super bowl high from last year.
surprise|Wasn't north and south Dakota one state at some point? Are they putting aside they're difference and getting back together?
joy|their just mad because i love olicity and i think it's the best ship in the whole arrowverse. oh and because i think laurel is trash.
joy|I do! I buy 5-blade Dorcos. I'll never go back to razors marketed to women.
joy|This might actually be one of the few cases where parallel poly will make sense, then ^^
neutral|You get a creepy dog biscuit
joy|[NAME] steals the game! (and the puck for bouncing off of Detroit players)
neutral|Probably past 11 est at this point

anger|I think peach is hotter but not her attitude ha

anger|That isn't in the rule.
joy|Hopefully we will se [NAME] at least as a sub. We love you [NAME].

joy|This is hilarious
joy|Not all. [NAME] is cool. If he ever runs again in the primaries he will get my vote.
joy|That was an horrendous season to an otherwise amazing show
sadness|Looks like the walk of shame. Heading home after a night of partying and to much drinking.
joy|Very sure they are metal.
joy|Crossposting is a terrific feature on Reddit. I'm happy if someone does it to me because it means more people will read one of my posts.
neutral|Probably but we kind of need a lefty though to pair with caleb. Maybe [NAME] steps up again but you know we need more options.
joy|A buddy of mine took his exes ring and taped it to the top of a firework mortar then set it off. It was glorious
disgust|I didn‚Äôt think it was possible for one Twitter account to be so obnoxious, but here it is.
neutral|is solid proof

sadness|I'm nauseous
joy|"[NAME] was the ""socialist"" freshman House Rep. I liked the most, but her recent [NAME] tweets are extremely concerning."
joy|YES BOYS.
joy|Yeah truly ugly people never post their pics on rateme subs.
anger|What makes BDS anti-Semitic, as opposed to just anti-Israel? I see the two frequently conflated, which I think is a mistake.
anger|Oh geez man... You posted this image to at least 600 subreddits.. Why And now made a new account for it...
joy|awesome!!!! I believe in you!!!!!
neutral|12 year old self wouldn‚Äôt understand how I put a pint of ice cream back in the fridge. It should be finished.

joy|Probably overdose in a hotel after losing my virginity to an escort on my 30th birthday
neutral|Your dog is either very smart or really stupid. Either he realized Switch = less doggo time or he just likes to bite into random stuff.
anger|Yeah but they actully had/have shit to be mad about. Their board is incapable.
joy|Maybe, just this time, it's for the better.
fear|Demonize - to portray as wicked and threatening. It's not hard to demonize someone when they regularly demonize themselves.
joy|Honestly- my period stopping is one of my favorite ‚Äúold lady‚Äù things! Ha!
anger|Nice try. That doesn‚Äôt work though.
neutral|Is it because of the huge black spider above it?!? That bugs me more than it being off center...
sadness|This team is so untalented.

joy|Thank you for understanding <3
anger|Can't even do that anymore :(
joy|I scrolled past this and thought this was a title reveal and got so excited. Good GOOD theory though!
anger|Sorry, an errant surge of frustration

joy|I care. How are you today?
neutral|I see,if you'll just excuse me............ ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞ )
joy|[NAME] deserves to play for a proper club ffs.

neutral|Only got to watch the third, why did tage get moved off the top line so quickly? Did they even skate together?
neutral|His Wonderlic score is 25 points higher than [NAME] but 17 lower than [NAME]. I guess he is so/so.
sadness|Yes, and then look hurt when you glare at them for causing a scene and/or not being just as tickled as they are.
neutral|well you see [NAME] skinned [NAME] alive during their feud and is now wearing her skin like a suit and that is why [NAME] suddenly looks good
joy|LOL where did you hear that?!

anger|I hate people using the [NAME] to look ‚Äúdeep‚Äù on instagram posts like that. It gets on my nerves so much
surprise|Is there anything more conclusive, recent, and far reaching than a survey in 1988 Arizona?

neutral|I feel like this is gatekeeping the gatekeepers .... No more elites = no more gatekeepers
joy|because [NAME] awesome.

neutral|those kids hitting the recitation wobble got me dying low key
sadness|It just seems extremely insensitive to say that. That‚Äôs the real problem. It invalidates the other person‚Äôs suffering.
joy|I hate the marvel stuff. I do love stuff like murder mountain and you. So that‚Äôs a hit for me in the last month.
neutral|But thats a few hours ahead!
neutral|[NAME] better apologize to [NAME] for her comments, given that now she knows how it feels to send someone home.
neutral|We have not been a Constitutional Republic for a long long time. The Constitution is just a nice idea at this point.

surprise|only took em all of the time to realize
joy|Oh that's hard. I hope you get an amazing nap in the car. The exhaustion is real with babies.
anger|I have [NAME] hat so I could marry it, flip it and kill it

neutral|That's like if she went up to your car and removed your bumper stickers because she doesn't want them in her pictures.
joy|[NAME] has turned into one of the NBA's great actors
joy|That is genius.
anger|To be fair, we‚Äôre still missing CP3 and [NAME]. This game has been pretty ugly overall though.
neutral|Whats up with the human race turning into invertebrates anyways?
anger|Your not winning their hearts, your just torturing them and they end up hating you.

sadness|Likewise, Reddit has just gotten strange recently, sorry for misinterpreting.
neutral|I mean people at YouTube with the ability to remove the kids channel This post was basically a poor quality rant about incompetence on the end of YouTube not the community
joy|The Japanese and the British can do it well, but they probably get like 10x the funding per capita.

anger|I remember a countdown for when the [NAME] twins turned 18 too. Thought it was pretty gross.
neutral|"I've met very few ""bad"" people in my life. Most people I arrest are ok people who made unfortunate mistakes."

joy|Ok, I guess I gotta show some commitment, thanks!
neutral|I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs enough to make a canon implementation of Cyvasse but it looks like there are some fan-made ones.
neutral|I used to delude myself mine had dreamy eyes. Now I know it was the weed...
surprise|She got more votes tho... If popular vote determined the winner, you wouldn't say this. You sound like you just hate [NAME] for... reasons?
neutral|>I cant really see many objecting. Won't get through parliament, precisely because no deal might well win.

anger|It‚Äôs crazy how invisible, worthless internet points control us
joy|I mean, those are all true for people that aren't pregnant too aside from the swelling.

neutral|Post this to /r/MurderedByWords I legit wanna see the teeth mashing
neutral|> social media addiction is real Except, for her, it's not addiction, just a means to scam the morons who believe her lies.
joy|You look so happy now üòç Hope you are doing well and that you get everything good you deserve. ‚ù§Ô∏è
neutral|This feels like a reference to [NAME] from Homestar Runner but I'm not completely sure.

joy|[NAME] as if he wouldn't just cut the bullet in half
sadness|It‚Äôs sad that some parents can‚Äôt accept some simple mistakes.
anger|I'm just concerned about [NAME] health. Do you think an old, ugly, fat, stupid person like him should be eating such unhealthy meals?
joy|I am so excited to vote for him! [NAME]
joy|That sounds simple and good
fear|I'm scared that they would turn out like me, even if I tried really hard to make them nice.
sadness|Those women's marches are honestly embarrasing. Most of the people there only seem to claim to be a feminist because it's trendy.

joy|You would LOVE this big mutt. He's a doll.
surprise|> I'm genuinely curious Sure.

fear|Don't do that i think its dangerous
joy|You don't suck, jazz is amazing man. Thanks for a album to listen.

neutral|"Yeah the only ""compromise"" is get married ASAP so you can have sex again (which is a HORRIBLE idea)."
neutral|Hey and there are people who drink their urine too. Maybe try that next.
anger|I am annoyed by autoplay they added on hover - and commercials would make me drop the subscription instantly.

neutral|"Looks like they will be the only ones voting for this amendment (""O""). "

joy|A man of fine taste!
anger|>Not all 70% of the filthy [NAME] money is gonna be taken. ...unfortunately.
joy|I know they're probobly not good but I love charged hadoken into vskill combos/mixups. It makes her fireball more interesting than just a zoning tool.
joy|For some reason I'm imagining a hauty, French snorting laugh.
anger|For the love of [NAME] stop making him relevant. Please.
surprise|Yeah that‚Äôs a bit odd, wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see that change come gametime unless [NAME] is shook or something.
anger|[NAME] yer fucked.
neutral|I think the best way to communicate that you‚Äôre not sure is not saying anything about it
joy|Are those both not true statements? Everyone loves attractive people, even employers.

surprise|Ahh dammit I knew that was why I was getting the feels
neutral|Nvm, I see that the drama sub sees what's up
surprise|Have you tried finding other communities to join? Now I know ex-[RELIGION] communities are not that common but just non-religious communities should be rather commen right?
neutral|As you hint at, I think it's more jealousy than prudishness.
neutral|Yes. Views are a real thing that matters. The very fact that a person makes an effort to appeal to voters is not.
joy|Laughed. Out. Loud
anger|My point is that they give him shit for legitimate reasons.
neutral|See there you go. Using the excuse to excuse the excuse.
joy|"Love how she was able to find a 'rabbi' from N anti-Semitic group to ""prove"" her defense of anti-Semitism. Just fantastic. /s"

joy|Omw. When my man sends me that I get all warm and excited cuz I know I get to spends the next couple hours or days with him
joy|I just don't like OP for not explaining it before using the abbreviation. So even though the TIFU was great I downvoted it.
surprise|How you ask? Simple answer, by voting.....or not hence the importance of voting
joy|[NAME] is a madman and I love it.
disgust|The worst thing about this is, there is a good joke hiding deep down somewhere. Someone just used a jackhammer to retrieve it

joy|The papers listed at might be of help.
joy|Thank you so much!
anger|Ugh gross. Don't suggest a PUA book to a kid.

sadness|I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you. I‚Äôm glad you got out of it.
neutral|Your mom did you a favor; now there is one less of ‚Äúus kids‚Äù that will be buying mom a house and taking care of her.
anger|Also technically wrong, it would be last year but not a year ago.
neutral|Why not though? Not enough buyers?
joy|I will definitely keep this is mind and thank you for the great comment!
joy|Yes. It feels sharp and hurts in the chest sometimes. It will pass, but it freaking sucks. I'm here to listen, if you want‚ù§
joy|Because it has rough areas. Which near enough every city/town in the central belt has.
joy|Apparently government cares about the environment about as much as many of our neighbors.

neutral|And then he calls the fans crybabies for saying his movie sucked. Just take the L dude.

joy|good cause i don‚Äôt want it!! haha.
joy|Thanks for the feedback. Sorry, and welcome.
surprise|Interesting, but I can't imagine it will be there long until someone steals or destroys it.
anger|I love how nobody posting here to decry the buzzfeed article is using their actual accounts, they‚Äôre all throwaways. Cowards. Just like your felonious President.

neutral|Ya ikr. I‚Äôm tired and idk how to take what‚Äôs goin on.
anger|They should be liable for this abuse. It‚Äôs just insane!
neutral|So much for [NAME] being [NAME] shadow
anger|You can't talk morality to psychopaths.

neutral|TIL I‚Äôm the only 34 year old that listens to rap music and everyone else listens to bands I‚Äôve never heard of

neutral|They‚Äôre grossed out that these two are blatantly grinding outside of a bar/club environment.
neutral|Probably just unfairly cherry picking things like his words, actions or writings as if those were at all indicative of his beliefs.
neutral|They also have 1 (one) facility that provides 64 percent of their capacity. Mitigate risk much?

neutral|The President who signed it? FDR.
neutral|I'd imagine it's heavily dependent on exactly where in the world you are.

neutral|Well that's Kraaifontein .... Where the kids bite the dogs
joy|Had she gone into the left shoulder before braking she may have had a chance.
joy|> busy blasting stuff with plasma Sound like more fun.

surprise|R u a dad or did ur dad leave u both have bad jokes

sadness|What a sad end for this franchise. I doubt Fallout 5 will redeem it at this point... what a damn shame
surprise|I guess the trick is not to eliminate susceptibility to 51% but to minimize it extremely.
neutral|Stop thinking about yourself. Go help someone and work hard at being useful. There's no satisfaction or fulfillment in self-obsession. Get over yourself.
joy|So glad you are safe. It looks like icy conditions, too, so that is great that you were able to avoid this.
joy|It's legal now in quite a few states. People get booze for Christmas all the time. I'd be stoked.

joy|What you are describing is what I am feeling right now aswell. It's hard to handle the fact but atleast you aren't alone.
neutral|[NAME] was quite anti-Semitic.
joy|Thanks! Here's hoping silly comic book shows don't trigger you in 2019!
neutral|I want to know what goes through someone's mind when they do this.
neutral|Know whats too far? Anchovies
joy|You sound fun at parties
joy|On my way! Thanks!
joy|Ehh, still pretty ambitious lobs for [NAME] though. I'd get it if it was [NAME].
surprise|I don't know, but there's probably a word for it in German.
joy|Just get on good ol reddit and have the nice people decide what you do.
neutral|Now there‚Äôs a thought...
anger|Kinda both. The show itself is mediocre and has pretty generic jokes in my opinion. But the fans make me dislike it even more.
neutral|i thought the comment i replied too was still talking about the OP's vid. [NAME] should have been my clue. my bad.
sadness|That took me a moment. I am ashamed and will now go commit Sudoku.
neutral|I know the one. I bought my dad one as a joke for father's day. He keeps pens in it.
joy|I wanted [NAME] so bad, but at least we got a cute character (little ticked about the scythe but, I'll still play her)
joy|Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk
anger|Yup, already blocked his number, he was never supportive
anger|But also: fuck the daily mail
neutral|North Central exactly... Poor dude's name is [NAME]. Popped right back up and finished the game...
neutral|All the time here! Say have kid an ex wife and there poof gone!
joy|There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept.
surprise|what happened to that uk transfer they picked up, haven't heard much about him
neutral|Dude just get them drunk.
joy|Not exactly the cream of the meme crop there. And on a personal note I don't think ironically bad memes are funny.
joy|Always worth a try. Good luck!
anger|The least offensive example of anyone I've seen telling me to go fuck myself.
joy|[NAME] I hope that isn‚Äôt the release date. I‚Äôm holding out for 12am EST ü§û
neutral|***DEATH IS A PREFERABLE ALTERNATIVE TO COMMUNISM***
neutral|its treason then
neutral|I was waiting for this comment
anger|No they haven‚Äôt and that‚Äôs probably a lot of the problem
neutral|With [NAME] at over 30m (on average), our 2nd expensive player is only at 14.7m? Wow...
neutral|"Baby's face: ""I've been bamboozled!"
neutral|HAVE YOU SEEN MY SON?!
joy|I cackled at [NAME] face down in the corner.
joy|Says who? Comedians can joke about anything as long as it's funny to their audience.
joy|Lmao that's a funny coincidence
sadness|Oh no my jimmies are so rustled! Please desist your relentless banter!
joy|One week sounds like a good timeframe. Good luck on your channel! I hope that expected revenue goes up for you.
neutral|What a vile, vile country we live in.
neutral|This comment is exactly what [NAME] also said about redditors blowing tweets waaaaayy out of proportion.
neutral|LeT mE kNoW wHeN a CoAsTaL tAiPaN sHoWs Up Poor country bumpkins, gotta gatekeep *something*.
neutral|To be fair, [NAME] told her he had a gf. Also, barn girl tried to kill him. Very different situation.
joy|right. cause it's real. that's why she has to talk about it.
sadness|This sounds familiar. But no it will be [NAME] fault. She MADE [NAME] hurt you for the greater good. /s
joy|Try posting to r/mentalhealth I'm sorry this is happening to you and I hope you get better.
neutral|[NAME] and [NAME].
sadness|I miss candlestick :(
surprise|Yeah. You wanna call me a liar, explain why, liar.
joy|Yes I'm sure lol every god has flaws that's what keeps them balanced
surprise|Okay. The wall that he's mentioning. What wall would that be? ***on the border?? Oh my! Big surprise***
anger|Argument a month. I should be so lucky.
joy|Additional space race
joy|No way. [NAME] was annoying. Arizona left a huge gap in the cast, she was great
anger|It's irrelevant though. it doesn't need to be specified in the title of a post.
joy|He‚Äôs still right. Doortrash sucks
joy|Bee happy! ' v')
joy|I loved coming across this today! Nice work!!
anger|I see a 14 day old reddit account angry at liberals.
neutral|>48 thoulsand minutes listened just on spotify Those are rookie numbers! Gotta pump those up
joy|In the least condescending way possible I think you have some gross misconceptions and I'd like to clear them up.
surprise|Wow. Yes. But here I am. On my phone. Responding.
joy|[NAME] is honestly really badass and he has a great design I hope they give him something good to do in 11
sadness|Sorry man, it‚Äôs gonna be really hard to find a Rose jersey anywhere that isn‚Äôt a 3XL
neutral|To distinguish it from regular, every day, healthy, non-harmful, non-toxic masculinity of course.
joy|What I figured but needed some clarification. Thanks!
joy|Uh well one has a long face but I think we‚Äôre thinking of different people here haha. They‚Äôre a popular 80‚Äôs band
joy|I had to look those up.lol. That's awesome. Do you make money by doing so or just pure hobby?
joy|I hope. Sirens got me excited
joy|Argentina is with you! Be strong comrades!
surprise|People hate him? Why? Most call him the most dominant player in CFB this year.
neutral|Kill me.
surprise|The comments made by [NAME] to Truth on Smackdown about [NAME] makes me really think [NAME] has an outside chance at the win
neutral|[NAME] pays big. He bought out Hot Doug‚Äôs so he could enjoy their foie gras sausages 4x a day.
anger|Holy shit I‚Äôm stupid
anger|^ This. You know the guy's a liability when multiple teams openly admit to taking advantage of his defensive inconsistency at the left.
neutral|The NPR interview was linked in the article. She used the term skin texture. I knew what she meant.
surprise|I didn't know [NAME] was in a j rock band
neutral|But asking kids he teaches about him and then telling us that. Weird flex
joy|Thank you to share your opinion and I‚Äôll appreciate this (=
joy|Have fun getting arrested for child porn then! Check your DM‚Äôs üòâ
surprise|Alarming! ü•Äü•Äü•Ä üöìüç©üöìüç©üöì
joy|"""Best prank ever"" :) One of my favorite moments."
fear|One wrong kick can end oh so horribly
joy|It's always been Marfeles. Was 30 years ago when I first visited.
joy|I‚Äôm sorry you are feeling so down friend, that is really difficult. I hope find a way to feel better.. maybe go to emergency care...
neutral|He went to UW, what do you expect?!
neutral|Brother, what is color?
joy|I think he can be much, much better than [NAME]. No doubt. His length, good defense. We are talking about [NAME], right?
joy|Hahaha and those pathetic elderly taking computer classes. What worthless trash people XD
neutral|I'm not ready for that so I won't believe it
joy|That‚Äôs awesome! Hopefully the sanity keeps up
joy|depends on who im with lol. I became an Entp for a short while then went back to being an introvert.
joy|Loved his wife.
joy|Last night [NAME].
joy|I think it may be interesting if the public could vote for films.
sadness|This‚Äôs didn‚Äôt hold up too well.
joy|Oh perfect- I am surrounded by [RELIGION] and they LOVE those kinds of ‚Äúparties‚Äù
joy|Good luck using north melbourne when they change it to 'west' and make a new north melbourne station
joy|I fucking love this GIF so much.
surprise|Happy to hear that :). Where are you from btw?
joy|I'd love it if we actually rotated instead of running players into the ground.
surprise|In this day and age I‚Äôm actually surprised at how many hotels haven‚Äôt sorted plugs by the beds yet
joy|Thanks for the hot take, /u/cumosaurusgaysex
neutral|Sounds like she wanted it done regardless of doctor
neutral|It was [NAME] who said that in an interview too
neutral|Who would win: The Green Arrow or 1 Electric Boi
anger|I'm only saying it because I'm jealous :(
joy|Oh wow this is big. Thanks for the heads up. Indeed! So many great memories that I still like to reflect back on. Thanks!
neutral|There is no 'H' in [NAME]. Source: \|
neutral|Communism advocates a stateless society. They just got kicked in the head into believing Private Property is bad.
sadness|I'm still so sad we never got to see [NAME] witnessing his miracle baby's first steps. ‚òπÔ∏è
neutral|"No, you are just suggesting someone be at the ""perfect"" level of looking for a relationship. Suggesting someone be the perfect anything is just sillyness. "
joy|Happy cake day to you too!
joy|okay for real, i saw this when the game ended. i died. i fucking died laughing. -sent from my HeavenPhone (TM)
joy|Thank you for the context. Everything makes sense now, I'd forgotten how... Certain kinds of people can be
neutral|RemindMe! 1 Day
anger|There is nothing that back ups his claims. To me his views sounds more like wishful thinking.
neutral|Maybe even pay less with the UCP!
neutral|They were clearly ready for it. [NAME] is in [NAME] head.
anger|At least he let you use an envoy. Those are seriously reliable. What color was the envoy
neutral|And what I really want is to have time only for myself, without wasting it at work
neutral|[NAME] with the truth that reality show does not = relevance.
sadness|That's perfectly fine. I'm sorry if I offended you in any way. Have a nice day.
joy|[NAME] isn‚Äôt interested in ceremony but is interested in having time with you. Love this!
neutral|Imagine one day you found a comment that was rated exactly as it should be.
neutral|Technically, if [NAME] are right about him, then you already did nail him... soooooo...
neutral|Let's say for a moment that this was true. How does that get us the truth more often, and more reliably, than science?
joy|Absolutely. It takes me back to a much happier time. When I die I hope I go to San Junipero.
sadness|you never wanna hear that but sadly people will say they love you when what they really mean is you are convenient.
joy|[NAME], I love science.
surprise|Wow, essential oils can now replace oxygen
neutral|but [NAME] is
joy|Oh hi [NAME]
sadness|Honestly wish I could do this, I miss my long hair sometimes :(
neutral|Then stop electing those officials.
joy|If I get another dog imma name it after a [NAME] song SO FUCKING CUUUUTE
surprise|I'm confused why you reposted this from this sub. I'm even more confused why you left evidence that shows this.
joy|Thanks. People on the sub are unreasonable. They think [NAME] is worth so much yet won't give up much for [NAME]
anger|It won't be. Just a rumor.
joy|This is the day we've been waiting for! WWOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
neutral|second this <3
surprise|Wow you found the answer, wish you were on top, will link to you in my post
joy|Wow, that would have been messy.
surprise|This is how mafia works
sadness|These leaks are actually very credible. It's sad that you guys let Hate and anger blind you from enjoying the experience.
surprise|I'm surprised everyone seems to think there will be a season 2.
joy|Sorry to hear that, mate. Please get some professional help.
joy|Thanks a lot!
neutral|At least her granddaughter will grow up to know her worth. *Oh wait.*
neutral|I came. So smooth. So brutal.
surprise|what's your MBTI type?, just curious btw
anger|I will have nothing to do with this specter, who selectively appears to individuals and abandons others. No better than a cruel warlord.
anger|that sucks, good luck next time!
neutral|My knees shattered and my collarbone broke just reading this
joy|Not a good time to make life altering plans like moving in with him right now. Good luck, though. [NAME]
joy|Must've misunderstood something about his injury. Thanks for pointing it out
neutral|Not a woosh but ok
joy|Wow.....
neutral|Used to be the same with [NAME]
neutral|Meaning of life is to work 8h + a day and then convert your lifetime in coins you can spend on useless shit.
joy|Thank you. Posted this to Facebook!
surprise|Maybe or my reptilian DNA hasn't manifested yet
joy|Best side quest ever!
neutral|This is why nobody takes feminism seriously!
joy|Yes Thank you ! Someone might try to sue me because they pulled out and got pregnant ... use full body condoms if you think Facebook should support your baybeeees
neutral|At least you went out! For what it's worth, I definitely would have gone out with you if you were near me.
neutral|Fluid to the top!
joy|Lol nice. I can't say the same yet. What do you do for a living if I may ask?
joy|I was grouping twitter with it. Tweets were great this year
joy|good to hear my man!
surprise|Can I see it?
anger|Your appearance doesn't magically look objectively creepy just because you're a creep. You're being stupid.
neutral|I don't think I've ever seen that flag flying in this city, we mostly just have the provincial flag and the Canada flag
anger|*snerk* People like this kill me. Idiots.
sadness|Wow. Racists are really coming out of the woodwork to excuse and defend racism. How sad.
anger|Glad we aren't all like you , the world would have sucked
neutral|You didn‚Äôt offer any proof. She gave the dnc some money to stay afloat. You have yet to explain how that translates to them damaging [NAME] campaign
joy|You just need to live your best life. Do the things that make you happy and don't dwell on any of the negatives.
joy|thanks mate! yes, will buy some protein shakes today.. fucking expensive but better than starving i guess
sadness|I think you also underestimate how big Chelsea has become, especially in the States
joy|Hope + Sabres = Mistake Just remember that you love hockey and do your best to enjoy the ride.
surprise|So how did all the new airmen with you in that class feel like after being treated to the real Air Force?
anger|??? Where the hell is this article getting it's data from...
sadness|You know he meant Golden Gardens. You are not discussing this in good faith.
anger|Oh, fuck off. It‚Äôs no one‚Äôs fault but yours that you think every mention of the word ‚Äòmen‚Äô means you specifically.
joy|It‚Äôs fitting. All things Considered.
neutral|That's me too! I even try to avoid trailers since they reveal too much these days.
sadness|I lost it when all the heroes kept going back and forth into siege range
joy|nice, was a big fan of REQ but haven't kept up with their progress much the last year
joy|Let's do this... 4 game win streak again!
anger|They didn't actually run any tests to confirm it was even bone, let alone human.
joy|I hope these young women change the church and not the other way around.
joy|I ate 2 lots of rice a day, with chilli. I also had a bowl of high carb cereal. I lost 4stone. CICO, is real!
anger|they're shite - disgruntled OCSC fan
joy|My own worst enemy singalong is my favorite LOL
joy|Hi, [NAME]! I am dropping by to wish you the most fantastic day of your life! Have a good one! -HappyFriendlyBot
neutral|[NAME] Just sell the team your true love is the Chicago white suxs
joy|Actually pretty :(( as [NAME] since the Hair is one big abomination and it could have been sooooo cool.
neutral|This is a powerful mood.
surprise|I always wondered where it was on ormond. I managed to find the toolbox last week on yamaoka as killer.
fear|That was a fluid motion and it scared me
anger|In the worst of the anger phase I took up running. It‚Äôs hard to stay in that state while your legs are burning that much.
neutral|You can cancel his single orb shot with melee too. Great for close range as discord headshot+melee is a shitload of damage.
anger|[NAME] path made me hate everything associated with pirates
joy|Hey congrats!! That's amazing, you've done such amazing progress! Hope you have a great day :)
neutral|Oh.. yeah dried
joy|Thank you for your input! I‚Äôll look into it
joy|Yes. (That's the back side of the Palace hotel.)
joy|Wishing you all of the best friend !!!!
joy|I know! It amazes me every day, but I'm SO, SO thankful for those lists.
surprise|Oh [NAME], oh no, no no no
anger|[NAME] enslaved the [NAME] and MLMs enslave...well...everybody.
joy|Damn girl, Stockholm syndrome is strong with you. All I can say is I wish you all the best.
anger|Because I have no self-control and I hate myself.
joy|Wish i had more up votes for you.
surprise|So, they want a more profitable split? Surprised they wouldn't go for the Discord store then. Didn't it offer even better a split?
joy|Those cards are so cool
joy|Cute pupper üòçüòçüòç
fear|Yeah that‚Äôs one of the things I‚Äôm most worried about, still hopeful!
neutral|They do it because easily entertained people appears to be .... entertained by this. So they won't stop until people stop clicking on this trash
neutral|Should have drafted [NAME] and then never traded for THJ...Anyways, just happy we got [NAME] out of this finally.
joy|You used the correct term. Good job.
joy|He raped you. Leave. Now. Cut all contact. Easy answers here. You deserve far far better than this
neutral|Shoot, darn. You win again!
joy|I look cuter in red P‚Äôs.
surprise|Read in the news yesterday that 3.6 million have lost their insurance since the rump took office. I wonder how many of them died because of it?
joy|He's ridiculous, I've never watched out west when he was on the Spurs. But damn. Hope He stay.
disgust|Disgusting making [NAME] talk to this fat moron
neutral|Nah man, there's still no worse feeling in the game than getting frozen by [NAME].
anger|Goose don‚Äôt give a fuck
anger|Man I thought [NAME] was going to be the real deal. I wanted [NAME] gone so bad around that time.
joy|lol @ additionally ‚Äúlearning‚Äù physiotherapy as if we DPTs/PTs didnt spend our own 3 years learning.
anger|[NAME] why would you blow your load on your fucking suit with fur on it
neutral|Plus ultra!
joy|Be ready to Experience Canes Hockey
joy|It‚Äôs good dude I had to have it explained to me I‚Äôm just passing on the love
joy|Well I did have one balanced meal...before a few alcoholic beverages.
anger|My barber was thinning my Hair with a new blade and cut my ear. Bled like crazy.
joy|I love Subnautica. It's so, so terrifying but also beautiful and cool and I can wimp out and put it down any time.
surprise|So is the OP still permabanned for no reason?
anger|They are probably waiting for his harasser to pull a [NAME]. Filthy men.
joy|And in the case of human trafficking, these people we should be given homes and protection instead of being tossed out to be abused in their home country
joy|Thank you. As a father I found this hysterical. I'm legit laugh-crying rn
neutral|The men who didn't get other matches were being hypergamous in matching with a [NAME].
joy|Oh I see...I keep trying to do the move everytime they're down. Thanks for the clarification.
joy|Maybe Streamlight Strion if OP wants something Fenix PD35 sized? Havent used one myself but have heard good things.
surprise|LOL THEY DIED? like if you get reference
joy|Like [NAME] said at the very end of the stream, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still here and you can still do amazing things.‚Äù
neutral|Likely some more bitching about easily fixable features being swept under the rug by employees
joy|In case anyone is wondering.. the money was a 20$ tip. Edit: 200$. I‚Äôve been corrected.
neutral|Meta. If you feel otherwise, please speak now, or forever hold your bow.
sadness|sorry this happened to you. id be sad and angry too if i worked hard on something, and someone took that away
anger|No one does... that what makes it so provocative.
sadness|My only regret will be posting this on my alt account.
anger|1:30-4:30 it‚Äôs completely dead. You sometimes get late lunch orders at 1 or early dinners but that‚Äôs it.
joy|Clamato? I see you Canada. And I like it. By the way, we need Wonderbars here in the US. Thanks
neutral|At least she didn't hot glue it
neutral|Yes please! OwO
neutral|Good luck to [NAME] if he really thinks he can take over the country with the most armed citizens. Trump derangement syndrome is real.
anger|Facial hair ability: [NAME] Looks like [NAME] got a bloody nose a week ago and hasn‚Äôt washed the blood out yet.
neutral|No since parries read the heavy press, not the release.
joy|Excellent summary.
neutral|You‚Äôd want it in higher resolution I reckon
neutral|Aye me, it's shite and the folk who follow it all think there cool, bore off
joy|SC6 has a colourful cast and is actually very easy to get into. So yeah man, go for it.
neutral|i think you misunderstood my comment. [NAME] over [NAME] any day
neutral|oh i just subscribed for the entire snap thing. i forgot to unsub and that post showed up in my feed, so i looked through the comments
joy|So what is then, the race of western peoples? You're treading in very problematic territory friend
neutral|This feels more like r/fellowkids to me. This is nothing compared to some of the more dystopian stuff the government has pushed out to be fair.
neutral|Megatron hanging out with [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]. This is like a fever dream
neutral|No, but we have beer and whiskey
anger|Yep. ~~(Also, I'm not interested in getting arrested so sorry.)~~
neutral|I don‚Äôt think you can be compelled to testify against someone else over a traffic violation, I would just feign ignorance
neutral|You‚Äôre probably recalling it correctly! It was maybe 2 years ago? Very ugly & sorted story
neutral|who knows, maybe people are cold and a dumpster fire is exactly what they're looking for to warm their bones
joy|It's easy to overthink things online, I'm glad you gave him a chance.
joy|Ah yes thank u, now the image is very funny
neutral|Due time to me is a couple of years. Have plenty of time though
surprise|Are there any Veracruz fans in the sub?
neutral|Go to McCalisters and get their sweet tea, THEN decide.
neutral|That‚Äôs what the shake is for, though.
joy|I like your babyüòç
joy|Dude was okay?! Oh thank god, i figured at best paralyzed from the waist down
joy|Cool story bro.
neutral|"To be fair, ""Junior"" was released 25 years ago."
neutral|And also something against [NAME]. (My definition of [NAME] is just people at the bottom of love distribution)
joy|Here‚Äôs to taking care of ourselves and reaching out to each other and getting the support we need!
neutral|"""My body is not me, but it is only one of the most popular songs ever."
joy|Nirvana is a great band but a good chunk of people in their fan base are just awful (underratedly awful)
joy|"It's not ""over"". Don't believe that. Focus on making friends. The more people in your network, it seems better."
joy|‚ù§Ô∏è you are a strong individual and there is an amazing amount of support behind you
joy|Wow great analogy, exactly like that yes
neutral|The huge pics of [NAME] and [NAME] wedding looming over this dysfunction own
joy|Thank you for that statement.
joy|Also put icecream under the taco for a nice sundae suprise üëç
surprise|I considered that they might be doing that, actually...but I googled it and it didn‚Äôt seem to be true.
surprise|I like how he wrote many of the TRUE [NAME]. I wonder what a fake [NAME] believes in.
neutral|I live alone. Well, my dog... I do have to shut the door to keep him out. He gets too personal with his nose.
neutral|Bear your teeth at them and snarl like a dog
neutral|You‚Äôre thinking too technically about it. All politicians should be threatened with life in prison or execution if they go back on the word.
fear|is this sub scared to talk about [NAME] getting arrested
neutral|More please!
joy|As much fun as I've had yanking their chains, does anyone know the background behind these particular scam calls? I've gotten several of them lately.
joy|love this! makes me want to go hiking at superstition this weekend.
joy|Mad respect to her for being honest. I like how they consulted a dietician for their article to confirm a diet of cocaine and tapas was unhealthy lololololol.
joy|[NAME] looking good for a big game
joy|You are welcome, I have faced lot of sibling related issues. Hope things work out well for you.
surprise|I read TFTFD periodically, too - - I wasn't sure if the Mods there would leave the post up or tell LAOP to post on r/AskHotel instead.
joy|She‚Äôs just not that into you, that‚Äôs what I think. You need to find an HL girlfriend and go have fun.
neutral|You say 'A single MP' as if it's not that big of a deal. In my humble opinion, that's still probably one too many...
neutral|Accidentally dropped my cologne... stings the eyes
anger|Both parents were drunk. Where were the small children? You helped her cheat and possibly contribute to child neglect. Awesome.
neutral|He needed the trophy in GTA?
joy|Here in the UK I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve never seen a taco
joy|aw thank you, I want to get rid of some of my extra things and eat food with less packaging
anger|üòÇ Poor kitty.üíó I can hear that howl and see that face! You betrayed her! üòõ
anger|I‚Äôm from Ocean County and I don‚Äôt enjoy admitting you‚Äôre right.
joy|King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard and Beach House are my two favourite bands.
surprise|Is it weird that I‚Äôm relieved?
neutral|But her cancer the second time was caused by the chemo! /s
surprise|Why not ask a friend to do that?
joy|[NAME] is definitely a good player, would probably be an [NAME] in the East, but fuck him lol
joy|I'll message you when I have the time to play! :) Ty!
joy|more like consistent*winner*, i hope you find a lasting happiness
neutral|I kinda like that AC1 is still untouched. At least for now.
surprise|Have the zombies symbols available somewhere near for the Ra step, it's the most challenging
joy|Thank you destruct
neutral|Yikes hope hes ok
surprise|Can genes be altered? I feel like I‚Äôve heard something like this.
joy|I know right?! My parents are extremely proud & grateful they don't have to help me pay debt.
joy|And ALL of you will tune in next week because it‚Äôs the best trash TV ever created!
joy|A work on yourself to change these issues. Or live a life without close connections. At the end of the day its depends on which you want.
neutral|Except the rest of the scoreboard is in blue (score and time) or white (team names). I did figure it out but certainly not straightforward
joy|I need more videos of this cat, love its face xD
anger|I'm on episode 8 and this is where the show has gotten boring af for me.
surprise|"""in2"" Is this a time saver over ""into""? This reporter says no."
neutral|Fun fact, His pants are on backwards in this pic
neutral|There were more but they got deleted for being duplicates. I removed a couple and the original posters removed a couple too.
joy|Go watch the video where she does [NAME] makeup, [NAME] is super tall, especially compared to [NAME].
joy|Geez, we still got about an hour left lol
neutral|[NAME] and clutch free throws are arch Nemesis
surprise|The president's own charity is under federal investigation so its time to drag out some so called progressives and show that there are bad people on all sides.
joy|Lol. Well, I enjoyed our heart to heart either way
neutral|I was so sure that was [NAME]
joy|It would be funny and sad if he gets heart complications again
neutral|[NAME] plays with [NAME] for 2 minutes and he's already doing outlet passes lmao
neutral|Furthermore, that top part isn't even males only. The bottom part is tho.
joy|Funny. The only people who have ever attacked me were conservative [NAME].
surprise|I would be so pissed if I was part of that coaching staff. That was unbelievable.
sadness|Oh gosh, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. It sounds like you handled it really well. Kids are cruel.
neutral|I just saw a post above this about people getting offended by jokes too easily
joy|This makes me smile
neutral|I bet you're part of the gangs sneaking illegal, murderous drugs to other countries just to keep your family better fed than someone elses family. Fucking psychos
anger|so abused...
joy|HAHAHAHA!!!!!
anger|And even then... It won't be for long.
joy|Close game but glad to see we came back in the end
joy|You can love both [NAME] and the person you are with.
joy|It's a great town.
joy|The US and Canada are great allies, it's really a shame they've elected their worst.

sadness|I didn‚Äôt even realize it says it right there. Sorry
joy|I like it
neutral|YOU KNOW THAT SET WAS W E T
neutral|You want to celebrate your convict heritage.
joy|The 1st 5 minutes of this game will be key. Hope they come out with some passion. Go Oil
anger|That sentence should be illegal.
neutral|[NAME] was speaking as a man./s
neutral|Except my points are objective facts and his are opinions.
surprise|Not to be harsh but I feel like she has been dieting and working out for quite some time .. wouldn‚Äôt there be some change by now ?
neutral|This is getting old.
joy|I forgot the Olympics was gonna happen there üòÇ hopefully the signs and stuff will stay!
joy|given his form over the last year or so, turning into nueur would have gotten us that goal haha

neutral|IDK about this stuff but I think you need a psychologist.
joy|Obviously. Every post here is intended to be a joke. Just not funny ones, like this post.
joy|Thanks for your addition! I didn‚Äôt know any mercy players who made good content for her so I left her out. Appreciate it!

joy|Nah, I‚Äôm good, just trying to help you out. Have a good one
joy|It's got home made bread pudding so therefore the rest has to be good!

joy|omg he could soft feint headbutt into GB thank god i wasnt around when that was possible
joy|I loved shooting if we were gay and 6969. The peanut butter took a while, but was worth it
joy|He's so handsome
neutral|I think you can find it in pieces on YouTube. But CW seed should work. It‚Äôs odd that it isn‚Äôt.
joy|Yeah pretty much. People do change, but never ever do they change because someone else demands it from them.

joy|In fact I plan to start using them in my videos since I plan to make this year feel like 2009.
joy|I always thought the name of that sub, like this one, was intentionally ironic.
joy|Exactly! When the mom went to kekeing in [NAME] face to FaceTime with [NAME] in all of 10 minutes my jaw fell to the floor!

neutral|Omgsh. What‚Äôs bad is if you look at her two years ago she looks normal and just beautiful and then it progressively gets scary
joy|[NAME] will be gone. Although I think end of the first is where he should go, he will go super early
anger|Fuck ya boys let‚Äôs go
joy|Yeah I agree, it really is interesting. I guess that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so many different medications out there lol.
neutral|I'm not sure you know what a [NAME] is

anger|It‚Äôs oddly unsatisfying when someone beats me to saying that.

joy|This. You need medical attention and they'll be able to put you in touch with resources.
surprise|But this isnt about a comic book movie. It's a cartoon. Also this is a right wing website...so how does this not count?

joy|Thank you for being open to self reflection and for sharing this.
joy|[NAME] learned to fight smarter, not harder. I love her development so much
joy|This guy sports entertains.
joy|bet he loves to slow dance
sadness|That's the best part, I can't even imagine to live forever with my shitty body
joy|Hold on to your butts!
joy|This is so powerful.
neutral|> Do you accept evolution? Depends on the denomination.
neutral|Nah i‚Äôd say that it‚Äôs reasonable enough to be in mildlyinteresting.
joy|I think it is worth documenting this sort of stuff, as a reminder. They'd do this to your kids too. In a heartbeat.
joy|[NAME] FINALLY fournier, [NAME]
sadness|It‚Äôs time to stop lad, it‚Äôs getting a little embarrassing now...

fear|Shock collars are horrible. They poor pup. üò´
surprise|Except the federal workers won‚Äôt be facing an income reduction, only a delayed payment. I wonder if that restricts them from accessing the program.

neutral|"Well, you *are* ""Doing something else"""
neutral|also big pp
joy|My dad had the same problem in the same fingers thanks Op .I'll share this with my dad.

joy|Well keep planting more!!!
neutral|I see you missed the announcement. [NAME] tweeted a teaser.
neutral|I don‚Äôt feel like anyone‚Äôs blaming him

joy|I'm supposed to be going to see [NAME] at the cinema tonight. Truely resenting this decision, want to watch [NAME] so bad
neutral|He looks like something the [NAME] brothers would create.
neutral|imagine being engaged to someone and then finding out he has been hiding that he is a MLP fan

neutral|You missed so many...
fear|Nowadays I get nervous watching Steelers defense. Back then, I couldn't wait to see what they'd do next.

neutral|This is golden.
neutral|What makes this not the place and time?
neutral|My god she is desperate for a do-over baby. What a shrew.
sadness|Plymouth: Confederate flags Diesel pick up trucks Dead factories Heart disease and disappointment
joy|"Innovation means ""I pridefully made this"" in China."
joy|Last nights euro run had over a foot for most of the area lol. Its probably overdone but still crazy
joy|Love that lane. It's like the best part of Rome.
joy|He was such a pet!! Beautiful looking dog
sadness|Sitting here, waiting for the price to drop so i can buy more. I guess it's not gonna happen.
joy|Couldn‚Äôt agree more with you. Thanks for this post!
joy|I agree but if we fell behind we lost the game without any chance. But let us be grateful that we have a Toplaner that is really godlike xd

neutral|An other skier that wasn't injured I guess
joy|lol, suit yourself.
neutral|Why not make a piece and send it to them?
joy|I don't have a problem with this if their hands are clean.
neutral|Half the topics on this board are various factions insistent that the other factions are ruining this game.
neutral|By that logic the NDP need to stop existing to prevent the Liberals from going to the left.
joy|Thank you so much, kind stranger. I really need that
neutral|I feel more attracted to boys. It's not a conscious choice.
anger|If he wants to play more, he should play better. Otherwise, leave. [NAME] has been very bad.

joy|If you‚Äôre downloading from windows I believe so
joy|You've been muted. Usually awarded for extreme toxicity, don't worry though its temporary.
anger|I am just saying that it makes no sense in Russian
neutral|Just like he couldn‚Äôt call his executive producer [NAME] to ask if [NAME] had met [NAME] in TFA.
neutral|Yeah, think there's only about 100k of them. Can certainly say I don't know of any besides [NAME].
joy|Well I was balding at 22 so I didn't have choice lol
neutral|Admin is all over it!
anger|It would certainly improve some services (like transit) but would piss off enough people of both cities that I can't imagine anyone proposing it.

joy|If reincarnation is real, I hope next time I have a name that's half as awesome as [NAME].
joy|[NAME] has been really good this game and I thought he was good against the coyotes as well.

joy|Thats awful and Im sorry for your friend. I whole heartedly agree. Its getting out of hand.
anger|Yah he is right, just find it hypocritical.

neutral|Forget it [NAME], it's Chirotown.
joy|Calm down [NAME].
neutral|this is why the right thinks we can‚Äôt meme

neutral|Was [NAME] ranking revealed today? had him in the 90‚Äôs IIRC.
surprise|**WAIT THAT WAS A REAL STORY!?!?!? WHAT THE FUCK**

surprise|Oh I (and he) did not realize that. I‚Äôll correct him the next time I see him.

joy|Not gonna bother reading that you're not gonna change my mind lol
neutral|Nah some people naturally have rapid ass metabolisms like that. I sit around all day, but I‚Äôm skinny as a rail.

joy|Lol I even got called transphobic. Love to not be allowed to dislike Mother.
anger|This joke hasn't really worked since the 11th Century. Even then it wasn't that funny.

neutral|Someone needs to quit horsing around I‚Äôll go home now
surprise|Are they sure one didn't kill the other and themselves?
joy|"I think you need to explore your motivations a bit more. I very much doubt you just want to know and ""That's all."""
joy|I laughed.

joy|Congratulations, there are success stories in this group. Forge on with your life but watch out for other (jerkfaces).
joy|I completely agree, and I love Space Jame. But Back in Action was just amazing and incredibly satirical and witty.
neutral|This is more normal for INTPs, but ENTPs can be this way as well.

surprise|US postal service right? Might have something to do with the government shutdown, but I‚Äôm not sure.
neutral|[NAME] has to be spinning in his grave right now

anger|Talk about a fucking hot take. Quality shit posting from [NAME] (not you [NAME]).
anger|That‚Äôs not a good thing to do. And taking it into account for sentencing is fine. But she‚Äôs still guilty.
surprise|My biggest question is: who is [NAME]? Also: who are the [NAME]? Also: who is [NAME]?
neutral|Not really, I like staying at home. When I go out for food I'm in and out of the store as quickly as possible.
neutral|No, cause the number of games and mins he's played to get those points is a joke.
neutral|It‚Äôs like frank trying to eat that celery
neutral|I do know not one neighbor looked out to check on us because they told me....

surprise|This definitely seems like medical advice is needed?
surprise|love em or hate em I think we can all agree that was blatant PI
joy|That's actually a really good one. Atleti fans also seem to love him and literally everyone who faces him despises him.
neutral|[NAME] was a [NAME]. He's on your people.
neutral|when you j/o before hooking up with a girl so you last longer
fear|Idk how to use any.... the 5th one looks scary

sadness|I BELIEVE! I am sad that likely no one else will see it besides me...
neutral|She's going to OD without a clue the first time she's introduced to Avocado & toast...

joy|Hijacking <---- THIS IS A GOOD THING.....chicks llike guys with balls, and chicks with balls.
joy|Kinda like a thing that comes out of the ground and it smells nice, I think. Cannot confirm
anger|The worst thing they risk is having to become a worker.
joy|I agree. Your last sentence is definitely a better way to word it
neutral|Don't let her find out we do that here then. She'll want one.
joy|I wish I could be you. Our thing is dragging on forever and I‚Äôm heartbroken af.
anger|Thank you, I didn't know about this sub but I'm subscribing immediately

surprise|I remember hearing a story about this type of highway camaraderie once from a trucker who helped a woman escape a man... wonder if it was your mom
neutral|I would think they probably couldn‚Äôt take it if you tried
neutral|Absolutely not. What if a girl did this to you? Instant turn off. She doesn't seem interested. Keep the communication face-to-face at this point.
neutral|because [NAME] is already signed in on their device and you dont remember their password and really want to see what happens next season
joy|Thanks for the laugh
joy|Previously it wasn't working, now its fine though
joy|Yeah I had a lot of respect for him in that moment.

anger|Obligatory fuck the dodgers
joy|I feel that way about [NAME] antis saying [NAME] and [NAME] antis saying [NAME]. But I‚Äôm also terrible and laugh every time I see it.
anger|You people really overestimate how much welfare actually covers. You act like one child is making six figures and giving their entire family an MTV Cribs lifestyle.
neutral|That's just biased nonsense. There are good and bad constituency MPs in all parties.
neutral|It would seem difficult to say you're living in one city when you're only applying there to expand your reach.
anger|Stop. How can you watch [NAME] these past years and think he has 2-3 years left.
joy|I read that as [NAME]. Lol
joy|It's nice, but there isn't much there :p
neutral|No audio here either (Reddit mobile app)

neutral|Guns are too quick. You can't savor all the... Little emotions
joy|Hope you feel better and you‚Äôre on the way a speedy recovery.
joy|Wait, what? Lol. Weak call. I'll take it.
neutral|Why would you say that... Oh my [NAME] those tags!
sadness|Yup this game just gets worse and worse
joy|Oh, the boat was already on its way out lol
anger|Or just shoot them. Shooting annoying people is why guns exist.
anger|Shrug, ndp is still going to lose. I don‚Äôt really care how many there are.
surprise|Isn't that what most of the old people forced to rot in assisted living facilities want?
sadness|I am bored of [NAME]. Next celebrity chef!
sadness|Wasn't expecting these feels man. I'm so sorry for your loss!
anger|Shits me no end mate, good on you for doing something

anger|No, I'm anti racism.
joy|1. Well said. 2. I like your style. 3. Prove it.
joy|Brush your teeth and neither of these smells will be reduced by chewing a napkin. But it's funny to convince a friend at a bar that it'll work
joy|Interesting indeed üòï
joy|you are my inspiration, read my last post quickly!
fear|I‚Äôve never cringed so hard
joy|that's the point
neutral|Doing the bus story would be interesting-- perhaps interviewing some drivers who have encountered a ghost.
sadness|I love Chinese buffets. All the ones in my town are gone, all buffets are gone, sucks
neutral|Did they give you a warning first?
anger|Still an ad hominem and not a legitimate argument or counterpoint :)
joy|Beautiful picture!
neutral|[NAME] is a New York populist. You might as well have voted for a [NAME].
neutral|Yeah she is. Do you think [NAME] faced the same problems [NAME] had? like you said major problems in the prosecution
joy|I was almost certain it was gonna be [NAME]
neutral|Sounds like not a typical 1/3 hand ...
surprise|That sounds really agonising, to ask for help and have no one hear you. What's going on for you right now?
anger|The world is backwards, nowadays. Where people defend _GaNgStAs_ because it's culturally and politically correct, and then shame those who protect and serve. Makes me bleed rage.
joy|He takes so much abuse...and i appreciate it's him and not butcher or severson tight now.
anger|Cant talk about the a***a
neutral|Noted, I've been looking into that
neutral|I've never been so bored with so much money on the line. I am numb now.

neutral|Yes!! I have noticed this so many times. Like it will just pop up after I learn it.

anger|Fuck the rangers
joy|Yea, I saw him live in Stockholm. It was awesome!
neutral|It was 90 degrees
neutral|Other than the [NAME] storyline and the flashbacks the stories building up to the main villain went in circles. Wasn‚Äôt anything exciting or to interesting.
anger|You smug fuck
joy|Oh you'd prefer if I used this pic instead? I understand.
anger|LONDON I honestly don't even understand this one
joy|Yeah [NAME] has won worlds
joy|Send your story over to r/nice guys, they'll love it
joy|I love these blobs, would have done the same thing
joy|This may be the first thing I've seen on here that actually made me laugh instead of just an amused nasal exhalation.
joy|I like your style B)
neutral|PROBABLY BECAUSE HE THINKS YOU‚ÄôRE ANNOYING AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO END A RELATIONSHIP THAN A HILARIOUS FACEBOOK POST

joy|Best comment ever.
anger|that was such a misstep from their PR. wtf were they thinking people were expecting with a public countdown
joy|I'm so glad Mercy's have to actually try now.
neutral|Go buy groceries and don't spend another dime for an entire week. Please....

joy|No spelling and grammar errors. Oh my [NAME] better than the other repost.
neutral|Dude, if this was real you wouldn't have mentioned godfather.
joy|Because it‚Äôs possible. My partners mother had it and she passed very young as a result.
sadness|I got that feeling as well. Hoping he retires a Jet. We are the one org that embraced him. He was coaching sam every step.
joy|Agreed. Personally I don‚Äôt understand meeting up for just sex, but I still don‚Äôt judge those who do it.
sadness|Oh man... my grandparents on both sides of the family have passed away and it was tough... we‚Äôre here for you

neutral|Mr. [NAME], I don't feel so good...
anger|"Oh, I stand corrected -half a million people is ""almost no one"". Bloody hell mate. "

joy|Yeah, when I saw she was in LA, I really hope that. Oh please, be true.
neutral|We aren't even buying it's loans and still nobody has been signed

joy|Best pen in baseball, even though I'd still take [NAME] over [NAME].
sadness|If you‚Äôre talking about ÁéõÈõÖ, I checked and they‚Äôre permanently closed. It‚Äôs a shame since the location would have been perfect.

joy|The latter is a good description of the last 16yrs of my marriage (now over, thank the gods).

neutral|I am whelmed
anger|"He didn't ""die"". The dude behind pink guy doesn't want to continue being pink guy"
joy|[NAME] would benefit if he could help end the broken two party system.

joy|Hahahaha!! I was thinking the exact same thing. But you could really feel the excitement while reading! 10/10
fear|This is truly terrifying.
anger|Nope. I‚Äôm not wrong. Flipper superficially inflate housing prices without substantively contributing to their value.
neutral|Putting the opposite outcome of what [NAME] says is a close second imo
neutral|Maybe trust biology and basic science instead of some dumbass who is just writing about gender cuz its 2018 and people are morons
neutral|You know, I'm gonna say the n word.
joy|may I direct your attention to the aforementioned ‚Äútin foil conspiracy‚Äù
anger|nah, my face is the farthest thing possible from cute ;-;
neutral|He has a kid that he pays child support and my 2 younger siblings that he also calls leeches

anger|I‚Äôm so jealous
sadness|You've been a sad boi around here for the last week straight, you'd do well to take a break.

neutral|What's awful about it?
sadness|True. You always gotta be careful. It's pretty sad actually. I feel used and abused.
neutral|stone hard heart??????

joy|This. Thank you.
joy|I guess I've never seen that written out. Thanks for the correction.
neutral|That‚Äôs all I noticed.
surprise|2weeks ago?
joy|Yes, you're supposed to keep it. Like I said, its only when the voice gets out of control that you should start to worry.

joy|Nice mix of trashy and classy.
joy|"If that's a euphemism for ""emotional thinking"" then I agree with you"
joy|At least we aren‚Äôt getting blown out. And Vegas is hot right now

anger|SUBSCRIBE TO PEWDIEPIE OR I WILL HACK YOUR REDDIT ACCOUNT!!!!!!

joy|I know and I think that's a lot more impressive/interesting. :)
joy|*Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** slumbishop! ^(hug)

anger|Ooof girl...I thought this was satire at first it was so cringe.
fear|They come to your house and rob you at gun point. Be honest. What are some ways that this could be resolved?

joy|It most definitely is! You‚Äôve gotta pick some up!!

neutral|You don't need financial management when the government handles all your money and all your legal representation is also provided by all mighty government.
neutral|I should‚Äôve used that when my dog died.
neutral|Right on. I‚Äôll change my comment
neutral|Someone has sex with that.
joy|Oh, okay. Thank you. I hadn't been keeping up with it.
joy|of course you agree. you post in r_braincels.
neutral|This guy has some serious emotional issues...best to ignore him and not engage
neutral|Why? What happens?
neutral|I thought she was married to my boyfriend. He's got some splaining to do...
sadness|He looked so sad when he was talking about how it feels to be getting criticised üò¢.
anger|You're the one making a positive claim, give studies or shut up.
sadness|I was also bullied at work. I was on lithium for a while. You're not alone.
anger|I hate beer. But I'll concede the point because others like it. ;)
joy|Have an interview in 11 hours and it's after 2 AM bet LETS GOOOOO
neutral|I read the books right after season one, and so I had the reverse problem. I didn't see the show as the same series anymore.
anger|Violating the law has never been a prerequisite for being charged with violating the law.
joy|No at that point you‚Äôre a POS, or just have horrible taste in women lol
joy|Would be a good idea what deal labour wants.
neutral|I'm not very good at pressing the devils doorbell, but apparently I'm decent at licking it.
joy|I watch more Netflix on my phone than my other devices. And it looks incredibly amazing on my Samsung phone screen instead of my mediocre PC monitor.
neutral|Cheat - no. Disrespect her current relationship partner - heavily to the point of her ass deserving to be thrown out.
joy|Megagrindr, and I love it.
neutral|That thing is rather thin , it wouldn't be a big problem to tap-swallow it
neutral|It means she likes it when you do that thing.
sadness|I'm all for finding ways of reducing gun violence but this seems to just be arbitrary and capricious.
neutral|Oh you mean 490 ‚Ç¨ from your fellow citizens who work so they can pay taxes that fall into your pocket?
surprise|What about [NAME]? [NAME] I hate her.
neutral|Unsub from both
joy|lol, Cause everyone knows that you lean on the Bow. What bow skin is that?
joy|Here‚Äôs a little update lol so far I‚Äôve had 3 matches today and all of them were ‚Äúcam models‚Äù lmfao
joy|Cheers brother. That‚Äôs very interesting. First time I‚Äôve seen that article.
joy|Sure, doesn't change it being overwrought nonsense though.
surprise|O-officer what are you doing with those cuffs? <w<
anger|I didn't like this, not for even one second.
neutral|If you buy a membership for yourself and your friends you can easily buy tickets to most games.
joy|Omg sorry I just laughed out loud and also died inside for you.
surprise|What are these words? I'm so confused.
anger|What's even worse: the deciding voter refused to support the subway because he was strangely obsessed with a horse & buggy transit plan from 1858.
joy|[NAME] I hope we get lucky again. Great job with the write up. I don‚Äôt follow college ball too much so this helps a ton.

joy|Lol. Mod conspiracy theories. Yes they want to destroy the sub. That is their goal.
joy|Nice win! Good luck on your future tournaments!
neutral|This 100%. [NAME] was a great enforcer, but him scoring a hat trick with the Thrashers was just crazy.
sadness|it's quite a large red flag. It depends on the context, but if they are in her dating league, I would be suspicious.
neutral|[NAME] has not played under [NAME] for a single day of his career.
joy|Hey everybody we got us an optimist here.
surprise|So you have your twin 6'9 215 pound forwards playing different positions? Interesting gm'ing. I see why the Hornets are so terrible.
joy|Opposites attract! I thought the same thing when he helped her cook Thanksgiving.
joy|I loved [NAME] so much
neutral|tRuLy A wOrK oF wOnDeR
surprise|Why wouldn‚Äôt the cops turn off the truck and take the keys?
surprise|Missed the beginning of the game, cheers or boos for [NAME]? I'm assuming cheers, but you never know in MTL

anger|This doesn't even make sense!
joy|Okay just thought it would be a good idea.
anger|No you shouldn‚Äôt. If you recieve income, it should be taxed.
surprise|Time to cut him off. Or find a way to get him good help. Cause he sounds a little dangerous.
anger|Sir the fuck down. This is an intervention, we need to talk.
sadness|a lost art
sadness|I actually find running harder than passing on all madden
joy|So smart it looks like he shut his fingers in the door. That‚Äôs a nasty bruise under his fingernail.
anger|"It's ironic that those who most strongly embrace TSSC and other churches are so often utterly lacking in any level of true ""faith."""
joy|Fascinating! Thanks for the info!
anger|I hate his hoist a shit shot and throw your legs forward so you can draw a foul on the defender for crowding your landing space.
sadness|I used to have no problems finding them, but I‚Äôm struggling really hard now
joy|I love how this sub is so sensitive. Some people just havent seen them IRL!
joy|hello im bipolar 2 the fun kind
joy|He must simply be known as [NAME], all the greats are known by a single name.
sadness|Pls end me
anger|I‚Äôm not a detective, but I don‚Äôt think it was her.
joy|Being ugly and confident does not mean you'll do well in dating. You'll just try more.
neutral|Well you‚Äôre not wrong.
surprise|a realization of the fact that you're not good enough and you have to work a lot harder and develop your taste?
surprise|Wouldn't you just enjoy more focus on Celtic football?
joy|Good for you! So awesome!
neutral|I cannot answer this question without asking you to read a specific book.
neutral|The mouthbreathers usually aren't boys but guys between 2-3 times my age. Possibly homeless and very smelly.

surprise|I don‚Äôt know but I think they at least have foil inside, I remember seeing you could hack one into an antenna.
anger|Motherfu... thanks for pointing that out!
joy|"""look at you... look at you..!"" Oh, I'm bawlin. "
neutral|She wants this ‚Äúfamily thing ‚Äú more than she wants her daughter to feel safe.
neutral|Which state? It's actually quite rare.
anger|I‚Äôm gonna go out on a limb and say that‚Äôs a terrible idea.
neutral|Note to self: always remember to draw my eyebrows on before posting a selfie.
sadness|Œî sorry I completely forgot about these, but yeah you definitely changed my view
neutral|It probably won‚Äôt affect it at all other than you might have more energy.
fear|All of their Saints are psychotic idiot who died for nothing. People remember them as horrible people in death as they were in life.
sadness|I can‚Äôt stand [NAME] but that was heartbreaking
joy|Really glad you were there for her. I wish you both the best.
neutral|..mmhmm...ye...yeah. I said it

joy|I'm so glad to hear that! Good luck rebuilding yourself.
neutral|I am friend
surprise|So the key to living is to do nothing?
joy|asking for a source is good lol
joy|You're right. I totally forgot about [NAME].
joy|You, I like you
disgust|It‚Äôs disgusting
neutral|Wtf is that
surprise|What is TMOR?
anger|I regret that I have but one downvote to give.
neutral|I'd guess if they could do a basic blood panel (chem-7?) that would be a billion dollar idea.
anger|[NAME] doesn't seem to have based this on anything. The owner of the nightclub says there was no altercation at
joy|I absolutely love DCfC!
joy|No. EDIT: Shoutout to the fat nerd who downvoted every comment in this thread just because we don‚Äôt stan the dancing games lmao
joy|I like [NAME] as a person I just don‚Äôt want to see or hear any sexy times between her and [NAME].
joy|My man!! You go. That's brilliant. Brightened my day.
anger|Because he's attractive. Hence [NAME] come out in droves to defend him despite the fact he's a horrid asshole.
fear|Its almost as if everyone is too afraid to be politically incorrect to admit that height and race are a factor.
joy|It was a great AMA too
joy|He's the only legitimate jetpacker
anger|You don't get to decide what is discussed in this thread. You are not in charge here.
surprise|Can I get this as a flair
anger|The cult of reason was very unreasonable. :D
joy|25000 likes wow! I got max. 30-35 likes.
joy|It‚Äôs never funny if you explain the joke smh
neutral|If you kill a spider instead of putting it outside, you are a grade A bitchmade babyman.
joy|At least [NAME] got to touch UFC gold. Not many people can say the same. In good company.
anger|It could also be that coupledom is the wrong way to live for OP.
neutral|Even his practice kick on the ice timeout barely squeaked over from just 43 yards
joy|Yup! Was a great shoot, can't wait for the video to debut so people can enjoy all the hard work.
neutral|[NAME] as a coach. That definitely doesn't make me feel old.
surprise|1. Dr. [NAME] job is just cause drama and look frustrated 2. I wanna know the mothers of people ITT
joy|Man pre ASG Yankees were absolutely fun to watch. Judge hitting that homerun was awesome
anger|That‚Äôs what I thought. With 4 out of the 9 still on the show, I just can‚Äôt call it accurate at all.
surprise|I knew a guy named [NAME]. Always wondered what his middle name was.
joy|use this to make you aim better than my bad aim :)
sadness|Well ya but it's kinda too late for that unfortunately
joy|Ain't that the truth. It has turned into one old big propaganda/commercial machine.
joy|Hahahah that‚Äôs actually really funny no judgment here, do you friend
anger|if it's harassment its a criminal charge. I haven't read the decision yet but this seems like a stretch based on what i know.
neutral|That‚Äôs not the whole
joy|[NAME] is just awesome. I have vacancies for long range adoptive grannies if she's not busy?
joy|Funny how [NAME] only lies when you want him too,amazing.
disgust|"Dentist did this to me I hate it. I knew i should have waited until ""it wad worse"" but i didn't. I regret it "
neutral|Man, I'm 13 and still took my time because the entire volume enclosed. And the heart is from rick and morty copy pasta.
joy|That'd be fun! Meet at a bar and watch the show!
neutral|My [NAME]. If only
joy|[NAME] is a monster, my favorite of the Pythons. Such a perfect smug face.
disgust|Yeah this whole thread is gross. Calling a little kid trashy or misogynistic or sexualized for liking to play dress up is just creepy and weird.
joy|That's all I'm asking for :( thank you for expressing that it is a possibility, and for making me realize it should have happened...
neutral|here
neutral|He specifically called t a ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù rather than a plan. Commitment means they told tulo he is the shortstop.
neutral|Ask them if they‚Äôre going to give you a ‚Äútest salary‚Äù for it... if not, nope out of there.
joy|I saw the video and liked it, but I should say: Man, you almost make me dizzy by moving your head that much. üòÄüòÄ
surprise|Maybe that‚Äôs what boogie was trying to say!
neutral|Not really sure we could get salary's to match up
neutral|I went into business with two friends and none of us speak anymore. Eventually money changes everyone for better or for worse.
joy|I wish I'd get invited to parties...
joy|Why thank you sir!
neutral|where are my upvotes
sadness|Man being unattractive in appearance has pretty much taken any joy out of my life
anger|Just horrible. Doesnt solve any of his problem and removes his strongest tool.
neutral|That what my friend says who still wears garments.
neutral|what no pls
neutral|Mine is entirely too interested in any and all candle-related mitzvot. She basks in the Shabbat candlelight and was absolutely spellbound by her first Hannukah.
neutral|Not just bad, but actively shortens your life because you have finite energy
surprise|is it a jailable offence
fear|"[NAME] i love this ""no one can be THIS happy, what a horrible person he must be"""

neutral|Latest buzzfeed article.... 10 ways you‚Äôre a moron if you think we‚Äôre credible.
joy|I am still confused a bit lol
joy|For real we swept Tampa last season? EDIT: Wow we did, our playoff run against them was a different story
joy|I'm glad she made it as easy on you as possible.
anger|You are absolutely loving this and it is sickening to watch. Catch your fucking self on you spastic child.
surprise|Sounds exactly the same as GC to me?...
joy|Hell yeah it did!
joy|For a sec I thought I was on NoSleep. I'm glad no one got hurt.
joy|Awesome and interesting response!
surprise|Omg my 3yr old kept rubbing it all over his face the other day too!! üòÜ

sadness|"we have a ""righty"" complaining about ""lefties"" making up BS, while they make up BS... sad."
sadness|"""I've made a huge mistake"" - Me, walking into this person's house."

joy|Now that's ride sharing!
neutral|This is wack
joy|You'd better get to work then! See you in 10 years!
anger|Oh no he didn't!
surprise|"Interesting point about how *guanxi* ""makes corruption an intrinsic characteristic of the Chinese government."""
anger|Because most shit right wingers say is so awful that if they said it in a space where they weren't anonymous they would be fucking done
joy|I'm sure you're alright, [NAME]. xD
joy|Lake inle is a beautiful place
neutral|Me and my best friend both are..
joy|Best day of the week!
joy|A beautiful poem for a beautiful thing. Happy cake day btw!
joy|Are you actually serious? I'm really interested in the details lol
neutral|Not really. They redefine the NAP and ownership until the people they don't like are now the bad guys just for trying to exist.
sadness|The guy that waived a future hall of famer. Hard to get away from that decision.
joy|Great. How about go fuck yourself moron, I‚Äôm making a great suggestion for a good reason despite you bitches.
neutral|Ye is dragging a wagon
joy|I never had a problem with the old parachuting mechanic, but I like the new one and I think it might actually be better.
neutral|[NAME] bless America
joy|I am also a doctor and his legs are in fact discolored. But seriously dude go to the doctor.
anger|Seeing the Reverend talk to his son like that always made me feel uncomfortable but also mad.
neutral|And when I thought this sub was gee AF someone says the day with this gold nugget
joy|Thanks for defending your tribe.
joy|This should be everyone's wish.
anger|I don‚Äôt think so. The rest of her profile was completely serious. She had photos from art museums and discussed politics in her profile.
neutral|I don‚Äôt see why they wouldn‚Äôt, this is very much weighted in the Magic‚Äôs favor.
joy|Ah the ol' cucked boyo. Whatever after what I've seen you won't change my mind buddy, that's for sure.
neutral|That's really not that long ago given his age and this sort of thing is more than controversial.
neutral|All star is a popularity contest voted by the fans. Stupid as fuck. [NAME] should be an all star this year
anger|My husband never watches this show. Watching with me: ‚Äú[NAME] is a horrible dad. He looks likes he hammered. He‚Äôs so greasy‚Äù
joy|I mean the whole discussion is about sales soooo...
neutral|Yeah I should have said ‚Äòwouldn‚Äôt it be ironic‚Äô
neutral|This is so me! ‚ö∞Ô∏è

joy|Hey, thanks! :)
surprise|Was expecting a horrifically broken ankle. You have posted the actually unexpected
joy|Doubt is an integral part of faith. Dont worry, it will help you in the long run
neutral|This meme is dated and lost it's humor years ago. All you're doing is taunting people who have followed a different path in life.
neutral|" future reference: In the sidebar, ""Google doc with more reference links"""
joy|Right now I'm listening to Stand By Me, I'm liking it
sadness|Based on her other post she's young, pregnant and possibly homeless. Looking for help and advice.
joy|I think sweaty is hilarious in the context of r/forwardsfromgrandma which is where I see it 90% of the time
neutral|Like what?
neutral|Baby I‚Äôm Yours--Breakbot
joy|I know it's so amazing. Too bad all the people that hate the game haven't thought of giving it a try.
joy|Happy New Year you wonderful mummy you! I was thinking about you today and hoping you were doing okay ‚ò∫
joy|Congratulations, you did it
joy|Love it.
joy|Beautiful!!
neutral|But at least you know where you stand with a restraining order. At least 1000ft away.
neutral|This is caused by a downed power line discharging to the ground around it.
joy|I see so many different worlds in this! Love it
joy|[NAME] chatting with a kid while waiting to come out for the stars of the game. What a great guy.
sadness|Please, please, please don't do that to yourself. You'll end feeling worse when this guy leaves you.
joy|good luck getting them to understand that
sadness|What's worse is getting in a car that isn't yours
surprise|oh, so he is insane?
surprise|Damn didn‚Äôt know it was for a whole now that‚Äôs crazy
joy|Start an initiative to take away cops guns since you feel so strongly about it
joy|Still better than YouTube rewind
neutral|This is why business and family should never mix.
joy|"I would say something like ""Hey I've seen you around school... You were in(class)"""
joy|Oh yea [NAME] from Danganronpa 1 is great too, a cute hacker girl and one of my fave charas from the franchise! ‚ú®
joy|Ah good, now I don't have to do it.
joy|Hey, better safe than sorry with spoilers. But my point stands.
joy|Look how pretty she is. YES QUEEN YESSSSSSS
joy|Am I the only one that wants to see your art?? I love calligraphy! You might have a client here!!
joy|They should do it even harder now to spite you
surprise|I thought he was #25?
joy|Thank you - will await your PM.
sadness|Yeah, sorry about that. I see it in so many post I thought it was almost a custom to do so.
sadness|You know, I was wrong. I always assumed false dichotomy was their favorite fallacy when it's clearly strawman.
neutral|Exactly[NAME] is refusing to acknowledge that his romantic relationship, as formed, is over and to move on. OP, you're incompatible.
joy|In a few years she will probably be claiming to be in her 30s!
anger|Mother of [NAME]... Im not grossed out very easily. I can stomach just about anything. But this made my fucking skin crawl....
joy|Yeah, I‚Äôm going to do my best to avoid a fight. She‚Äôd probably kill me.

neutral|I mean I understand the joke but are y‚Äôall actually going to he posts relating to the team
joy|As an [NAME], half of [NAME] are unfortunately right
joy|I really wish I could do that. The furniture is all made from my grandfather so I don't want to get rid of it. :(
neutral|*Uh, I‚Äòm [NAME], I like penis in my mouth*
surprise|And then what would The Bulls do if he says he won't be the head coach anymore? Put an assistant in there?
joy|My grandparents were holocaust survivors. Seeing things like this and trying to comprehend the horrors that they had to endure really helps put my problems into perspective.
anger|[NAME], they deserve each other, but I don‚Äôt want this to happen because they would inevitably procreate and make stupid ‚Äúboring‚Äù kids.
sadness|It was probably either a wrong number, a prank call, or a girl you forgot you met and she was embarrassed. If something more happens update us
neutral|You solved the box, we came. Now you must come with us, taste our pleasures.
joy|You're the best !
neutral|Reminds me of this short.
surprise|My best guess is because the wine in his glass is purple. Whether it was a purposeful [NAME] quote or not, I dunno.
joy|I agree. Could go either way.
joy|glad you made the trip from a fellow austinite
joy|"Little kids are the best because they're just like ""Wtf?!?!?"""""
anger|well that's no creepy in the slightest
joy|Oh mate! Happy days. haha. Yeah I totally thought you were starting a course of Radiotherapy haha. All good
anger|Why are you making questionable jokes at work? Unless you work in a comedy club, it really aint the place.
neutral|Ya'll are way too hard on cops. Did you know that 60% of cops don't beat their spouse? That's more than half!
sadness|...and they're gone. Didn't even get to see what they cost.
joy|Piss off a small percentage to gain an even larger one? That's hardly unheard of. The amount of publicity alone for this is astounding.
neutral|your mom is safe when she bangs me she makes me wear a condom so she doesn't get preggers
joy|I hope your life is as lovely as you are
sadness|It‚Äôs so sad that i can play all these Zelda games on my 3DS but not my Switch. I have like 12 Zelda games on my 3DS

surprise|Wouldn't it just be enough to be really interesting is to go through the arguments. However, I would guess this is the most symmetric of these.
joy|I know this is a joke but people on this sub actually think this way lol.
fear|This sounds like borderline mental health issues. Scary.
anger|Way to cherry pick. Remember that time that [NAME] person got lit up for like, 9 goals against or something? Man, that guy sure sucked.

neutral|You're getting downvoted because every one of your comments is condescending af

joy|Yay the same out of touch old people cycling thru the same positions. I can't wait to see the changes they bring/s.
fear|You're right to be nervous. That happened near my college's campus when I was a student. She lost everything in her wallet.
neutral|There is a difference between attacking someone, because they say they don't like someone else and attacking someone, because they kill people.

joy|That actually sounds pretty bloody hilarious. Maybe I'll work that into one of my one-shots.
surprise|Who's we? Because a lot of people on your side don't seem to want that.
sadness|They need more with more items because I've never been able to get same day.
joy|Just subscribed! Keep strong bro focus on the end goal :)
joy|Oh thanks a lot! :) Please let me know.
anger|Ha, my husband goes out after you guys have done your thing and checks for himself, he's been burned too many times.
neutral|That has nothing to do with the sub...
surprise|Ok now I‚Äôm wondering what you‚Äôre on
neutral|I‚Äôm not sure that asking one person about her opinion on tipping in a country that doesn‚Äôt widely employ tipping is solid research.
surprise|Why? You might be right I didn‚Äôt think of that but I‚Äôm curious to what issue that would create
surprise|On my first date with my now wife, who is an MD, she said she was intimidated by me. I think it was the suit though!
anger|Yeah but FGM is basically like cutting off the head of the penis entirely. I'm uncut myself but I get why people do it

sadness|I applaud both of you for taking whatever action you can to make this succeed. Sorry I couldn‚Äôt offer any advice. Good luck.
disgust|This is going to be a disaster
joy|Fear - that's it. You need to work on identifying and overcoming your fears.
anger|I'm not white.
anger|Since when can a family member drive against other familymembers because you both own it? That would go horrible if that argument was valid! What the hell!
sadness|Or you just get rejected and then not murdered and your anxiety worsens until you can no longer approach women or even men.

surprise|You're really just having a field day today huh?
neutral|That would increase [NAME] political power inside Turkey even more. Especially when he is getting weaker because of economic distress and refugee problem

sadness|Easy: he‚Äôs completely unrepresentative of Colorado and really bad at his job.

neutral|For every Undertale or Stardew Valley there's dozens, if not hundreds of other games developers put their heart and soul to, but never catch on.
joy|"I really love how he just flung out ""dead mum"" on the offhand chance your mum was actually dead. High risk, high reward."

surprise|did he just hecking kill [NAME]
neutral|Furries would love this
sadness|She was so excited, oof the comment hurt
surprise|Wow, ouch...

neutral|Imagine finding that in your bed
surprise|other than the fact that she's totally korean you mean?
anger|"!remindme 4 days ""Stupid Entitled Parent, sunglasses"""
neutral|That's not [NAME]. That's [NAME]. His family founded this country.
surprise|Protecting the border is self-defense. It's not really a selfish thing to do.
neutral|Bold of you to assume that I have two other friends
joy|Ah, the movies are fine. It's pretending they're a profoundly trascendental form of art that I find ludicrously funny.
neutral|"""we need to help the homeless not the immigrants"" But also ""if they are homeless they deserve it"" "
anger|Sorry man, it's not gonna happen. The music needs to be remastered for vinyl specifically and that's more than your budget.

sadness|Poor kitty. All you can do is give her extra treats, playtime and cuddles.
neutral|I‚Äôd smile back at you
joy|No the bubble is love. The bubble is life. With the bubble comes zero expectations and a sweet sixteen appearance. Such is life in South Canada.
neutral|Maybe also therapy and medication.
neutral|There's no reason ever to get [NAME] breakfast tacos when you live in Austin.
joy|I saved up for a top hat recently and it turns out not to fit as I have a large skull. Thanks for your kind words.

neutral|No that's called your sister is the milk man's/s
neutral|I actually got her IG from the video above. If it‚Äôs an issue, the video should be removed.
anger|This is probabaly going to be an unpopular opinion but I definitely think all police cars should be clearly marked, unless they're part of an undercover operation.
surprise|Is there any way you and your partner could borrow more money for college and live on/near campus?
neutral|After they put the bullet in it I wouldn't be surprised if it got scaled back even further, considering just how much of the community up and bailed

neutral|I give you points for making me very surprised to see [NAME] up there. I'm glad he is.
joy|It's pretty clear if you understand basic math.
joy|You‚Äôre truly welcome :)
joy|He is good! Funny thing is, a lot of the religious dogmatics in his videos remind me of certain IT posters.
surprise|I will be surprised if this actually has an impact. Just a few statements about the importance of the commitment to defeat ISIS and the withdrawal will continue.
joy|[NAME] was pretty cool on The Challenge so I would love to see him on CBB.
sadness|How sad that you think because [NAME] wants something we should no longer want it. Grow up you child. Life does not revolve around you or [NAME].

joy|What did we do to deserve [NAME]? Loved that guy since his buff days
surprise|I can't believe people voted us to beat Sydney. I've become extremely optimistic over the past few months and even i voted Sydney.
surprise|wow, you guys have a body language now?
neutral|TIL when your fiancee steals 500 from you to buy products that harm you physically by being in the home due to allergic reaction you're controlling her.
joy|the excitement when they all first come in always makes me happy
surprise|Wow - never seen negative karma before I clicked on your name lol.

neutral|They really dislike each other.
neutral|You mean [NAME]?
surprise|Gentile is a perfectly fine term (not as coopted ironically by the white supremacists). Do you disagree?
neutral|ah so youre the guy who shows up to the party with one goal, to yell at people when they don‚Äôt play by his own rules
anger|If the goal of this show is to consistently find people with horribly annoying voices, I have to say the producers are spot on.
anger|Oh, so I can go straight to hell when I die? No thanks.
neutral|PUT THAT MEME BACK WHERE IT CAME FROM OR SO HELP ME!!!!
anger|Damn i guess people shouldn't steal. Or smoke

joy|ok, so there are no checks client side, thanks for the information and all the best luck on the project!

joy|Good luck. :)
neutral|X2 I normally defend him Not tonight
anger|This sub is a fucking joke now
joy|Wow! You must have pretty low standards for teachers in your state/school! I guess that's why Massachusetts is always first for education.
joy|More along the lines of ‚ÄúI could stick that vein with my eyes closed and one hand tied behind my back‚Äù lol
neutral|Right now I live in a medium sized one but I have lived in a big city for a couple of years.
joy|I love how he said he was moving on and then didn't move on. Classic [NAME]!!

joy|Well said man. I hope you‚Äôre doing better now. Love the username btw.
anger|Ego is a hell of a drug

neutral|Now there are two of them!
joy|Yayyy!!! Go little green bean go!!! Good job trainer!!
sadness|I‚Äôm sorry to hear this. Unfortunately online dating is trying to find the bits of gold in a pile of pyrite
neutral|Ignoring facts in favor of your own opinion (which is contradicted by those facts) = [NAME] logic
joy|It isn't complicated at all. You are growing up. Congrats.
neutral|Yea. From my estimation I have about 5 years before I should just pack it up completely.
joy|Probably just do the job and try to work out your anxiety rather than taking the path of least resistance which offers no character growth. Best of luck
anger|Is your PC beefy? It looks like Battlefield god damn
anger|How so? How do you keep stupid people from voting?
sadness|Look at their post history, they're just spouting nonsense to get a rise out of people. Dont be the guy that falls for it, its embarassing

surprise|Exactly. How that woman has survived two no confidence votes amazes me.
neutral|EA‚Äôs cancelled more Star Wars games than they‚Äôve made. They should lose their exclusive right to make Star Wars games
neutral|Virtus.pro straight into Grand Final.
neutral|I second this. Revlon makes a great cuticle oil with Jojoba and a few other oils in it.
sadness|It worries me that there are people that miss the meaning of a subject by so much. Your critical thinking skills sadden me.
neutral|You are tough as nails and think fast on your feet. I feel I would be trapped easily in this scenario

surprise|Is she dead? She looks dead...
joy|he'll be hurt next year too
joy|Congratulations fellow lobster!!
neutral|What did it say?
anger|This article was written so poorly that it's hard to take seriously. It's like a stream of consciousness with very little to actually say
anger|It's ridiculous that [NAME] has inspired way more people to join rather than leave but there are way more media articles by people who have left.
joy|Yeah you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm not fit for the position! Thank you for giving me the right words to say.
joy|Lucky you, our low is only gonna be 3¬∞

surprise|That's some good stuff! What did you think about [NAME]?
surprise|i can't believe i havent seen this before. well i was going to watch nosferatu tonight but change of plan

sadness|sorry. I don't want to put words in your mouth.
joy|I've not- I'll have to put it on my watchlist.
neutral|Someone beat me to this beauty of a term!
neutral|I'd imagine it's a team of people in marketing.
neutral|No, mom doesn‚Äôt like fights and my sisters afraid of getting hit (even though he doesn‚Äôt hit her)
neutral|They don't get this. They think the universe revolves around them so the rest of the world has to do whatever benefits the narc.
joy|So happy to see [NAME] regaining his form... we had to sacrifice [NAME] for it, but i‚Äôm okay with that...
neutral|[NAME] was a pastor who witnessed the ‚ÄúWood Scrape‚Äù and credited the rodsmen of the [NAME] cult as creating [RELIGION] 1.0

surprise|How do we do handle the venom, and marvel is all metaphors-avi [NAME]
anger|No, not sarcastically :)
joy|I like you both.
joy|Suppressing anger is a horrible idea. You want to dissipate it in some healthy way, not bottle it up.
surprise|Do you dislike the concept or the way they use prepositions? Does your first language lack the concept as well? :)
surprise|What makes you think any of it is hoarded? It‚Äôs likely to be near 100% invested.
joy|If you‚Äôre you and comfortable, you go, girl.
neutral|What does your statement even mean? It's a game set in WW2, not the war itself.
joy|Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.
joy|I'm glad you can relate. I'm glad in a really alienated, empty way. But glad, still. Probably.
neutral|"To whoever entered a flamewar with me a few months ago for saying [NAME] was dangerously underweight... Yeah. That ain't ""healthy""."

joy|not to worry, I'm on the case.
joy|[NAME] is both pretty and strong, I think it's a great name!
joy|"Super petty. The story makes you sound pretty jealous and controlling, as well. Especially the ""SJW"" line... It sounds like a 16-year-old incel. "
surprise|Yeah that happens t
joy|Dude, let‚Äôs just offer them a choice between remaining and staying. Democracy, lmao.

neutral|When people ask what the show was like back in the day before it went national‚Äî that is the closest it‚Äôs been
anger|I find it boring and, at times, incredibly annoying in all of the games. It completely lost its appeal somewhere around Black Flag.
surprise|Oh yeah, I forgot about the mean one.
surprise|Not so sure. I have a decent body but until I took the time to focus on my posture I was slouching.
neutral|It's cuz we've played less games than them

joy|mmmmm.... love me some kapusta with some bacon bits
sadness|Not surprising.
joy|Me too üíï
sadness|I'm hopeful but going in with tempered expectations. There have been some remasters in which I was really disappointed. BioShock comes to mind.

anger|[NAME] from ZoE and [NAME] from TTGL. Actually fuck all that [NAME] from The Big O is where it's at.
anger|I hate roundabouts. For some reason road designers have a fetish for them as more and more are popping up. For cyclist they are rings of death
neutral|That works too. To each their own.
neutral|Your r/brogress post doesnt look dyel
joy|And then the oligarchs in charge will be forced to say how they really feel about America... this bizarre logic has very interesting potential.

joy|[NAME] has shot the three well the past few games. great to see
neutral|Sounds like you had a much rougher night than me. You win this round
joy|You should come. You'd enjoy it.
neutral|He has utterly squandered his time since leaving office. For those of us trying to champion his legacy it's a perpetual headache.

neutral|Please don't /u ping users in SRD.
disgust|As someone who went through school before the internet existed, yes, weird creepy kids existed. Although it was more in your face.
anger|I'm with the photo guy. It would be an awful feeling to watch your date flirt with some other dude ON YOUR DATE.
joy|Have faith, I'm sure there is enough fan support for more popular characters to be brought back.
neutral|Any EU countries that get tricked into nationalism become prey and weaker relative to Russia and the US.
neutral|Yupp. If you drive down South Broadway you can see SoBro spraypainted on some buildings.

joy|I‚Äôm sure [NAME] was thinking this when he told his daughter that she stunk like a toilet on his deathbed.
joy|This is cute.
anger|Why slum it if they‚Äôre giving you actual cost?
neutral|I left the profession for exactly that reason. I couldn't emotionally handle the apathy
neutral|Rattles off potential free agent edge defenders, neglects to include [NAME].
surprise|Wow does that really work? I've never heard of anyone doing that before.
neutral|You become assertive and take back your share of the power and control over your life. Go get No More Mr. Nice Guy.
joy|Coinbase LOL people think place is the answer. I think it‚Äôs Cancer.

joy|I like [NAME] but he's got bizarre mechanics on his jumper and no arc.
surprise|Wow what's it like to be so petty? (Fixed)
joy|Proof of [NAME] love for mankind, beer and dogs. Love both and abuse neither.

neutral|[NAME] was seen walking into a doctors office in NYC using Google maps for directions. That screams 2nd opinion if I ever heard one
joy|As a vegan, I can't tell you how happy I am to find any restaurant with vegan options! That man should be showering you with gratitude.
joy|The Donald raiders are the most savage of the bunch, they not only downvote brigade but also annihilate civil debates

neutral|Watch Dortmund sign the better player in [NAME] to replace him...

anger|If being bisexual means I'm in a cult, I'm kind of pissed because I haven't received my cult robes yet.
surprise|New book? Or is he talking about 12 rules

joy|My fav character
joy|That's right, always be extra careful around the corner.
neutral|>We had a bunch in the prequels (which also suck, please stop giving them too much credit salt miners). It's treason then.
fear|Well, since everything in Australia wants to kill you, I'd say it is quite healthy to be afraid of Australian spiders, and other flora and fauna
joy|I‚Äôd want him to keep whatever gimmick this is it looks interesting
neutral|Of course you can. We have the freedom to choose *who* exploits us, but not whether or not we are exploited.
anger|just speculation at this point but it's not looking good

sadness|Yeah that was my bad. I was just heated after that loss and was being an ass. My b

surprise|> Why do you think you're in financial hell? He spends the rest on drugs according to his post history.
neutral|Seriously, old friends talking about massive life developments when they see each other again isn't bad this is silly.

surprise|And how often the Asian guy is the token gay guy (especially since Uncle George came out). What I would give for more Asian romantic leads!

sadness|What's really sad is that [NAME] wants to outlaw gay dads. I'm literally shaking.

anger|wouldnt like most of the pokemon fanbase be adults now tho
joy|Don't forget the part where [NAME] doubts himself or goes off on his own and fails. Then [NAME] tells him how much she loves him and to run
joy|They've been banned. We'd like to start leaving up more comments though so that threads actually make sense. Capitalists will always be banned.
neutral|450 coast to coast at WM!!
anger|How did this get upvoted? This is patently false.
joy|Signing [NAME] and [NAME] is not fucking around? Lol
sadness|yeah. it's like you know something real bad is gonna happen at any time. that's why I never try to get my hopes up too much.
joy|I'm betting you're 100% right. üòäüçª

neutral|I buried the hatchet with them last year. Phuck Philly
neutral|This image is cropped to avoid showing the private passenger car NY plates. [NAME] has no need to pander to any ethnicity; he's term limited out.

joy|Imagine what hed be like if he was actually very rich lol
joy|Besides the fact that's it's funny she also looks like me witch makes it .5% funnier

fear|This sent shivers down my spine
neutral|Wouldn't your definition of a person apply to all mammals?
anger|[NAME] is bae, how dare you.
joy|No, the best thing is to do cool stuff with care. That's what science is. You don't learn if you don't do stuff.

anger|Tribe member? They aren't native so that's annoying. To me, because I am.
neutral|Got her game on.
joy|Thank you. You too.
neutral|But they would fail without it, using your silly logic

joy|It would be faster then light travel
neutral|Why?..... just.. why?
joy|Me too, I've heard before that I'm too blunt and I feel bad about it at times
sadness|Yep. Lots of younger generation are obsessed with their phones and emotionally rocky tend to engage in this behavior, especially women with their whole Instagram obsessions.
surprise|i don';t know about that, it's probably aliens.
anger|"Don't ""neg"" the university (or any university) and don't write about doing illegal, unethical, or immoral activities. "

joy|That is awful. :(
joy|I could honestly just go without intermission interviews altogether.
joy|yeah, it's basically Hillsong with sugary shakes pretending to be food.

joy|Whataburger misses you
joy|"I love his calls even when things get ""pear-shaped"""
anger|yup - he threw [NAME] under the bus with no guilt

joy|Funny they put her between [NAME] and [NAME] as well.
joy|Pretty cool that the same building is there just a different use.
neutral|bite your tongue
neutral|That‚Äôs a lot of emotion for a queen who deserved to go home
sadness|It doesn't justify singling one guy out when the whole team played bad. Even [NAME] had a bad game.
surprise|But if I want the objective control how do I go about it in the early game where respawn are fast?
joy|Ah, yeah. That's the trouble with anywhere that isn't London/NYC, especially if you speak English.

neutral|Athletes in the making. Can't wait to see them playing professionally.
neutral|I‚Äôm ready to be hurt
joy|First- damn what a block Secondly- that was a really smart timeout there. Expected a prayer shot.
joy|LOL that would be way better
joy|LMFAO! Thank you but I was inquiring about the OTHER one.
joy|Hopefully this loss rejuvenated him. Im a conor fan, and even though I like khabib as well I admire some of his older philosophies
surprise|Ok but how is that a jerk he‚Äôs not pushing anyone off their chair
neutral|I assume you have have kids because you believe that since condoms are not 100% effective, you may as well not use them?
neutral|Not to mention that half the women out there are immediately disqualified (at least in my book) by having kids.
neutral|*Day after day, ordinary people become heroes through extraordinary and selfless actions to help their neighbors.* -[NAME]
neutral|Not sure what the point is, apart from illustrating the similarity of ordinary people throughout the world. The interviewee is a fairly normal ignorant bigot.

joy|It‚Äôs beautiful hun
joy|Broad city is my favorite. I need a BFF like them
joy|I love this place. I have multiple things from them, and the employees are super great.
joy|Awesome, thank you! :)

joy|[NAME] loves (the taste of) people

neutral|I meant the first part. The second part was uncalled for.
joy|"You are also church people. Just ask her out ""Hey my relationship is open and you seem awesome, can I take you out for coffee?"""

joy|Drink up before it gets cold
anger|And people try to hold that against [NAME] when they should hold that against the Packers organization and Front Office...Their Front Office stopped trying, not [NAME].

anger|You are not intereating. You are an annoying cunt who should have never been concieved.

anger|I'm just reminding everyone. you're not helping the situation by being pedantic
joy|I like that, and the baby laughs at the duck so it makes it cute rather than annoying :)
joy|it's an amazing feeling! I love being happy :))))
neutral|[NAME], for when you want to be a healer but also want a FUCK EVERYONE AROUND ME button. Although I‚Äôve been maiming [NAME] recently.
neutral|People need to want democracy in its raw form though. We're too tribalistic for that.
neutral|*sighs* One day Blizzard will finally understand that [NAME] teleport is what needs changing and not his damn passive ability. For now, the dream must remain a dream....
surprise|Woah, woah, woah. You're trying to tell me that elites have a stranglehold in a country with an *actual* aristocracy?!
surprise|Considering that the majority of people who play poker still open limp, I'm surprised these posts aren't more common.
anger|Now ask me if I care. It's irritating and stupid.
joy|I only watched a few episodes, but I loved that guy.
neutral|I can see Smileyboye receiving a [NAME] award a few years down the line.

neutral|Both my kids went down with it about a week ago
joy|I hope you have good people around to support one another.
joy|Which makes zero sense lol
joy|Montreal is a beautiful city
neutral|I don‚Äôt think they are. Haksal was streaming KR ranked just a few days ago
neutral|[NAME] came back week 17. Might be coincidence, but I'd definitely keep an eye on that.
sadness|My entire body aches now
joy|I wish I could forget
anger|If you are not going to kick him out, then don't complain. It is all your choice
joy|All without a red circle, color me impressed..

neutral|Long dead meme dude
neutral|I told him I left cause he couldn‚Äôt do this with me or for me
neutral|Nobody is ever the only one to think anything.
joy|You are correct. I was mistaken. My apologies. I appreciate the correction.
neutral|It's not better or worse, just different.
anger|Except [NAME], he somehow defies any common sense and sometimes he comments here.
neutral|beat me to it. indeed
neutral|Dont ask about Missouri. Ask about the towns in South Carolina already disapearing due to rising sea levels.
anger|Damn [NAME] let himself go
joy|Hahaha! Omg, that‚Äôs so funny. Thanks for taking one for the team. I heard it was bad but not that bad.
joy|Thank you. Message me.
joy|I hope we trade [NAME] for something so I can go cheer for [NAME] on a better team.

neutral|"I said ""try."" Red wine is a thing for a reason"
joy|Obviously a flying monkey somewhere. What a nightmare that guy is. I'm glad you cut him out of your life.
joy|Ohhh, thank you for enlightening me üòÇüòÇ
joy|That one is much better.. you win :(
anger|My shirt is [NAME]. My balloon popper is the DNC. And then [NAME] is the fire under my ass to dive deeper ever day.
joy|Well sure his one appearance in relief lost us a game, but at least he didn‚Äôt get hurt.
joy|As much as I like [NAME] and want him to score so many (hes a speedy mofo) I think that this would be a good trade for sure
joy|He is probably taking it slow to change thinks. I just hope that he is not an actual fan of [NAME] system. That would be a disaster

joy|My girlfriend and I watch it all the time and love making love while it‚Äôs playing in the background!
anger|Nah, I think it's being as dull as a butter knife.
neutral|This is almost as effective as posting that sweet photo of [NAME] old band
anger|looks like your fake autism you used to use for attention still has its side effects :/
neutral|[NAME] needs more love
anger|Nobody likes you
neutral|I think it‚Äôs one of these softballs
neutral|If there's less than four employees, this was not illegal discrimination unfortunately

surprise|"Don't you have a cashier to hassle somewhere? Go find something without a price tag and then tell them ""I guess it's free!"""
anger|these [NAME] impersonators are getting terrible
joy|Mind boggling. Truly. This is the same deal SHE negotiated. Why didn't she find out if her party would back it BEFORE she signed it?
joy|Roses - still gives me goosebumps till this day
surprise|It's some freaky stuff for sure!! How legitimate do you speculate the experiments are?
neutral|[NAME] needs to come in now. There will be so much space for him
joy|"I agree. You can support a cop getting some pushback from a prole without supporting the one doing said ""pushback""."

sadness|Very sad. People like this are ruining Aus.
joy|oh, it's free with prime now, added to watch list.
neutral|I am a young teenager and can‚Äôt drive. Plus my mom would not take me to their places even if they were doing something.
neutral|[NAME] is invaluable. Kawhi mama love him. Kawhi love him. His bow-legged ass is finally playing like NORMGOD again. He stay.
anger|But we love how they enslave, rape and decimate civilizations in the name of [NAME]. You guys just don‚Äôt get it and are probably racist.

neutral|Taking some midol! Gift from [NAME].
neutral|"What to expect from a book author that has nfc that there is no ""3D"" in Unity's name."
joy|If this is true, then we should be having kids out the ass
neutral|Well let‚Äôs research it. Apocalypse started 2003. [NAME] was 8 then. [NAME] is 11 in S2, so around 2005-2006.
neutral|All seasons premise
neutral|[NAME] got bigger plans ahead from the looks of it. I see [NAME] in the senate if any democrat has a chance in Texas.
anger|Nobody forced [NAME] to take [NAME] over [NAME], if he liked him that much then he should‚Äôve just taken him.
neutral|oh my, the edge. i bet he comes with a pre-selected punisher skull emblem.
joy|Similarly, the Library of Congress is open and is absolutely beautiful. It's free and I highly recommend it even when the Smithsonian's aren't closed.
joy|I hope for your sake you don't include Frazzles in your ostracising.
anger|No that's communism not socialism. There's a difference between them.
neutral|The only way this works is if [NAME] is doing the Bird Box challenge and cant see the terms of the contract.
neutral|I've never seen anyone in a political discussion admit to being Russian though. [NAME] has made no secret that she is Canadian.

joy|Needed that. A [NAME] ridiculous play is a game changer
joy|Thanks, that's exactly what I needed to hear üíú
anger|Do you think he is guilty or innocent, no need to use triple and quadruple negatives here
joy|One can only hope
sadness|Good deeds don't buy off being shitty. This is why [NAME] is remembered as a monster.
joy|I hope xe had a nice talk with the premier
joy|It was tough at first, but I'm slowly learning to love again.
joy|So that‚Äôs what it looks like when it‚Äôs not a flop
joy|This is so damn cute, I love it!
joy|Lmaoooo how‚Äôd you miss him that close üòÇ sweet justice
joy|Today I saved lots and lots of people from being raped by me. Now I really *do* feel created in [NAME] image.
neutral|That‚Äôs what I said.
joy|Yeah, but I just don't want to pay for a full blown wedding, those can get expensive.
anger|The general rule is that [NAME] is talking rubbish whenever he opens his mouth.
joy|Let's be honest here if [NAME] played last night the Canucks win. This defense is a major concern and needs a complete overhaul this offseason.
joy|This was amazing
anger|I just don't like our options in the off season.
surprise|im surprised you didnt try to go over her head to the owner or did he just not care about what the new GM was doing?
joy|Hahah. I wish I could say that‚Äôll get less painful with time but it won‚Äôt. Sorry my dude. F
joy|Great, now this song will be stuck in my head for the next 2 weeks.
joy|Agreed. Was just pointing out the rules to OP.
joy|Happy cake day friend

neutral|Makes way less mistakes than [NAME]
joy|Lol oh shit everyone turn around
neutral|If they wanted to help, they'd do the smallest bit of research and see that it's a horrible thing to say.

anger|This primary doesn‚Äôt deserve this nice birthday.
neutral|Can we also get some love for torb? Give his turret deployment the same treatment while we're at it.

neutral|This is not true, you can still cross train to short fall career fields at the half.

joy|[NAME], I‚Äôd like to buy a letter A...
surprise|What happened with the guy at work?
sadness|I made some super dumb decisions as a teen. Thankfully nothing life affecting. Source: was teen

joy|Very cool thanks!
joy|Happy birthday! Enjoy your day and [NAME] should close this out as a present :)
surprise|Understanding of human nature has. Believe it or not, people thousands of years ago might not have understood the world perfectly.

joy|Yesterday I remembered that this game existed and was happy that I waited and didn't buy into a game that would be dead in a month.

surprise|I'm ordained. When's the wedding? üôã This is a terrible idea. I don't know what I'm doing.
anger|I hate when people Beijing a gun. Even worse when they Shanghai one.

neutral|I never thought to put protein into my oatmeal. I may try that tomorrow.
neutral|> Gold diggers barely exist. Right -- that's why most first dates tend to approximate a debtor's examination or an IRS audit.
anger|The car analogy is silly because car problems are physical and material and hence clearly factual diagnosable. ‚ÄúToxic masculinity‚Äù is a squishy theoretical concept.
joy|Well that just means that red hair isn't a valid hair color, just a mutation. We should just count them as brown instead. /heavysarcasm

joy|When [NAME] shoots FTs you can really see the belly of that guy in the front row. It's awesome
neutral|You forgot to block the name in the tweet they're responding to
surprise|Ah, I didn't understand the context.
surprise|Do you feel like being with him is the only way for you to be okay, then?

joy|I mean purely in the context of these pants he isn‚Äôt wrong
joy|This comment is way too far down. It should be the top comment.
neutral|I‚Äôve made snapchats like this for friends

joy|Love how they all claim no one pays any attention to the comments then acknowledge a comment section personality.
joy|This just made me laugh loudly in public causing uncomfortable stares.
fear|This is scary to know that you went through. People like this are one step away from coming home with a gun or knife.
anger|and op is NOT self deprecating
surprise|I wonder if the paintings he did on Brooklyn 99 were actually his.
joy|Wow. I have to say, I am relieved. Pretty incredible idea.

joy|That's interesting I can definitely relate. I ask going to ask if people are cis too but I didn't wanna confound gender with sexuality
surprise|Enjoy spending yours oblivious and phony, slowly realizing as time progresses how very wrong you are.
anger|There is a difference, because unless something had given them encouragement, they'd still be feeling negative about it.

anger|Definitely not. It would be so boring to have no chance year after year.

anger|>hasn't been any form of arrested development Well fuck
joy|Oh, haha Gladstone is a town in North Qld Australia as well... thanks Reddit

surprise|I really want to see the paw prints.
neutral|Some sort of f***ery is going on here.
anger|There's those people that compliment me all the time and you can tell it's so forced and fake and I honestly dont know what to say
sadness|I'll think about prime, just heard a lot of negative about them that spooks me some.
surprise|Have you been to the doctor to get checked out? Could be low thyroid.
joy|Except... that's exactly what I was taught in [RELIGION] school. One god, theee aspects.
neutral|I was going for r/truthtoirony
anger|there's no ventilation shafts in the dumb things, block the exits and make a bonfire.

neutral|This spring is so loaded, it's almost too much at once!
neutral|Update us?
neutral|Hey this is from blame the controller‚Äôs video
surprise|I understand that there are issues. However, if someone chose to stay away from Perth due to the violent behaviour then where would they go on holiday?
joy|You shouldn't skip to any scene. This is a masterpiece from start to finish.
fear|thats terrifying. how can people do that to their own citizens?
anger|Stupid sexy squidward
surprise|Oh right. I can probably google it. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs in horrible taste, but I‚Äôm like dying to know now
neutral|Yeah, something them young‚Äòns won‚Äôt remember
neutral|The wilderbeast only hit muscles so they patches her up, cleabed the wound and gave her antibiotics
joy|Interesting. I‚Äôm not a troll.But if it makes you feel better...
anger|It's also why someone I know is working on becoming an orthopedic surgeon. It's very grim and morbidly lucrative in the US.
joy|Arguably this post is [NAME] favorite post on Reddit one hundred percent. Lmao #muglife
joy|Wow! That sounds like an interesting dream! Thank you for your perspective.
neutral|Wolf and her dog ‚ù§Ô∏è

anger|Not a doctor but I don‚Äôt think so. Carbon monoxide displaces oxygen, but it doesn‚Äôt destroy lung tissue that i know of.

joy|Thanks for this. I was about to relapse but am still going strong.

surprise|Well it looks like I am going to spend at least a year renting to check the city out
neutral|They leave me out of everything
joy|They didn‚Äôt take it; you abandoned it. A TSA agent clarified that for me once. I hope you can replace it easily.
anger|"i dont think theyre planning beyond ""screw over them liberal educators that are ruining our children with their sjw bullshit"" themed rants"
joy|Part of being an adult is putting awkward on the back burner because some things are more important and need to be said.
joy|Then you should probably get out more.
neutral|They just made an ad that made men out to be some sort of deranged sub-human, incapable of understanding right and wrong
surprise|"Even worse: ""Share something interesting about yourself."" Suddenly I become the most boring person ever to exist."
joy|Oh cool it‚Äôs another episode where lefties forget about consent
neutral|Maybe inappropriate, but [NAME] mamma can get it.....

anger|Lol I‚Äôm just fucking around I can wait

neutral|Too sore to make dinner tonight. Wong's Kitchen it is!
neutral|Well call it aesthetics or whatever but the game hasn't made a jump graphical wise and animation wise in a long time.

neutral|The truth is, there is no spoon.
joy|[NAME] has been playing pretty nice since he's been freed from dnps

joy|Bless your dog!
surprise|I don‚Äôt think there are strippers necessarily, but it does make me question what he wants to do without me there
anger|I've done that in the past. It means he's stupid drunk and is missing you at the moment.
surprise|Why are you assuming the guy will be locked up? What terrorists have we released from prison?
anger|But you'll downvote and complain but not provide any reasoning for your complaints? You sound like a child. Grow up.

neutral|I‚Äôm still waiting for 4 EBT withdrawals marked complete on Dec 7th 2018. Later date EBT withdrawals were paid oddly.

joy|I wish your mom had used the stick on his mom and explained that she has to be allowed to do it because otherwise she'd cry.

joy|its becoming increasingly concerning that you refer to yourself in the plural.
surprise|Do you have anything special you say to yourself to help facilitate that? I think I might need a snappy mantra to remind myself to chill out.
neutral|Why can't America be this cool?
neutral|Definitely, too bad [NAME] is taking it as an attack on her when it‚Äôs really an attack on [NAME] and his behavior.
neutral|If calling someone ‚Äúretarded‚Äù is perma-bannable, then I should have been perma banned from /r/nfl like 100 times over.
neutral|Wait. Mr. [NAME] was in Got!
joy|Make the fro bigger, and it will be a perfect master piece. Rating 9.9 out of 10
neutral|Oh, because his sideburns were shaped like stars!
sadness|Dudes never show any interest in me irl so I was just thinking about getting a Tinder. Seems like people have much lower standards on there so fuck it

joy|Thats true. Those kinds of drinks can give you a heart attack.
anger|that is not true. I often shoot the rifle round the blast 2 shots from the double barrel. Unless it got changed recently.

anger|I kill him before he kills me during the date
joy|Love the flower, and hope you feel better!
neutral|quality content owo
neutral|[NAME] looks like he is about to commit >!1-2!<
joy|You should probably use that time to make a decent argument not the other thread then, I'm just going to leave you here .
joy|6% of [NAME] is [NAME] so it wouldn't be a shock if he was of this community.

neutral|[NAME] was the only rb I felt no matter what I would draft him, but I think he's one of the very few
joy|We love you!!!!! And we would love if you still made them
joy|Is that how you deal with people you disagree with? Nice personal fantasy you have there.

joy|Guns go off accidentally all the time. Don‚Äôt point them at someone unless you plan to kill them.
neutral|Right, like what was wrong about a backhand there?
joy|Im almost done with season 7 now. This show ans the office were probably my two all time favorite shows.
joy|That's interesting, considering that the other area is Mt. Tremblant, which is a real area of Qu√®bec.
neutral|i ask them if it is a preference or a dietary restriction. never had a problem with it

neutral|r/woooosh I guess... xD
surprise|The medical examiner's office was on-scene at the fire pit from the get-go......so far the investigations looks very different from the TH case.
anger|And then get frustrated when they realize the internet isn't censored and then call for censorship.
joy|ha, hardly. maybe the biggest city. Russia is fucking huge.
neutral|You're implying it by equating occasional defections to every single Republican voting against net neutrality
joy|I could see that nobody wants to be called ignorant. I also learned about the fallacy from [NAME].

neutral|Plastic doesn‚Äôt decay.
neutral|Maybe you should reflect on why the left is full of [NAME]. I would also like your source on TD being white nationalists.

joy|[NAME] is having a visible affect on his game and I love it. I think we are witnessing the development of a future star.
surprise|Apologies but what movie is this from?

anger|I don‚Äôt see anything awful on her. She‚Äôs old. That‚Äôs it.

joy|[NAME] is such a pretty lady. I'm jealous of those huge eyes!

joy|"They had been chanting ""we want tacos!"" Lol"
joy|Thanks for the advice man ! Have a great New Year‚Äôs Eve

joy|When asked about my hopes for the Wild, i always (half) jokingly say, ‚Äúi hope my grandkids can see them raise their first Cup‚Äù
sadness|We, the fans, are the losers here.

joy|They gave me free Subnautica which is an incredibly wonderful game so I'm pretty darn happy. And it's not exclusive.
neutral|Being gullible to anything and anyone [NAME]. Giving to televangelists and getting caught up in MLM schemes.
joy|Someone on r/nba said [NAME] was borderline elite defensively...lol

anger|your joke sucks
joy|Sorry to link it here but would love to get some opinions on this post
joy|I was scrolling through and thought ‚Äúwho is [NAME]...‚Äù for a minute before I remembered. It was the best 10-20 seconds of my life lol.
joy|She likes her dogs despite this incident. But thanks for your input Mr. [NAME].
anger|I think he's a lustful, gluttonous, greedy, lazy, wrathful, envious, and prideful man.

anger|This is the worst I've ever seen. It really is
joy|But her sister is so much better
surprise|Because it seems like a first step on the same road that peope here have taken. I figured you have experience in the matter.

neutral|Hey man, its your roommate; I need to borrow your shaver!
joy|Sport shooting can be done with air guns. Problem solved.
joy|Just be good and you won‚Äôt lose, ez
neutral|Merry F-ing Christmas.
neutral|It was in your op.
neutral|Cook it in a round dish. The taste got confused because of corners
neutral|I told [NAME] not to shoot [NAME] cause I didn‚Äôt think [NAME]‚Äô dumbass would turn his back right in front of her.
neutral|Yeah Eagles definitely had the upper hand in the negotiation but there‚Äôs no way we were gonna waste a season with [NAME] at QB.
neutral|yeah because 10 days ago [NAME] was still playing dumbass
surprise|That literally doesn‚Äôt even look like her omg
neutral|They arent the same.
joy|Been there a few times but not recently. I'm a builder mostly, been behind the scenes and behind a fair amount of big brands since 2008-ish
joy|Thanks! It is too bad we can't suddenly age [NAME] and [NAME] a year or so.
joy|Damn, savage but true.
neutral|Good fun, just dont over do it, or you will get very bored fast.
neutral|I ate the PETA idiot who ate a vegan diet and had leftovers of him. He wasn't as tasty as a cow.
joy|Always interesting to hear how dom mechanics kinda seep into other relationships lol
neutral|Letting it go is the big struggle. For me at least.
joy|Ahhh yes the, their all Russian controlled bots play, a classic in the last few years
neutral|This!!
neutral|I mean if he‚Äôs into it, sure, whatever. I‚Äôm not one to judge.
joy|I am with you. Despite leaving stuff at his place, i am slow but surely done.
sadness|If he saw it as something regrettable and possibly embarrassing, and has grown, eh. We all have something embarrassing in our past.
joy|Hope you had a great time!
joy|Best post ever
neutral|>would of ......
surprise|If charity worked, everyone in the world would be fed and healthy in this precise moment. Also, how are you going to enact basic income without social institutions?
sadness|Sadly no, everything was thrown around the room, and everytime I rebuilt something, it would be annihilated again.
joy|yes everyone does this!
joy|Your wife is smart.
joy|Man, thats ruthless. Lesson learned. Trust me, there will be a time when they actually need money and I really hope you say no.
disgust|Nope. You're a weirdo.
anger|Seriously! Such an odd way to ask a question about traveling.
neutral|Relax everyone i'm sure USPS isn't going to cry because you didn't ship on the date especially if its on a weekend.
joy|So so happy, more than you believe
joy|Inkling main: I like being cheap. It makes me happy.
neutral|Where is [NAME] mentioned in Genesis?
joy|Not even in The Twelve Days of Christine? She was amazing in that.
joy|This picture is as old as Tinder. OP is probably a dog for all we know.
joy|yea I agree, and [NAME] is way younger so has trade value. [NAME] is still an offensive powerhouse but his DWAR is slumping.
joy|The sex must be great.
joy|Also very funny that communists can still expect it to end up in a different end-game. Well not funny though. :
sadness|Not all of us young teens eat tide pods Mom would be sad
joy|Currently waiting for the inevitable gopher collapse into the tight finish I know and love.
neutral|Uh yeah dude [NAME]!!

joy|I like picking beans with grandma.
neutral|yeah but [NAME] as well? unless she's significantly younger than him.
neutral|They don't want to waste the script they used for [NAME] campaign. Because that was such a rousing success.
joy|As one of the greatest Presidents of our time, who stared down globalist trash and made them blink.
joy|Thanks for taking this on. My daughter's extended family on her father's side do nothing but indulge this crap and it's undermining everything.
joy|Ok... if you think its time.... have a fun safe trip
joy|I sent this to my two friends and one said ‚Äúhaha.‚Äù And the other left me on seen : )

anger|Intolerance of intolerance isn't intolerant my dude
anger|Feudalism is statism, dumbass.
sadness|It hurts to look at it
neutral|[NAME] has 6 eyes and will thus be the best actor in the movie
surprise|Anyone have a link to the unedited footage?
neutral|Well aren't you a pleasant person. It was recommended that I share it here, but it seems like you're the epitome of infuriation, huh?
neutral|This goes back like a decade though. He just has the palette of a 4 year old.

sadness|Worst winter ever :(
neutral|But it keeps my head warm.
anger|Do as I say, Not as I do

joy|Yeah no problem. Sorry about that.
neutral|[NAME]? He doesn't steal it, and he acts like shep in me2. But yeah, the picture looks like [NAME], more than a femshep.
joy|NSFW tagged for showing [NAME]. But anyways, I hope you enjoy the video!
sadness|I am so sorry that happened to you.
joy|Ahhhh the good old anecdote
surprise|Yknow that is one of the main reasons farmers have a lot of kids right? Cheap labor.
joy|Damage values would be fantastic. I also really appreciate having detailed kit information. We no longer use attachments so listing specializations would be nice.
joy|As a non-legalistic [NAME], I wholeheartedly agree. :)
neutral|TIL writing comments on the internet is the sign of a person who thinks he's a badass
joy|I haven't seen it here yet, but I love LetterKenny. It gets funnier as the show goes on and it's on Hulu
joy|I liked it because [NAME] is a fat lard and he was pissed off.
joy|This looks so damn cool! I‚Äôd love a shirt like this!
neutral|That might be [NAME] excuse to eliminate her. In a very [NAME] way
fear|I believe that show scared straight was actually a massive failure, it got viewers but concept of it never resulted in the kids actually being 'scared straight'.
joy|The best album.
anger|USE GLOVES YOU MANIAC
neutral|You don't know the lawyers I know and the judges I know. Law depends entirely on who you talk to.
anger|Its like the worlds most infuriating reality show.
neutral|[NAME] would like a word.
surprise|That makes no sense. You know that right?
anger|There where over 40000 stabbings in the UK last year, and this guy reckons these ‚Äúkids‚Äù are just acting tough üò¨
neutral|Slowing down does not equal stopping, the answer to stopping this is at a government level, not praying that corporations want to leave possible profits alone.
neutral|shit lord beerus.
neutral|Might not have the funds after just losing their mother and all the costs associated with that and losing that support system.
joy|I like you
joy|I think I love you mateüòÇ
neutral|RemindMe! 3 hours
joy|Took devils -1.5. Gotta love sports betting in Jersey.
anger|[NAME] was just calling you out for being rude as fuck

neutral|The whole trinity!!
joy|Surely you've seen weirdo then? It makes me laugh Everytime haha
neutral|And every message from her family is the first message. I mean come on!
anger|Wow, I said he doesn't have any respect, it's not exactly proving my point to show how little you have, but thanks anyways.
joy|I‚Äôm gonna love it if that happens to me
joy|I only read the first sentence then came to comments to confirm that something about the author would be the most upvoted comment.
neutral|They just did. Check out the sticky post.
joy|We‚Äòre looking good so far
neutral|And I kinda noticed that [NAME] is a lowkey (bec of the edit) [NAME]. Just clock her reactions to ep1 and ep4 to Manila.
neutral|Never played there but it seems Portland Meadows might be the spot.
joy|That was a bad fastbreak lol
neutral|Juve somehow still managed to get the upper hand in the [NAME] for [NAME] and [NAME] deal. That's some voodoo shit right there.
neutral|can't help but notice his team also gave up 66 points against ... Baker Mayfield
neutral|Hi furious, I'm dad!
neutral|We need to get some away wins now more than ever. 2nd half of the season, no more time to be circle jerking each other!
anger|You didn't come here to debate. You came here to excuse abhorrent behavior.
joy|I thought [NAME] was awesome tonight. That kid is passing on another level. I'd love to see that kid saucing up [NAME] on the PP unit
joy|I fucking love Danbo. Thanks for putting it back in my head, I see my future self there in a few hours.
anger|>Downvote me, you cowards.
joy|I really appreciate this perspective, man.

neutral|Yay Pip!

disgust|And I though Glory Kills were gruesome
joy|cliche as it sounds, it‚Äôs never too late to start. can‚Äôt change your past, creating a better future starts now
neutral|[NAME]: [NAME] didn't say that! (I hate that I agree with her on something)
neutral|Its almost like climate change makes hot places hotter and cold places colder. Jeez, who could have predicted that.
joy|Feels good bruh
joy|I love [NAME]. I hope she can hold on in 2020.
anger|">The Charisma Myth"" It's bullshit too."
neutral|Whew lad they're bleeding employees, reminds me of [NAME] before they bit the dust
joy|That has to be custom, right? I don‚Äôt remember them having any editions like this, looks sweet.

surprise|Just out of interest, what mm rank are you?
joy|Great work hentaipoon!
neutral|What a strange song
neutral|You should check out my comment at the bottom of this thread of why I somewhat support antifa. This comic is obviously fearmongering conservatives.
joy|Omg! I'm just about to post a recipe with turmeric because I ALSO FEEL THAT WAY.
joy|Oh no atleast you found out early. I went to find help a year ago but you know i stopped going to that therapist
neutral|I should have at your list that I only hope he gets elected!

joy|Thanks, we were just waiting for you to come in with the final say.
joy|Your name is amazing

surprise|Enough shit comes out of his mouth, do we really need to put more back in?
anger|Getting upset and triggered over a hat is absolutely failed moral character, and a sign of deep immaturity.
neutral|wow that's next level here. I am familiar with people dangerously going over 2+ lanes and the zebras but I have never seen that in DFW.
sadness|Pregnancy test. No matter how old I am, I am still embarrassed.
neutral|As far as anal- go slow and there is never too much lube!
surprise|What about [NAME] arm ?Is [NAME] replacing [NAME] cannon ? I was more bummed about losing [NAME] arm than his bat .
joy|I was too mad to continue with the second episode lol I see now that he's married and think HOW?
neutral|Stand up for your self once and be really serious it'll stop them
anger|[NAME] dirty talk really just Doesnt Work for me. Sounds silly at the best of times.
surprise|Why would you do something so controversial and yet so brave?
neutral|Our father is looking down on this ugly world from the sky.
joy|Paula Weed is the best troll ever.
anger|I must break you!
joy|This is the best news I've heard in weeks. Source: Albertan where scum like wolves of odin are multiplying like fruit fly's.
joy|And it was out of their control as well for both. That's funny
neutral|I'm not advocating eating the pain away, but bring apples just in case.
joy|> Thank you for participating in the SeattleWA ProcessTM The only process that is messier than the Seattle City Council.
joy|Oh thank you! I hadn‚Äôt even realized :D
anger|I'm also a human being but I can't think of any reason why I would physically hurt a woman.
neutral|No because all you have done is paraphrased the title of the CMV.
anger|Please explain how this is stupid
anger|Not liking [NAME] is not statism. Removed.
joy|I think if we survived during The Blitz I think we'll be alright now.
disgust|That was the worst power play I‚Äôve ever seen

neutral|Oh I'm sure you're fun at parties
neutral|he saw it
joy|Damn Skyrim VR looks amazing.
joy|I love Dlo lol
disgust|I use to work in an office near a 24hr McDonald's. The smell of the place when walking by at 7am was stomach churning.
neutral|now you're getting it
surprise|[NAME]. How are your attempts at arguing reality into agreeing with you going?
joy|Haha, nice try mom. *dabs*
joy|Good stuff man. Love the passion.
joy|I think men take pockets for granted, once you're without pockets you'll understand the pain.
anger|Nah see that's the kind of pessimism that makes you more depressed. Even if they're not genuine you can still take it to heart.
neutral|Reserved for when the wizards blow my 3 team parlay
joy|"The millionaire backers of a no deal brexit will lose an awful lot of money if they do. The patsy""s are doing a real good job"

surprise|Just like that great historical fact about the [NAME] head being used to mark abused women's shelters in ancient Greece!
joy|That. Is flipping Cute. He's definately a dog person.
joy|My daughter attempted in November of 2012. She also still struggles. Glad you‚Äôre BOTH still alive!
neutral|I messed up by trying the sweetened tea. Maybe tea just isn't my thing? Either way, nice to have the choice be my own. [NAME]
joy|State of [NAME] trying to be funny and spelling ‚Äòlose‚Äô wrong
surprise|Because you live in a desirable city? This isn‚Äôt exclusive to SF.
disgust|>testing teenagers for four mystery roles Oh good lord. This is going to be even worse.
joy|Doesn‚Äôt have those thick eyebrows though lol
surprise|Considering you are also a child, I can't say I'm surprised by your edgy hot take.
neutral|It has happened to me multiple times without saying ‚Äúorange man bad‚Äù Do try to keep up with the context
joy|This just made my day! Thanks for the laugh!!
surprise|So hard to believe that this comment isn`t being ridiculed. I want some of what you guys are smoking.
sadness|Headline had me thinking the guy was currently barricaded in a BK bathroom, demanding they give him free food. But no.
neutral|[NAME] is just pretending to be uncoordinated while he plots to end careers
joy|Comes from [NAME]. I love the seduction community.
neutral|I was kind of rooting for him to get stuck.
joy|This reminds me of the wallpaper someone posted here a while back, great pic OP!
joy|Never stop playing them! I love going against Legions and never see them enough in this game!
sadness|Just like how one day a magic unicorn might appear and prove us all wrong about them not existing.
surprise|I'm shocked you still have service. Mine doesn't play, they are cold.
joy|So you think I can not find it anywhere? I love that sweatshirt yes you help me! thank you!
neutral|Of course. Hang in there <3
joy|I‚Äôve only been there once but really enjoyed it!! But I think it‚Äôs missing a pool table ;)
joy|This was ten years ago...but I have faith in people to be nice. Knoxville was amazing when I lived there.
anger|I don‚Äôt know her, I just thought it was funny how the titles of that post and the post under it went so well together.
anger|This isn't a sport from Holland it's from Frisia, the title is wrong
anger|Because they don‚Äôt want to pay for [NAME]
neutral|There is a reason I said allegedly.
neutral|I haven't confirmed this, but apparently, [NAME] said his trilogy fight with [NAME] sucked because he had an inflamed vagina.
neutral|Part of my heart yearns for a Thief MMO. Instead of a hundred zones, just one densely packed City.
anger|Shameless IG plug:
neutral|There are going to be designated periods where you can make team changes. We just don‚Äôt know when those are yet
neutral|Better than I do about [NAME].
surprise|I don't get it. Are they upset that men aren't all using the blue nametags because blue is the color for boys, or what?
anger|Damn I never had to wait that long. Then again where I live is a town more than a city so much less busy etc
joy|Lmao stopping a tracking working dog haha.
neutral|That sub lost it's way a long time ago
anger|That's beyond fucking creepy!
neutral|can you make a video of her yelling YA HIGH!
sadness|I'm still worried about [NAME] though :(
joy|i‚Äôm happy you were able to have a child! that‚Äôs my biggest concern.
neutral|i heard it was like 300,000 german pows he just sprayed down after shooting his 30 round mag into them.
surprise|I'm guessing this talk will be gated behind the expo pass at GDC. Do these become (legitimately) publicly available after the event?
neutral|Try this on anyone blue belt or above in bjj. Spoiler: it wont work
neutral|My man!
fear|I already called the county I got married in trying to find out about it but they had nothing on either of us about a divorce.. Im so anxious.
anger|No surprise there. It was always his policy to table it upon the deal's failure in Parliament as was set out at the Labour conference.
joy|I understand now. Thank you for your thorough explanation.
joy|Man I'm glad that the caption told me this was hilarious... I might not have know otherwise.

joy|Thank you for reminding me about how much I love the JJBA abridged series.
anger|Ya know, I hate lying but I guess I'd make an exception for this.
anger|Worst CB we‚Äôve had in recent memory
joy|Dear [NAME], It‚Äôs time for the next flood. Thanks.
fear|Oh true I remember seeing it on Spotify‚Äôs charts for weeks. It‚Äôs terrible.
sadness|"""So, I was grading your work and someone spilled coffee on them. Sorry for the mess."""
joy|This is good
joy|I learn things reading about them, but visual triggers also help.
joy|Congratulations, go for a beer and watch a Leaf game on Saturday! HNIC.
neutral|No, those are called natural monopolies. See: particularly the writings of this guy:
anger|Ok. Hang onto shit you can't change and be whiney about it. This is a reason why we catch shit. We can't take it
joy|You can get trough it, it sounds like fucking bullshit, but you can
joy|They are both just so perfect for each other
joy|I think that's more a matter of character's personalities, I think, more than development. But for the rest, I agree.
joy|Thank you so much. I'm really glad you found yourself. I hope to get there.
joy|Sounds like an edgy 14 yo that just had his first kiss
neutral|I bet she‚Äôs gonna bring it. Hopefully they spend more money on the production of the season versus that Schei√üer RuVeal.
anger|No. Just no.
neutral|Adding this to the list of reason why Wales doesn't get the Celtic Union invite when it all goes to shit over there
joy|He looks like a Spanish Solly March, so I‚Äôll assume he‚Äôs as average as Solly is.
neutral|This is a rough sport we follow. Simply training makes you pay the price.
joy|Must be a nice feeling...unless UDG is counted.
neutral|Dude. His wife and baby girl.
joy|You guys rock!
joy|I really wish the conversation surrounding masculinity had just an ounce of empathy for men, rather than just the pretense of empathy for men
anger|Seems like every season she is less hot. Too bad
joy|If only he could‚Äôve known that [NAME] made it out safe and got to live honestly for a little while
disgust|oh thats nasty!
joy|To give him a chance to play somewhere else. Sounds like a decent move by [NAME].
neutral|Doesn't surprise me someone this uneducated would choose to inform the government they are evading taxes.
joy|I‚Äôm interested!
joy|Thank you, this isn't the first time they have tried to control us with money. They always put odd stipulations on money or gifts.
joy|This is a family friendly sub; please don't say the McC-word.
sadness|I've got no place else to go...
neutral|You are aware. That in other countries this doesn‚Äôt exist right? Also a culture is something else than my boss made me do it.
neutral|Be confident when you‚Äôre breaking the skin! If you hesitate, the vein is more likely to roll.
joy|Thank you for commenting exactly what I was going to comment and saving me the trouble!
neutral|I some times add a little sriracha when a I'm making a gochujang based sauce, they have similar flavor profiles with that hot and sweet thing.
joy|I‚Äôm actually feeling these commercials. Especially the young dancer dude haha. This is how you advertise to your demographic!
neutral|That k9 cop is such a bad ass Look at him carry this guy
joy|Thank you for educating me. Lol
sadness|You forgot about cats. They‚Äôre all talking about their cats.
anger|I think [NAME] is honestly just a whack job.
joy|Your description fits the type of SB I prefer. I don't see short hair as a negative.
joy|The majority is not relevant: it was advisory. I agree a second vote is needed to kill the [NAME] trope.
joy|My cockatiel is sitting on my knee. I gave him a hug and promised no more pets.
surprise|What kind of prison sentence would he get in Australia for that?
neutral|There's no L in cyrillic. They were so close.
neutral|People are kind of turning on it, seeing it isen't just hard, but has a lot of issues within the core design that turn people away.
joy|im sure he started that line with his own hard earned money
anger|She wasn't fucking running, no matter how hard you insist. You'd make a wonderful Qld cop with that mentality.
joy|This is a hige step! Congratulations, and looking forward to hearing about your recovery. You have a whole new free life to look forward to :)
joy|You can do it, I believe in you!
joy|Yeah, you should probably get some help first and take a break before going back.
neutral|If you wanted my honest opinion, you seem to be a shallow person. But that's just you and there's nothing wrong with that.
joy|Thank you, how epic is your curl?
joy|Yeah...I mean I love him! But he is to smart for his own good lol.
neutral|Welcome. We eat our own.
joy|He looked pretty into it when talking with [NAME]
sadness|Your body, your choice. Sorry it had to mean the end of the relationship. But it's better now rather than later as tensions grow.
joy|Pretty much. The key difference is that bunnies thump.
joy|They all clapped.
joy|From one finale to the next finale should be one whole year so she‚Äôs gonna be pregnant for a whole year lmao
neutral|Shhhh, let him be special
neutral|There are a lot of QVC hoarders out there. I have an obscene amount of argan oil. I've mostly curbed my hoarding now.
anger|Given the horses ass you lot made of the last one, I think it‚Äôs best to put this idea on the back burner.
joy|These are the same people who make fun of single women who own pets.
neutral|and now her mask is on. make up yer mind
neutral|I actually day trade blue chip stocks whenever I get the chance.
surprise|When you've been dodging as much as [NAME] has, to this challenge, ppl start to 2nd guess and lose faith in you.
anger|Geez those heroes..
joy|Holy shit. Thank you everyone. Thanks for the gold and silver :)
joy|You ok bro?
neutral|#But it's their looks!!!
joy|This might be my favorite scene in the whole series
neutral|I think what's more gross is you taking a picture mid stream....
anger|I don't think that makes for a fair deal. That $100 is far more valuable. It's more of a disposable income thing for me.
surprise|Idk my brain doesn‚Äôt process what I‚Äôm watching if I can‚Äôt read along at the same time
joy|Oh, thx for clarification!
anger|Crocodile tears.. üôÑüêä

joy|Thanks bot! The water looks so weird now
joy|Bit of a rant there, but I get it. This comes off as super pretty.
neutral|Ah I see
anger|But then they can't draw the m word
joy|the best places are immigrant restaurants. cheap and delicious food. the better ones are outside of downtown.

joy|Someone just vandalized this poor guys car in the target parking lot lol
neutral|Doesn't a business account also increase the amount per month that can be transferred back to your bank?
neutral|idk if you're saying that I'm shitposting or that whataboutism is shitposting. But obviously i'm not nor is calling out whataboutism shitposting.
anger|And please do not dab unless you are at bingo.
surprise|Oooh, THAT Shaggy!
anger|Thats harassment brotha. Do you double dare me
joy|No kidding, one way or another they'll get much better this year.

joy|I'm not searching for anything, but even though I'd like them to be, I don't think anything I'm feeling is justifiable.
neutral|Very irony based.
anger|This is what happens when untrained people playing at being detectives and judges run into actual detectives and judges.
anger|Almost downvoted you just because that made me so angry.
neutral|Wheres [NAME] to make sense of all this?!
joy|"Nothing makes me exit a video faster ""looking at this made my nipples hard"" üôÑ"
surprise|Realizing that thirty isn't old at all.
joy|Congrats! Make one extra payment a year and you‚Äôll have it paid off in 15 years instead of 30.
anger|Say what you want about me, I can take it... but stop slandering poor defenseless [NAME]...
joy|I have vision issues already and I kind of freak out without sound. I'm gonna have to say blind.
neutral|I'd say more r/trashy than r/insanepeoplefacebook in my opinion
joy|That's a hot pic Shame she'll kill us all
joy|I like the fact that you like it a lot.
joy|What a thot*
joy|Thanks mate!
disgust|Self defense should be, and this man sexually assaulted this woman.
disgust|Even weirder way to spell [NAME].
joy|I'd expect this from an actually attractive person but this is just lol

joy|I fully endorse the oppression and eventual extermination of all gamers.
joy|You're not wrong. Hahaha
anger|Nope, nope, nope and HELL NOPE!
anger|Maybe 2 years ago the time wasn't right for your relationship and now it is. It's been long enough to give it a second chance imo.

neutral|Might want to avoid those things even when [NAME] and [NAME] are kissing each other.
surprise|And why do you have low self esteem?

neutral|Only solves her loneliness though, that kid is not reproducing with anybody. Unless they're not the only ones left on Earth.
joy|That chick at the end. She just gets sucked onto the floor by pure sexual magnetism. üòÇ
joy|It never came into my mind that I'm being edgy, my friend. I'm not worried.
neutral|No lights are a problem for the people in front of you. Not the offender.

neutral|I think it has more to do with them deriving a sense of identity from work. Remove the work and what remains?

neutral|If they did, they wouldn't be LURKERS LURKIN'
anger|No the limiting factor is the leader raped a young boy and paid his silence

surprise|blocking [NAME] run ? Very bad
neutral|Come on [NAME], time to step up

joy|Oh yes! You're great.
joy|Well that makes it easy. Thanks again. I'll look into it.

neutral|Sounds like she wants dessert, but hates you eating any cake.
neutral|The cost of centralized mandatory services is an example of socialism driving up prices. Get your facts straight.

neutral|Did nutmeg trip once when in high school. Unbelievable how trippy it was. Made time to super slow too. Key word: ONCE
sadness|It's not cool that so many are going without pay and unable to make rent or buy groceries. Is a travesty that a manufactured crisis has come to this
neutral|Big game tonight
joy|I like your answer and good on ya, love me some [NAME]!
sadness|I needed to read this because I felt so bad for this guy... I just can't imagine a long walk home in winter.
joy|Happy cake day :)

joy|I just moved to the big city, you reminded me to check in my local area now, just reported 4! Thanks!
surprise|I have had this same bug once as well. Idk what caused it, but it fixed itself next
joy|"Here's another message ""You're a good mom. Your boy is lucky to have you."""
neutral|[NAME], [NAME] 4 u..... enjoy

disgust|also a harsh NOOOO when disgusted
joy|Glad you enjoyed! Come on down on Mondays. We have trivia and all the burgers are $6!
joy|Prices there appear lower than Banff and it would only be a short drive, thanks! I'll continue my research into Canmore.
sadness|I‚Äôm disappointed that no one has suggested taking her up Oxo Tower yet.
joy|Even for an infidelity sub this is heavy. I hope you find peace somehow.
joy|It's great that he was banned and your coworkers helped you out!! :D
neutral|The master will not be pleased.
joy|Great Expectations!
anger|You fool, you have no idea that you talked about team fortress all along!
neutral|Where do you see that? There's a big red spot on the left side, not the right side.
joy|"I was just thinking to myself ""maybe I should get Tinder"". Thank you for reassuring me that, nah I'm good without it."
sadness|Slathered in blue cheese. [NAME] is so jealous.
neutral|One of the best single-hour segments of the show I've ever seen! I hope the next two are just as good! Let's go!
anger|When people bring up rape culture they mean stuff like this. Because yeah it‚Äôs been out and swept away and not raged over
joy|If Wacky Races kept on going it would have 100% adult viewers
joy|Yeah I can't imagine who wouldn't want to come out first to such a supportive friend
joy|Love hearing [NAME] talk about money not gonna lie.
neutral|and how does that person's notoriety make the other kids who are treated the same way feel any better?
neutral|Nah not today
anger|She really does and She really isn't! She's an old, tired ass, busted up, con artist hoe!
sadness|I'm so sorry that [NAME] has convinced you that his insane aggression isn't important.
surprise|Not sure how you got that outta my post. I play a lot of non-meta stuff all the time just because I find it fun or challenging.
neutral|Anybody that puts that many numbers in their handle is an obvious psychopath.
joy|Cool, I suspected that but I didn't really wanna waste a round. Thanks!
joy|I like him in Friends from College too!

neutral|10 life hacks you didn't know you needed in your life
joy|Omg this is the best idea I‚Äôve ever heard for a rework
neutral|That one guy barley touched the car and it stoped
joy|You are so pretty.
neutral|A backhanded and complicated way of saying you look androgynous.....so you're getting there :)
neutral|This live thing is so bad that i just poured a tall glass of scotch on a work night because there‚Äôs an hour left.
joy|Neat stuff!
joy|I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs gone from Detroit, but good on him for being a professional on ESPN.
joy|The bot did its job. It‚Äôs me the awful one
joy|Welcome to eb games
joy|I knew this was coming! Amazing!
neutral|Nursing school is wrong on that. Still, sickle cell is really, legitimately painful. Give the Dilaudid.
neutral|Don‚Äôt tweets have to be formatted a certain way? Only thing I can think of
joy|I feel like I know her. Is this Tampa by any chance?
surprise|Some of my posts got removed because of rule 1 despite them clearly being about [NAME].
anger|But balance does not include the dark side
anger|You sound angry.
neutral|He downloaded Wealthify
anger|No TV Party for you üëé
neutral|Yo gg man I was the lobby
neutral|This is what I'm thinking of doing. I just thought tafe was the go to.
joy|Considering I only play in a 4 man group across most games. I'm good thanks.
joy|I‚Äôve been to two locations and the burgers are SO GOOD!!
surprise|Ah it's the old one. First I can remember! Of course not the first. Or the last. Hard to keep track at times...
neutral|Also the referee can send off a ballboy if he feels like they've committed an offence worthy of that.
joy|Boy, I literally didn't expect anyone to respond to this. Thanks, internet! I feel a tiny bit less alone.
neutral|[NAME] would be a disaster for the progressive movement. [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME], not much better.
joy|I laughed several times
joy|Another nipple man, we should form our own Subreddit
joy|I agrew. I have also had these many times and they always have a lot of ice cream.

neutral|if you don't wanna identify yourself...
neutral|He's just a money grabbing midget
joy|It was great, and it still is.
neutral|I think majority of people who made WarCraft 1-TBC, Diablo 1-2 and StarCraft are no longer there.
joy|a really cool acrylic painting of this same picture!
joy|Thank you for your support!
joy|Don't worry, with a lifestyle that requires them to have a new hip before the age of 20 they won't be making it much further.
neutral|no. Queef is vaginal period. I call it mumbles, when the lips move but you can't understand what they are saying.
neutral|Hi [NAME]!
joy|LOL [NAME] you're too loveable for that. ‚ô°
joy|I couldnt help but laugh out loud. Pure stupidity coming from the mother. No other way to put it
neutral|During [NAME] and [NAME] cross examination, [NAME] never contested the finding of the key. Never accused them of planting anything.
neutral|How do you know what he can conceive of? Enough magical thinking.
neutral|I don't think any game mode has a guarantee anymore. I five stacked last night in unranked and waited 15mins for a game. TL feels the shortest
neutral|They say water feels like concrete if you hit it hard enough.....
joy|school is not that bad
anger|I hated broccoli until my parents tapped into my obsession with dinosaurs and got me to pretend I was a brontosaurus
joy|Great to hear something positive for once! Was half expecting a negative rant. Yay for [NAME] and congrats to you.
anger|I don't particularly want an Eagles repeat either. Chargers, Colts or Chiefs would make me feel best. Then Rams and Saints.
anger|Fuck the fucking refs. Seriously. Fuck those fucking cunts. I'm so fucking mad. Fucking dickless fucking street walking fucking sluts.
neutral|i legit made a one note notebook on intimacy cause i was/am still struggling with giving affection reading signs

neutral|Exactly, doesn't matter what he or any other expert says. They refuse to listen.
joy|I always seem to date men with long hair and a beard. Often with blue eyes.
neutral|I mean most players get that
joy|Thank you for the advice. It is really really appreciated. üôÇ
neutral|I wish [NAME] nothing but the best. I certainly won't ever forget his passion for the Mets.
joy|Heard that too lol. And how [NAME] is fantastic on the ball, but the lack of assists puts him down as a player .
sadness|Agreed. Sadly, it's not uncommon enough, and it makes me sad because of the implications about mutual respect or the lack thereof.
sadness|delusional about dread being a scam (don't know how this would work) and more of these conspiracy theories with zero proof/
neutral|[NAME] still pulling in the numbers. Doubt we'll ever see [NAME] on PPV again but [NAME] is still a draw with the right opponent
neutral|It makes more sense now.
joy|I love the '1000 paw slap' at the end.
neutral|They are wingers. [NAME] is not. That's about I it tbh. Also they are loans and we may not keep them.
neutral|Didn‚Äôt they change his name and give his younger brother his original name? I think they did this is Game of Thrones too.
joy|This is the best one yet.
neutral|So does [NAME] :(
anger|I feel your pain. Sitting here wallowing in self pity and anger at how I let myself go!
anger|yet another infuriating loss, against a garbage team no less
sadness|I hate my life
neutral|Or just, y'know, just don't eat meat.
surprise|I said I'm curious to see how many women would do it.
sadness|Must be nice my seats were in that area... sadly I decided to go to the bathroom. #PTSD
neutral|Other than Moose, the American Robin took me forever to find.
anger|Glad I wasn‚Äôt the only who noticed. Annoyed me slightly.
anger|Eh, I'm not a fan of the grayscale. Looks too Kingsish.
anger|Not sure why you got downvoted so hard when everybody above is saying the same thing.
joy|Looking super dope!
joy|Fair to say I won't have to pay pipebomb 10ETH. Happy New year, all!
joy|Just found out. Thanks for the tip.
neutral|You‚Äôll see why it‚Äôs a trap once you see the bill.
anger|So basically what we have is a horribly exploitative business model meant to prey on drivers by tricking them into accepting unprofitable rides.
surprise|Oh this is that one he posted a while back with the dinosaur and flowers ü§¢
neutral|That‚Äôs what I would ask if I was Cruz Azul considering the caliber of player [NAME] is and what you guys got for [NAME]
sadness|he‚Äôs not happy with me
joy|It's a close one. I'm going to agree with you because look what happens when [NAME] goes down.
sadness|There were rumors for a long time to work out and I ended up making it smaller.
surprise|Oh nice I was wondering if you could mix flavours. I'll still stick to mint though ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
neutral|Don't worry - Twitter isn't the only place I (or they) browse.
surprise|Oh [NAME] imagining this tween screaming yaaass queen at a poor drag queen made me cringe into a ball
neutral|Before we continue, I would first like to ask you what you believe net neutrality to be so that I know we're both operating under similar definitions.
neutral|100% yes
surprise|"That's because it's called LATCH here and most people just call them ""car seat anchors"". Maybe that's why..."
anger|Yes, he needs to sit the fuck down, that's all I have to say.
anger|My friend on PS4 said that if you don‚Äôt stay to kill the bear, you can‚Äôt kill it.
sadness|This makes me wanna die
anger|yes, i fucking hate that.
joy|That's exactly what I said and not arguing in bad faith at all. I applaud your intellectual honesty and hope your sexually repressed dystopia is swiftly enacted.
surprise|Reminds me of that Black Mirror episode where the lady is brainwashed after committing a crime and forced to repeat the same government-made story with mind controlling phones forever
surprise|i had a weird feeling colts were gunna win the SB, should have put some money on it
joy|LOL at this question! If he follows the sub...just read the topics for opinions! I call BS!
joy|That‚Äôs crazy. Depending of the state you‚Äôd effectively be obligated to work for that employer.
anger|you forgot miracle, fake fan
anger|[NAME]. [NAME] and [NAME] just style on these scrubs with fucking mecha Tai Chi.
neutral|The final boss must be a girl who doesn't want to be his queen
joy|Amazing photo. It looks like a watercolour.
joy|Oh my god is this even an possibility? He‚Äôs one of my favorite college coaches. That mans voice is legendary.
disgust|FINISH ON HER!! Seems way more appropriate for a sex doll
neutral|Yeah, that‚Äôs where my friend saw cizikas as well. Hey [NAME], is that you? Lmao
neutral|What film is that from, looks familiar.
neutral|Delete this post before you wake the wolves. It is okay for [NAME] to be influenced by the [NAME] and [NAME], saying the reverse is just stupidity.
neutral|The Evergreen debacle shows how badly that goes in real life. Turns out the Diversity Coalition would actually hack [NAME] into pieces and parade her organs around.
joy|Unless you're trying it with dollarstore shit, don't risk wasting the money. Just enjoy it.
joy|And do they all follow her main account? See, she has fans, they just all happen to be her. Lol
joy|Great podcast called Uncover on this. Highly recommend!!

neutral|But no sex until marriage is one of her rules
surprise|Well. I‚Äôm sick and slept through the game, that wasn‚Äôt the result I expected to wake up to lmao. What happened?
neutral|The deputy declined to identify himself or say what game he was playing. Definitely Fortnite.
joy|Thank you new best friend.
joy|*Oblivious to double standards Haha lucky he didn't have, * must not be a Hypocrite
joy|Come on I think he‚Äôs funny!
joy|Nothing matters. The world was burning when you came in to it and it will be burning when you leave it.
anger|Yes, you just push. I've been having periods for 29 years (bloody hell) and I've never managed to get to grips with applicators.
joy|Please don't use it as toothpaste. It will destroy your teeth.
joy|I am from central pennsylvania and moved to AZ. Phoenix definitely has the nicest expressways in the country.
surprise|What a gift!
joy|[NAME] reaction gives me life. His reaction when they got punched last episode was amazing too.
surprise|At least you can admit you value one innocent person's life over another. What a shock it's the rich politician over the security guard.
fear|Can confirm as my first time commuting by motorcycle in the rain there was hail, then lots of thunder bolts and lightning , found it very very frightening.
neutral|Now that's job dedication. May we all raise a pizza roll to this cameraman.
surprise|Oh wow I didn‚Äôt know their website was owned by Sinclair. I thought that was just channel 2.
anger|What the hell kind of useless annoying bot is this? Beep boop off to hell bot
anger|No. Not worth both whatsoever with what we need to fill

joy|And it's stopped. Training cancelled :-)
joy|I already love [NAME]. [NAME] gorgeous, but just didn't charm me as fast Ms [NAME].
neutral|Brown isn't a primary color, those are red, blue and yellow...

joy|Lol that‚Äôs classic!! Thanks.

joy|Thanks! Edit: hold up a sec. Cowboys?

neutral|Well it was heavily leaning towards breweries and beer in general but we still got to see heaps of other stuff to so thanks!
joy|Your dad is a wise man
anger|He‚Äôd definitely get dropped at some point and then all hell will break loose
neutral|Oh I gets it. Sort of wished these two guys were more of on the same page.
neutral|This needs to be a series. Start a series. For the love all that's holy on reddit, please...make a series.

neutral|Same here. The critical sign and the little chevron only shows up.
neutral|"Yup. ""Tell that to [NAME]"""
neutral|As a former feral child, you can begin worrying at about 14-19. If they're going good by then, they'll probably be fine.
neutral|I want to see that too, but we all know it's not going to happen.
surprise|Ok that's why, I was so confused of why I saw two [NAME].
neutral|Nobody said you don't have the right lmao
joy|Sensationalism as usual

joy|Maybe she‚Äôll think it was cute how shy you were
neutral|It always reminds me of those really old SNL skits with [NAME] & [NAME]
sadness|they have died here in canada
surprise|The subreddit has 6 subscribers but 20 online?
joy|As a high libido female, I feel the same with posts from males. It's slightly relieving to know someone else struggles the same way.
surprise|Do you know why their airships have sirens? Edit: It's LASD
neutral|You are a sad person
joy|Yeah with this and the other thread DoorDash is definitely down. Just go home and don't answer any 650 numbers
neutral|This is the big one. If he gets away with this he'll get away with anything. People need to do what it takes to prevent this
joy|Everyone keeps giving me that advice haha. She's happily married to a really nice dude, and she is basically my sister at this point.
anger|That was worse than a movie jump scare. I don't know why but giant squid feel more fearsome than sharks.
joy|I'm the opposite. I love spending time with friends but initiating it always gives me anxiety, so I generally wait for them to do something.
disgust|Even if you were a woman, your personality is so vile and yuck I would happily do 20 years in prison for murdering you.
joy|Yeah I want all our players to have a nice healthy hatred for Texas. Good way to ensure they get hyped to play em.
surprise|Its literally bread on a bread board, whats the issue here?

joy|Oh, cool. That‚Äôs the TF all the little kids like nowadays.
anger|You've added nothing to this conversation and just repeated what everybody else. Thanks for wasting my time.
joy|I actually found the whole screenshot ‚Äì without cropping ‚Äì on r/funny so I mean
neutral|I was there, too. I do NOT remember that, though. Yikes...
joy|While it is unfortunate to hear that he is no longer interested, I hope that this brought some level of closure to you.
joy|I love [NAME]
neutral|Native [NAME] here. Whataburger overrated af.
neutral|Is this supposed to be compelling? Either defend the argument I'm putting into question, or explain why my issue with it doesn't hold.
anger|I‚Äôd rather reply to you, simply because you sound like an idiot
surprise|Is this [NAME] brother??
sadness|Youre not wrong, but that applies to every ad. People are generally getting upset with the message more than anything though
joy|That would be really great, but good luck.
neutral|Would be better if not for the stupid gas mask. Should have had it's own comissar cap instead!
joy|I appreciate the honesty! If you don't mind me asking, what state do you live in?
neutral|It just kind of naturally happens. I've actually had a spontaneous switch in two different relationships, though.
joy|Reminds me of series finally [NAME]. Serious and dashing.
neutral|If that‚Äôs what I saw when I was on the brink it would make me do it.
anger|Most [NAME] don‚Äôt really know the difference. Its an easy boogeyman.
joy|I want the man who makes me pizza from scratch and then lovingly hand feeds it to me. Completely realistic expectation.
joy|Cuddling. Lots of cuddling
joy|I would say the answer is better education, not disenfranchisement based on socioeconomic circumstances, but you do you I guess.
joy|CL...let‚Äôs just hope we can stay in EL for the time being.
joy|Agree. I did enjoy Godless but I was addicted to The Terror. It was full of such amazing character actors.
surprise|Are you serious? The entire site determines what to show you based on upvotes.
neutral|I had a friend ask me what kind of sweats do you have a good week
sadness|Sometimes, I feel bad if I don't every now and then. I mostly talk with her on SC/IG tho.
anger|Well, it wasnt by 31.... So im still mad.
joy|I'll handle what ever comes my way, I adore our children. :)
sadness|The problem is not getting new players but keeping the current ones.
surprise|There are so many posts from [NAME] on here it makes me wonder what people think wholesome means.
joy|My fave moments are checking cities and villages and my heart races when I see movement :D
neutral|I remember being a kid, 5-9 years old range, and constantly being subjected to this line when my mother ran errands. This is so dead on.
anger|Get em chief, fuck em, I find those people annoying as hell and I barely even use Instagram/twitter
joy|Glad she's not living in a bubble then....

joy|Nice try hilary but you lost to those idiot minority
neutral|"No....""burnt"" together, just planted in different areas!"

joy|There‚Äôs still hope!

joy|[NAME] loves you. Be yourself and don‚Äôt let bigots stop you.
surprise|Wonder where all the shit is.
joy|Her mother has been visiting the book sales down at Miskatonic university! You apparently have an excellent reading background, and you've learned well!üßõ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíú
neutral|Relevant:
anger|its even worse because the starter kit is like $70 too right? So in reality she probably made closer to $30
joy|That's true. People feel they can't trust anything so they just chose to believe what they want to believe.
joy|I love how the sun just decides its going to pull Australia from Earth and cuddle with us... If only it didn't burn so much.
joy|Thank you much better now

sadness|"[NAME] I hate bad mondays at work! He needs to fiind a new job, this one is full of ‚Äùbad clients""..."
joy|What‚Äôs the reference matter if it‚Äôs still insulting? Glad your degree is coming in handy for something.
neutral|Can we have a video tribute to [NAME] when the Jazz come to Atlanta?
neutral|that makes it a really bad stand if you're a hero, though, since jojo villains get a +90 modifier to dog-killing
joy|Wish you did more. Sounds like she deserved worse.

sadness|Depression is being sad when there's no reason to be. Losing two ws back to back now that's a reason to be sad

joy|I picked up smoking again thinking it would aid that void that is working. It just made it worse.

joy|Thank's for the notice.
surprise|I wasn't sure either. I'm 30 and my doctor has never said anything about getting retested or revaccinated.
neutral|That's it. I use a puff but my BF won't, so I'm always buying body wash for him about 3x as often.
joy|Thank you. We literally had stopped her an hour before she made her break.

neutral|The only difference between [RELIGION] and [RELIGION] in this regard is that on average [RELIGION] are poorer and browner
surprise|Bye that's it for me. I'ts all over.
neutral|theirs a diffrence between interaction and literally forcing someone off the stage. The fact that you cant tell the difference shows how desperate you are

joy|Glad to hear it's ubiquitous and not an OS thing.
joy|Put an echo or Alexa under it lol

joy|Thank you. I feel like I‚Äôve scarred her for life, but I know that‚Äôs probably not the case.
joy|It was a dig at OP not you ahah, this video was posted there over a year ago

joy|I wish. Its too tiny to see from up here.
anger|Holy shit it's almost like the PYD is a organization of Syrian citizens I can't believe he exposed them on that.
joy|This blows. But I think [NAME] can do it alone if he gets a home health care assistant.
joy|Polls are closing now! If you're waiting to vote, stay in line! Results should be in shortly!
neutral|WHOSE READY TO PLAY A WILD CARD GAME AT THE TROP
joy|She‚Äôs just overweight. I don‚Äôt see anything particularly wrong with her clothing. Lots of people dress adventurously.

joy|I would love to see spirit in her kimono as well if that,s possible in the future >< I love your work !
anger|No Mayo No Care.
neutral|Depends on what else is going on at the time and the state of Britain economically and globally. But these terms wouldn't currently be popular, no.

neutral|Suddenly it‚Äôs gross
joy|Or just simply hinting at it. All in fun though
joy|What a thoughtful and clever response. I've never seen anyone point out that someone posts in TD before. Very cool!
neutral|Sri Lanka gives a 99 year port lease to China? Didn't England have one of those on Hong Kong?
neutral|Got my Crass tattoo in 1987

anger|This is an incipient antivaxx community, I don't want to see them lobbying and increasing in numbers like in the USA or Romania
neutral|> Marginal tax rate is a fairly sophisticated concept It really isn't.
joy|I‚Äôll be honest, I didn‚Äôt expect that to be real
neutral|He‚Äôd make people? That‚Äôs a lil uncomfortable tho
neutral|I've heard some people get kinda homophobic with the grappling. Sucks when the crowd boo's

neutral|As opposed to?
joy|A joke of a mock and I usually refrain from being critical of other people's perspectives of team needs and such.
surprise|So, it turns out the chants were projection as well.
joy|In doing so, they gave humanity a cinematic treasure for the ages.
neutral|not worrying about being condemned to eternal hellfire for it takes away one impediment.
joy|Seattle's train is nice... once you get there. It is an absolute hike from the terminal

fear|The third picture is creepy.
surprise|That's how mafia works
joy|The website is still up. You want to see this. I've met the guy. He's super nice.

joy|Time to let the justice system run its course.
neutral|They blew him? That's a hell of a deleted scene....
anger|She'll ask them a question, interrupt them to say that something else is coming up and then talk about something irrelevant. She is all over the place.
anger|If liking your own country is a right wing talking point then why don't the left wingers just leave the country?
anger|Literally right after I sent it. What the hell
neutral|I blinked at the perfect moment and thought no one was going to save that man.

joy|I would love both of them
anger|No, not at all.
joy|That's cute. Sincerely Nepal, 7.6
joy|* [NAME] fought for freedom and glory, is one of my favorite characters in general.

anger|there is no compromise with people who hold the American people hostage for something the American people don't want. don't negotiate with terrorists.
anger|U.S. are going to fuck this [NAME] guy so hard...he's going to need help to remove all the stars from his rectum
neutral|What does that mean o____o
joy|It is crazy to me that there are even people in this sub that think [NAME] isn't worth his contract.

joy|We all love to read into data without actually reading the data.
neutral|My problem is I like to get high

neutral|Is this [NAME] working in retail?
neutral|The totalitarian nature and outright hypocrisy and Doublethink of so called progressivism never ceases to

neutral|I do not think it is 'wrong', I just see that the Pluses outweigh the Minuses.
neutral|I like how u/FThumb is pissed that this got linked like the bros don‚Äôt ever brigade other subs
joy|I always do this. They get closer or just move to another lane lol
neutral|Hellz yeah!

joy|My bf just got this too. He's obsessed
neutral|This may look like hyperbole but you would have to be autistic to not pick up on the sarcasm in that post.

neutral|That depends on the area. For a lot places they would need a warrant first.

anger|Means behave like you are a sexual Tyrannosaurus.
neutral|In a thread about six right wing American terrorists you managed to call leftists the violent ones. Incredible.

neutral|... that's inflatin' LAOP's frustration?

surprise|Midnight has been 4/4 pro league teams they have played so far, so I wouldn't be too sure they're gonna be bottom feeders

joy|If someone calls I will text them and say I can't talk right now. No matter what I'm doing.
joy|Maybe try to do some little thing you really used to enjoy. Even if it's just for 5 mins it's still a small victory.
surprise|Can we somehow use them to collect co2? Or at least stretch them a bit to try?
joy|Nice! You and her would get along i bet. She loves her crafty machines and creative people. üòá
neutral|[NAME] has a great bit on this topic.
anger|How can he be cool? Pretty sure he has sexually harassed women.
sadness|God damn I miss this game!
joy|Congratulations! I have 8 months and 23 days! We DO recover & we can do it together! Proud of you :)

anger|"Ah the classic ""I don't deserve you"" argument."
surprise|I was surprised when they sewed them together instead of hot gluing them.
anger|This argument makes zero sense. The same tax exclusions and exemptions that were around when the marginal rate was at 90 are not around today.
joy|i like that she's just kind of meeting people and dating. I wouldn't even really call it a triangle tbh.
neutral|:((

joy|My mistake, after almost 15 seasons it's a little hard to remember. Thanks for letting me know!
neutral|He really should breathe in and out. It also gets hot down there

joy|Couldn‚Äôt find my wallet for the last 4 days. This also happens to be an awesome way to not spend any money.
joy|Strawberry lemonade by ziip pods is the best I've ever tasted.

fear|This is dangerous.
surprise|Are you [NAME]?
joy|And oof for the red car
joy|More excited about the pick than [NAME], but might be nice outfield depth in time.

neutral|Oh, for the love of... The knock goes between the index and middle fingers, [NAME]!

joy|Can you please make one for ps4 with (movie) [NAME], [NAME], and Palp please?
anger|"I'm irritated by the upside down ""Anti Crease"" bit more than anything. "
joy|Fun fact: [NAME] decided to delete an entire string of comments after mine because they made him look like more of a man-child than he already is ;)

anger|"Dog thinking ""shit this guy is crazy, better get out"""

neutral|"Fuck all those ""racist [NAME] supporters,"" amirite"
sadness|Just a reminder in case anyone forgot that UGA got embarrassed by Texas:

sadness|Because Im going to feel sorry for the death of someone who assaulted me. Sure thing buddy.

joy|I‚Äôm going to bed nowish, hope you‚Äôre ok. HMU if you want.
anger|But once again that is a problem with the people. So many just attack the people who disagree instead of the arguments.

neutral|Calm down.
anger|I heard [NAME] makes someone his bitch on a usual basis. Anyone remember how often?
neutral|we live in a wooooshiety
joy|Yeah, that was terrible. [NAME] laughing and joking at the end of that game ended his career here.
neutral|yup it may be me!
anger|I don‚Äôt have to stop speaking fact simply because it‚Äôs uncomfortable for you to hear.
neutral|he didn't even invent it. some random youtube video from 2010 was where it originated from.
joy|I would try to find someone who wasn‚Äôt married and exploring sex parties because...I‚Äôm boring as fuck, I guess.
neutral|And this is a big part of why no chain supermarkets will open in 'underprivileged' neighborhoods.
neutral|The teacher apologised profusely, but nobody could hear due to the deafening applause.
anger|"""There's always a bigger fuckup."""
surprise|It is being talked about all the time on this site. What are you on about?
joy|A million little things. I love it, but cheating arc within first couple episodes.
disgust|Weird headline. 2 children per mother would be expected to shrink the population.

neutral|You dropped this.
surprise|>Star centre [NAME] in the leadership group Oh my

joy|Thanks for an interesting thread. How many of the [NAME] in Malaysia would you characterize as [NAME] or supporting political [RELIGION]?

neutral|Doctor: ‚ÄúI have good news and bad news‚Äù Patient: ‚Äúgood news first‚Äù Doctor: ‚Äúwe‚Äôre naming a disease after you‚Äù

neutral|Nothing will, no, but it gives /r/conservative ammo against a sub like this.
joy|Glad she was a good sport about it.
neutral|It's easier to have a discussion with a four year old. Four year olds actually want to learn new things.
neutral|I‚Äôm totally having a fantasy about publicly shaming someone for giving their server attitude right now. Sweet justice.
sadness|Is it though? All the highschoolers I knew were too broke to be using juuls. Everyone had a suorin and the only ones with juuls were drug dealers.

anger|I am so pissed about Oiler hockey right now. Even [NAME] is annoying me and I love [NAME]. Gaaaahhhhhhh
neutral|Jumps like this are often explained by Twitch front page in certain countries. Every time it happens people get accused of view botting.
joy|great day for him though, awesome story for the rest of the week
anger|Nope. Glad we came out with the W
joy|That makes a lot of sense. I wish I knew how to stop myself from doing it tho
sadness|I never read it, but I sure remember being creeped out by this claymation version

anger|[NAME], I believe you buddy. you might be a weird dude... but no one is weird enough to make up a story that bizarre yet banal.
joy|Ok? I‚Äôm addressing your points here. Don‚Äôt worry though, your reply suggests personal attacks are the way forward.
joy|Agreed, that‚Äôs different if it‚Äôs their choice, but I would suggest against starting off that way!

joy|Id gladly exchange firsts with the Suns
fear|Just imagine Disney characters without gloves. Yes it's that horrifying

neutral|You need to lable your factors or else this is indecipherable.

neutral|And then everyone clapped

neutral|It's not about not understanding it's that you're wrong. It's sexual assault. Rape = person being penetrated. You've been shown multiple definitions.
joy|"Thanks, I'd never heard this information. Only ""humans have the best endurance"""
neutral|Conversion therapy is so wrong. We shouldn't force children to change their sexual orientation or anything similar to that against their will! *laughs in irony*
joy|Had my first kiss last month at 22. It does feel great. Good job bro.
sadness|I apologize if I came across that way, it was not my intention. I meant only to state a fact.
neutral|We all make acceptable compromises to maintain relationships. If that‚Äôs part of you and it‚Äôs unacceptable to him then he can change his choice.
joy|They were and will always be the best couple in the show. Team Slexie for life!
sadness|My hope is gone, too. Sounds like we've both tried over, and over, and over again. When do the realisations hit you?
joy|Wow, way to deflate Endgame's stakes *even more* before the movie even comes out.
joy|Clapping ~~for~~ at me. FTFY
surprise|Have you asked her child?
anger|Agreed, rarely get mad at ones like hun or darl. Being called boy by an old man however is infuriating.
joy|Pretty much. Him and [NAME] will share ball handling duties. Point Lance and Point Outlaw in the house
neutral|I mean, it could work. I might be enticed by a slightly less ugly lady.
neutral|Try not to cringe challenge.
neutral|[NAME] get your racial and gender slurs straight!
neutral|My worry about [NAME] is that running former governors hasn‚Äôt worked out the greatest. Especially when his been out of office for 11 years.
anger|Impossible. A Milford man shall neither be seen, nor heard.
joy|No way, that was brilliant!
neutral|That‚Äôs one big-ass bath candle.
sadness|I think the unluckiest... is [NAME]. :(
sadness|Sorry but what map is Adlersbrunn? Edit: Ah nevermind I see (after zooming in, it is the [NAME] map)
joy|He remains the only serve bot I enjoy watching.
neutral|Unfortunately, he'll never quite see that.
joy|I am really sorry that you are feeling this way. Sending you good vibes and reminding you that you are beautiful.
surprise|That's Crash Chaos Cats. Same username on other networks.
joy|This is the most reasonable and logical response on here.
neutral|If this continues for V7, I'm gonna start getting *real goddamn salty.*
joy|They really need to bring [NAME] son back to do more flashback scenes of young [NAME]. That would be SO GOOD
surprise|Wow, the video is a lot worse than I thought. His actions after he asks for the age is very uncomfortable.
neutral|*Some restrictions may apply. Not valid in the United States. Void where prohibited.
joy|Awesome. Im pretty jelly rn, im on a t-break for a month. Hope you enjoy. Sending positive vibes brother!!
surprise|Did you play Origins? I absolutely loved it, I‚Äôve had reservations on getting Odyssey and I missed the sale on Xbox.

anger|And you're a lame, sorry not sorry
joy|Sidhu Moose Wala. He's pretty big right now
sadness|I‚Äôve been hurt too many times for it all to have been for nothing
joy|We don't have this problem where I live, we use Torrents
joy|Now that is a valid opinion unlike your other ones. Unless you didn‚Äôt read all of what I said.
joy|America is cool
joy|They're all so cute~ Here's mine
joy|I know, all the comments have me cracking up.
joy|Wow I hope TSM keeps this new midlaner they picked up.
joy|thank you for this, i feel less alone now. i‚Äôm glad you overshare on this stupid website :)
neutral|For the people who love [NAME] or found their inner gayness because of him.
neutral|[NAME] for comments on matches.
anger|Because he's in dirt, and probably didn't have much practice
joy|‚ÄúYou‚Äù. Netflix. Thank me later. Hang in there <3
joy|I see that the facebook and twitter crowd is leaking into our sub. Awesome.
neutral|Hidilly ho there neighbourino now stop swearing you [NAME] damn cunt I'm buying my son GTA V
joy|I‚Äôm pretty sure your thinking of [NAME], although I could be wrong
neutral|I'm concerned with optimal health. Not surviving.
surprise|Oh and I forgot to say HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!
joy|But you do know it, so that's good
anger|True but also it's not a dilemma ; if they try something like Tiananmen they will likely die. So not very tempting to try to change things.
joy|I‚Äôm Waiting for Dr [NAME] to bring back Celebrity Rehab so her and [NAME] can be on it.
neutral|It does seem like the Astros get a lot of charity trades.
joy|When [NAME] like ‚Äúshould we have an alien baby‚Äù and [NAME] looked SO happy üòÇüíõ
anger|And he doesn‚Äôt even stop. It‚Äôs your work truck, man! They‚Äôre going to find out regardless.
joy|This goes hard, keep working just a little bit more on it. It feels like a demo to a cool song Love it
joy|I love life, happy new year boys!
joy|I guess we're just gonna have to agree to disagree.
joy|They are, but they're rarer than winning the lottery on Christmas. That looks so shiny.
neutral|Bingo, low tax zones around his mines
joy|Easy answer - nobody knows. And knowing my country we will probably leave it to the last possible moment and then have an ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù moment.
neutral|Add a _little_ sugar to the water when you feed downed bees. Acts like artificial nectar and gives them enough energy to get going again.
neutral|reaper was getting self healing from dealing all that damage
joy|Same except I also love the taste and meal options of meat. I could never do the veggie thing.
surprise|It's just the reliability of a Honda. But I don't know a whole lot.
neutral|Man, what a very tolerant person he is.
neutral|That seems pretty rough. If I ask Google for directions from white center to Fiona it‚Äôs only an hour by bicycle even.
surprise|Which was even more possible 2 years ago. It‚Äôs tougher now than it was with a larger republican majority.
neutral|And then the sock goes into the unknown unprepared and gets lost in the washing machine.
neutral|I was drug tested when I went to otc dm. And that was 2 years ago. They also did another background check.
sadness|The mods deleted it I'm sorry
joy|In an unfunny situation you made me laugh, so thanks üòÖ
joy|Sometimes to do what's right we must give up the thing we want the most... even our dreams.
surprise|How did he kill u with kobolds btw?i wanna know how this was done.
joy|Obviously has played on her mind for that long... glad she apologised
fear|[NAME], that is so horrible. I‚Äôm so sorry for you and OP.
joy|Your welcome. A simple ‚Äúthank you‚Äù would‚Äôve sufficed. Didn‚Äôt need the long-winded response. r/ChoosingBeggars
surprise|Oh god [NAME] has a fucking gun oh fuck
joy|Oooo sounds lovely. Armpit hair on ‚Äúfleek‚Äù
joy|Alright leaving town now. Thanks again. Taking my mom she‚Äôs always wanted to go to a game.
joy|Not really haha Young Living announced that they'll be releasing a CBD oil later this month
neutral|I'd get the call of the void way too hard here.
joy|I like taking 450 every 2-3 hours. Not the best hangover, but lots of CEVs and I enjoy the OBEs, floating thru the dark.
surprise|I CANT BELIEVE HER WIG STAYED ON WITH ALL THAT CAKE!!!! [NAME] tape really does hold back all, y'all. Alaska who?
neutral|"""Smile Dude"""
anger|I couldn't muster up the energy to read through it all. They're on a different level, and it's not a compliment.
neutral|[NAME] to the Fox lady: ‚Äúmy record vs you would be 7-0‚Äù
anger|So we should stop caring about other people and only look out for ourselves. That DOES sound like a baby boomer!
anger|"Must be sad that you waste your time idolizing ""Pros"" and being a absolute poser in front of your freinds "
surprise|Someone who wants to drink like half a pint of Jim Beam, that's who!
neutral|yes Yes YES # YES
joy|I was just watching the episode last night. So adorable.
neutral|> To bad everyone is to ~~weak and comfortable in their homes~~ slaving away in an open air debtor's prison to stand up to the government ftfy
sadness|How poignant.

joy|Great! Thanks for the ideas
neutral|The world needs more [NAME]!
neutral|I thought you were going to say something about that gross toenail on he left foot. She'll need an industrial grinder to take care of that.
anger|Oh lord that's nasty. Guess I'm getting some fried chicken tonight.
sadness|We‚Äôve been watching OP for awhile and warned him about his posts. This one doesn‚Äôt rise to the level we warned him about.
neutral|Phew ...
neutral|> 420 blaze it!! wasn't that the red sox payroll doe? they got their ring.....
neutral|I'm on it!
joy|This is love <3
joy|I remember being 4 and so excited to help pair the socks after they were dried. Kids love being involved.
joy|I think its safe to assume that we're clearly referring to the article and topic at hand.
joy|This isn't cringe at all. He's making a joke.
neutral|"Right, [NAME] here - ""tooting"" = fart or follow through? "
joy|Good. You know which ones you want keep your kids away from
anger|Not enough that the median incomes for those without a degree to be close enough to those that did as to not be significant.
neutral|And the secret weapon, in case of emergencies: TRIPPLE THE OFFENSE!
neutral|But why....specifically?

neutral|It's giving me old school [NAME] vibes.

joy|I never really hated [NAME], but now I love [NAME]
anger|What a useless tool.
joy|I agree. Girls digg when you take the lead on this, Just be upfront.
joy|I love the idea if choosing an outfit based on what kind of person I wanna be that day. Sounds like a fun way to experiment.
neutral|This isn't even cringe this is irony
joy|I'm so glad you're annoyed.
joy|Yup that game was where I was like we have to draft him!!!!!
joy|Very true thank you for the insight, this does help as I need to remind myself this is a new relationship and part of our reconciliation.
neutral|Boy does that hit the nail on the head.
joy|Oh my [NAME]. Yesssss.
neutral|i think [NAME] and [NAME] used to be married then he divorced her when he found she was cheating.
joy|I'm excited for [NAME]/ [NAME] moments. My flair(s)
anger|Wait, apple and [NAME]? Please tell me these fools are all on windows phones

joy|This is a new complaint I haven't seen before... I like it.
surprise|Hey it's been 2 weeks, are your friends still stuck at 60-ish ranks, just gathering info on MM and such.
sadness|Her performance was absolutely awful in the Elseworlds crossover. So much so that every time she was on screen it made me cringe.
joy|Me too. It‚Äôs my favorite. His cadence in saying it is so perfect lol.
fear|Me too! I got scared that I've been laundry inpaired my whole life and never even realized it!
surprise|For 3 months so far. I‚Äôm not sure because I never had any successful withdrawals yet.
neutral|"Actually its ""lots of partners = less likely to form a bond"", yknow, because children. "
surprise|Oh my god.... They used [NAME] voice!
neutral|She called someone from RHONJ a r****d and then doubled down in a particularly petulant manner when someone called her out
neutral|Um hi.
joy|Hmmm...I'm sure you were being very reasonable beforehand.
joy|Thankyou for correcting me.
neutral|If its your first time with dxm, I would take that first and maybe the other drugs on the comedown

neutral|"I can safely say as a ""frozen pizza connoisseur"" across various ovens, I've never had an unevenly cooked pizza from it being on a pan."
neutral|The shattered glass looks like a sassy elf
neutral|Well, I never thought it was entirely coincidence that we got bad when [NAME] went to Ireland and got good again when he came back.
neutral|I legitimately cannot understate on how much I hate [NAME].
joy|I love this sub
joy|Very interesting documentary, just shows how devastating one punch can be.
joy|Agreed haha.
joy|Can we just take a minute to appreciate the thigh. So delicious and so cheap.
anger|Damn, that's low.
joy|There is nothing gross about being gay. Just means we're different, but we still experience love. Love is not gross.
joy|Yeah, they're on whatever the opposite of a roll is today.

anger|i like memes, I just don't like following rules for making memes.

joy|If you are at the stage where you want to quit then all you have to do is believe you can quit
joy|So... I guess I'm the only one who thought she looked so much nicer after that trip to the salon?
joy|Wow, pretty transphobic to say prostate owners have a penis and non-prostate owners have a vagina. What about the neovagina and front-hole bearers? /s
joy|[NAME] bless that batch tagger extension
neutral|You do know trans men exist right? Completely destroying your argument
surprise|Can't tell if bad troll or just ignorant knowitall
neutral|The longest in the southern hemisphere. I always take visiting friends and relatives here, hit them with that fact, and they love it.
anger|Mr [NAME] is operater as fuck
joy|I feel the same man. Keep going bro!
joy|There are millions and millions of girls in the world. You will find someone better, trust me
anger|Yeah maybe shutting down all those barracks near the border wasn't a great idea.
sadness|Not as excited anymore about having the most difficult second half in the NHL...
anger|I mean, it was season two level of ‚Äúwhat the fuck are you doing writers?!‚Äù
anger|I frequently have issues with these large temperature swing but it has to due with allergy pollen activation.
anger|lmao yes, my reasoned, supported response to your unfounded criticism is most certainly an example of one of the points the hack artist tried to assert
sadness|I can't remember a time during my early childhood where I didn't dress up like my mom and almost break my little ankles in her heels
joy|Yeah that happened to me twice a month for years with an ex. Maybe someday we‚Äôll do it üòÖ
neutral|My main issue with Anarchism (although this should probably go on anarchism_101) is that i don't see a difference between anarchism and syndicalism.
surprise|Wait that's a thing? Because that didn't happen when I was young, I don't think
anger|That wasn‚Äôt part of my plan
joy|I‚Äôve never heard him say it but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he did. It‚Äôs believable enough
anger|I don't see much reason for it even as a 2nd.
surprise|That's forward heavy punch right? Sorry I'm pretty new to SF
neutral|Theres no clonazolam in that bottle that vendor sends bunk shit. Im considering suing that vendor for scamming me
neutral|>Israel is literally an apartheid state It's literally not and the proliferation of that accusation is based on ignorance and simplistic understanding.
neutral|Try to watch this without crying.
joy|It's amazingly fun even after all these years. Aged terribly graphics-wise though.
joy|I'll show some love for diazepam! Congratulations on the re up and let me Know if they are
surprise|Didn't the Mets have a .909 win percentage at one point? ^^^^/s
joy|My favorite parody in fact.
surprise|So just tell me I dont want to go look, was the video cut/edited? Or is it RAW? I MUST KNOW!
surprise|People still do? I thought everyone realized how overpaid he is
neutral|That's ironic. Because [NAME] isn't getting the Wall funded, we are pulling more resources off the border blockade effort?
neutral|She's a female [NAME] at this point. She gets paid $30k per day for this garbage.
joy|You don't need to escape to have fun, if you want to win just get some friends to play with.
joy|This is funny though.
neutral|judah!!
neutral|This is so uncharacteristic of him /s
neutral|At least I'll have a normal lifespan
joy|Men find that attractive because it's distinctly feminine. Well, let me add, women who love women love it for the same reason.
neutral|I don‚Äôt even go through a period and I‚Äôm still crippled by random cramps
joy|I guess that depends on the department. If you've racked up a ton of vacay time, it's possible for some cops to smoke weed lol.
joy|Hey, it's good of you to do this, she may be sad but in the end it will be better for her. Proud of you!
anger|"I hate it when the suits call our oncology program a ""service line"""

neutral|Your memeing right o.o
anger|Virtually no happiness anymore, exhausted with trying, meds not working properly and just tired of it all.

joy|Carlton back to back wooden spooners. Champions of the bottom.. :)
anger|Nope. Not how things are done around here.
neutral|Sacrifice them to [NAME]
sadness|It pains me to see [NAME] used in this abhorrent meme
joy|That sounds like a legitimate reason. However she still gave herself a reason to say [NAME] constantly...
surprise|A fatass? Look at him. You think he cares about his appearance? He‚Äôs likely talking about alcohol anyway.
sadness|I know, this weekend was absolute worse case scenario
anger|Yeah no.
joy|Hey, thank you, I hope your issue has resolved also :)

joy|As far as I'm concerned, [NAME] run for the WH ended with this twisted ankle.
joy|Your patience to find the perfect moment is... Please just let me slow clap.
neutral|Not necessarily. Poor people tend to purchase cheaper foods, and have assistance programs that others don't have access to.
joy|Calm down. It's a real concept.
joy|Yes, this at least makes sense.
anger|This shit had me howling, which I can't say happens too often. Didn't expect to see comedic gold in that sub.

fear|The Babylon Bee article makes me worry for [NAME] comic tastes.

joy|I‚Äôm hoping! She wasn‚Äôt bad at all in this episode!
surprise|Why do you guys hate [NAME]? I‚Äôm neutral leaning slightly positive on him. Just curious why the strong negative opinion?
neutral|This happens all too much. The game cannot keep up with so many actions especially if ur ping is bad
joy|Just change in the stall. I used to do it. No one will say anything to you about it it's normal
joy|Thank you so much! After the *loooooong* talk we had, I feel a lot better about our marriage.
neutral|When you buy the dog you get a lot of training to go with it and it's usually then further trained to specifically protect the person.

joy|This doesn‚Äôt sound very constructive so I‚Äôm going to move along but thanks for taking the time to respond.
neutral|I had a similar experience. I used to be masters for a while, and now am GM. People are not very understanding of new GMs.
neutral|I actually heard [NAME] inviting [NAME] and [NAME] to be on her show, after the interview with [NAME] ex wife.

sadness|The fact that [NAME] was not mentioned in this thread confuses and upsets me.

joy|Got it, looks like they're in my vicinity. Will keep this on hand- much appreciated.
neutral|that depends on where you live. you could probably move in with some people to share the costs for a while.
joy|Lol. My gamer tag is the same as on here if you ever want to squad up and play man
neutral|You are wrong but people shouldn‚Äôt downvote you for that. Downvoting people for trying to become more informed is what leads to an ignorant community.
neutral|Ech even if he wanted to just be friends i dont think its okay to just ignore you like that. I think you dodged a bullet.
neutral|And it will absolutely be brigaded by gun but subs

neutral|Now if you could only get people to listen to sane advice like this.
surprise|I‚Äôm just here trying to figure out what trumps head weasel is doing in that picture...

neutral|Makes sense since he usually is the one to clean up kills while others make contact
anger|Two problems: It's not a newsworthy story. You'd get sued for defamation.
joy|Thanks for the laugh lol
joy|Don't be angry. Encountering toxic people in online games is common and you won't change that. Try playing single-player or games with more sophisticated community
anger|Block her.
joy|i‚Äôve heard great things from the people who actually saw it. Thriller is my favorite genre so it seems right up my alley
neutral|* hugs you * there you go bro.
neutral|I had a breakthrough last night and i wanted to share, I hope this helps.
disgust|An attractive woman falling down and exposing her butt. It's weird that he'd go so 0 to 60 on such a thing.
joy|Too slow, I already found it ;) It is a great ad though.
surprise|Randomly watched arrow this week and I think each year is more confusing and I didn't like it! At least [NAME] is still there and always shining!
anger|Yes get [NAME] almost all the way the fuck out of here.
sadness|So we are really going to miss the playoffs in the same season as the 10 game win streak... THEY ARE WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE !

neutral|mmm, yum... ALRIGHT GIMME
joy|Doesn't work for a newspaper. I was just laughing because I said to him that I could see that happening. Opened reddit and saw your post.
joy|why thank you!
joy|Get rid. This is a toxic relationship that is making you unhappy. You are making all efforts for nothing in return.
joy|I was hoping for a new album surprise came out of nowhere when i saw the notification.

joy|i hope i can go my way to my fullest potential one day^^
surprise|Must‚Äôve gotten it the wrong way round because he moves like a spry 82 yr old
surprise|What media is this scene from?
neutral|They were pretty hysterical about [NAME]. Certainly surpassed by [NAME] hysteria though.
joy|This, this is brilliant
surprise|What are you talking about, there was an update this week. And even then 3 weeks is not enough for a huge update
joy|I‚Äôll see you there. I laughed out loud at this one too. RIP.
joy|Sending you love ‚ù§Ô∏è
joy|Make a change make it small and manageable. Go for a walk. Smile at people.
surprise|Am I getting old or is that just really dumb?
neutral|She said in the ama she prefers they to he when out of drag but is ok with both
anger|I highly doubt they would do that in CA. That would put prices at 36$/pack and no one is going to pay 9$/pod.
anger|Fucking refs suck my balls.
sadness|Bump stocks too I guess, I can't imagine why he actually did that though, perhaps his advisors told him to do it to pander
joy|Lmao do you just watch for the gameplay? Wow idiot. There's more to Youtube than gameplay. F***. Off.
neutral|I just go over my FEASMs head for that.
joy|I like it
neutral|Just the CW thread, I don't think I've noticed bias outside of it.
anger|But then they couldn't be a self-martyring, violent tankie and that's not as much fun.
joy|if its not for [NAME] i will combust into flames and I will die
fear|Meh, it‚Äôs ‚Äúnext man up‚Äù over there. I‚Äôll be worried when they stop making it to the playoffs.
neutral|The only way to truly be yourself is to bare it all for the world to see.
neutral|Didn't like [NAME] and when he was here, hate him on the opposing team
sadness|That was the first thing we tried and we could not get it to work.
joy|Aw thanks for the hug, and yeah he did sound like a jerk.
joy|I definitely expected unwatchable pro-life drama and was quite delighted
joy|Thanks! Life often ends up being the most beautiful when you least expect it :)
neutral|> they look like such fucking OCs. [NAME] designed them I don't know what you expected. He phones in video games all the time.
joy|That's honestly what I thought too!!
disgust|What an obnoxious, drunk girl.
surprise|It wasn't an intelligent comment to begin with why would I take it seriously? Though I guess those 28 people did.
neutral|If your friend jumps off a cliff, will you let him die by himself, awkwardly? No, you take that jump.
neutral|Pm me the discord info
joy|Think its time you let your butterfly self out, dear....
joy|Haha, I wish, but not happening

neutral|Yeah that seems better if you know you are facing ToT

neutral|he had the shits
anger|Who da fuck wears swim trunks to a competition
fear|These are some of the lamest threatening letters I‚Äôve ever seen. She‚Äôs a metahuman who can you murder people with her voice.
sadness|Oh, I felt that despondency at the end there. Poor guy.
sadness|Glad you're rid of me? Pretty obviously breaking the sub rules there.
sadness|Due to work, gotta stay legal. Edibles aren‚Äôt legal yet sadly. Fortunately not taking it for cancer though, just pain.
surprise|What shouldn‚Äôt be lifetime? :)
neutral|Hot dog!
neutral|I feel like they could just be renamed by the stream + commentators. If the player refused to play then I think they just wouldn't play.
neutral|Elections have consequences.
anger|No that's your interpretation of the truth. A whore is an old and demeaning term for a professional sex worker. You just get off on being degrading to women.
joy|As someone who live less than a hour where she‚Äôs from, it‚Äôs definitely fabricated/exaggerated.
joy|This is such a cool idea. Basically an abathur that hats minions instead of heroes.
neutral|I always described it as, ‚Äúthe trashiest bar in Detroit‚Äù
sadness|Sold out. Sorry my dude!
joy|Yes of course and I catch a lot of it. I just didn‚Äôt realize this was about that!
surprise|Idk I felt like that until I got diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune disease.
joy|But the right to not have your property taken away from you is a right.
anger|I will never forgive and never forget for this one
joy|You‚Äôre dehydrated and exausted, drink lots of water and maybe get some sleep. You‚Äôll feel better eventually.
joy|For extra measure tape it right by your crotch so she can't take it for sexual assault reasons
anger|That‚Äôs bull crap call.
neutral|It makes me feel better about overeating sometimes because I tell myself that at least I‚Äôm not as bad as those people
joy|Haha oops **amiodarone. This is why we need safety checks for drug orders. ;)
joy|So, [NAME] was also paying to allow her to eat healthier. Let‚Äôs look at the bright side!
joy|Why do I seem to hit 6/7, and can't go any deeper without throwing up. I wanna see and feel more shit FML lol.
neutral|What will you do if you don't go?
neutral|Not a [NAME] fan myself, but there's no reason to comment on his weight or appearance. It only makes your side look bad.
neutral|Jokes on [NAME]. I only use Facebook to follow the defectives.
anger|He appeals to the conversation. Basically doesn‚Äôt have a firm stance on anything of much importance and will flip flop based on his guest.
anger|What an immature response. With a little passive agressive racism to boot. Classy.
sadness|Levels mate. Absolutely obsessed with our dominance.
joy|As a fellow artists and raised by an N I just want to say congrats.
joy|Literally awesome that someone else is doing the same thing! Funny thing is I go for two a year also. Heck yeah fellow dodger friend

neutral|wait for spring, you'll see what's the raging boner season
anger|Unless he has actually threatened to or used them against you I think you're over reacting. Ask him to please delete them.
surprise|How do you know if this gets downvoted to hell, but a lot of times before dying (6 hits taken.).
joy|Oh really. Go ahead and try to reason with an [RELIGION] government that their power should be limited. Good luck.
joy|You‚Äôll know it‚Äôs true love when he proposals you after 5 days.
sadness|Shame. CLG [NAME] could've been a thing.
joy|Yeah, you're getting points. Bring your insurance documents as well just to save yourself the trip back. They will ask for them.
neutral|Being bald makes you look younger than you are. Look at [NAME] and [NAME]! The are getting old and yet they look younger.
neutral|I‚Äôm going to be here instead of the chat room personally
sadness|This is so sad. #playdespacito
neutral|They probably make up 2/3rds of the income/salaries though.
joy|Thanks! Been clipping her for awhile now, I think I‚Äôm going to stick with her
joy|Without the stupid caption this is kinda funny
neutral|I don't think [NAME] gets enough hate for pushing that.
joy|You can talk to me. It'll be good having someone nice around.
fear|I know üò¢ it‚Äôs one of my life‚Äôs goals to see a moose in real life despite how terrified I will be lol!!
anger|There's no need for anger, but cringe and embarrassment are called for.
neutral|Ned Stark: Dead Stark
anger|we legally can't do that now mr. [NAME]
neutral|If you read my comment more carefully you‚Äôll see that this is not my idea of a free market.
neutral|"On top of that I just think [NAME] was saying ""I know how to evaluate talent."""
neutral|Sorry, not sorry'.
joy|Yes. One of her fingers is getting a sore on it and there‚Äôs concern it may push her into needing braces.
joy|I grew up there!! Moved away 20 years ago but still my home. Hope you're having fun .
joy|Sorry for your loss; this story is heartwarming.
anger|That's not really a solid method.
joy|Just hanging out at UQ St Lucia is pretty cool.

joy|Can't wait

neutral|What is the protocol for those seeking asylum? Do they get a fast-track to refugee status if their asylum is granted?
surprise|I‚Äôm actually suprised they all didn‚Äôt follow him and now they all have to repeat junior year.

joy|Joseph Vincent is the goat when it comes to highlights, I‚Äôm so happy he made a Saquads video
neutral|I mean, if the kid is 2, this guy could definitely be a gen [NAME] who grew up on smart phones
neutral|There's probably a YouTube video about how to do that....
joy|Hang in there, we're here for you. I hope you get through this.
neutral|here‚Äôs to the highlights when i was convinced that this was much more than just some some-night shit I know you don‚Äôt need me right now ***cries in Blonde***

neutral|[NAME] and [NAME] were amazingly cute when both were in their awkward phase where no one had the guts to step forward.
joy|i love this
anger|You're not, because I don't either. But I can still search Twitter. You know what else I found? Your evidence was deleted.

joy|Oh wow. Gotta visit it one day.
anger|No. No it isn't. Its a bad sitcom joke.
surprise|You think 60% is shafting anyone? I think Tellius is sub 20%.

neutral|I gave undeliverable perishables to a local fire department before
neutral|When she asks how he lost his arm she is looking up to him
neutral|Projection in the sense that they are projecting their infantilism and naivety.

joy|I'm not looking for pity or sorrow. Thanks for your input.
surprise|"Who are real ""[NAME]?"" Be specific which, denomination is the one true denomination?"
neutral|There are no victims of communism, only necessary and, dare I say, *willing* human sacrifices.
neutral|"That would be my next bumper sticker ""Proudly antisocial""."
neutral|i mean if you really want to play guitar with your thumb there‚Äôs nothing stopping you
neutral|BUT IT'S HER TURN! /s
joy|Fuck yeah dude. I need pizza now also. The beer and bourbon are flowing nicely. Cheers and happy New year

anger|Haven't noticed this comment before but, fcking [NAME], [NAME] really has become a household name hasn't she...?
anger|don‚Äôt you do it!!
joy|Thank you, I have received help already.
neutral|I've seen pigeons do this. I thought they were injured or dead until I checked.
joy|thank you for the laugh
joy|I mean, I know you are being sarcastic, but your words are too accurate for something a supporter would actually say
anger|Some people have thin skin and are unequipped with dealing with backlash.
joy|I think the dog is mostly worried about being fed and let outside when the last of the humans stop coming home.
neutral|Mediocrity? We were just in the nfc chamionship game. As far as NFL franchises go, the Vikings are far from mediocre
joy|Thanks for the info
fear|It‚Äôs the comment about smelling her that makes it pure cringe.
joy|This is the first time I'm seeing this. This definitely what I would call toxic masculinity.
joy|Thanks for looking out. Trying to keep expectations low but already have date two planned! Fingers crossed.
surprise|Do these Salinas officers not realize that no-shave November is over?
joy|[NAME] is POG indeed. I was kinda hoping to see him join Paris Academy team though.
joy|I'd love a 2D animated [NAME] trilogy. You can really go wild with animation and wild is exactly how I'd describe [NAME].
joy|I love how she literally held [NAME] back, a few times. They‚Äôre adorable.
joy|Thanks for the sharing your information.
joy|Please just give [NAME] some rest. He looks tired.
joy|Something tells me no!! Lol.

joy|Thank you for your concern fellow conservative
joy|Good god there‚Äôs so many cheapskates here trying to justify it by insulting me! Pretty funny tbh
neutral|The username oh god I'm having violent flashbacks
neutral|Ugh the amount of mismanaged shame, the Olympic level gymnastics to deny deny deny....it makes my eye twitch.
anger|Last time i knew stealing posts from other people wasnt a rule
neutral|No it‚Äôs not! It‚Äôs much easier to pull in to the space and leave it there.
joy|As someone who's been trying to break the bad eating habits, I feel you.
neutral|Brown woman bad

surprise|Oh wow okay, where can I get a wind proof lining beaning or scarf? And do I have to cover my eyes or anything?

joy|I feel you, mama. I hope tomorrow is a better day.
joy|Me too! They were half off at the grocery store and people love ‚Äòem.
neutral|I‚Äôm new here... do people like this actually sell their art for these prices? It only takes one sucker, but are there such suckers?
neutral|Its less than a year old... Doesnt it seem longer
sadness|Please don‚Äôt marry this man-child.
neutral|Wouldnt believe that much, surely rather stay and win the league first, cant blame him tbh
anger|Removed, stop trolling.

joy|Trolling cat lovers used to be funny, 24 years ago.
neutral|Just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in...
joy|Thanks for reminding me of her response video, that was gold
neutral|And if they can't find US suckers to give them cheap labor with desired skills, they'll simply replace you with an imported indentured laborer from India.
sadness|What country? That sounds like a sad septic system. I'm sorry.
joy|Thanks bot, I was and plan to have a great day despite this negativity in this comment section.
joy|Lol that‚Äôs great. Grew up in north jersey and had the opposite experience
anger|Horrible how they just invade your space anytime any place.
joy|This was actually a very interesting article. I'd never realised how Snapchat and its filters were driving people to be so unhappy with their appearance.
neutral|Divine ruler [NAME]
anger|Haven‚Äôt forgotten, but let‚Äôs get his ridiculous defense up to par.
neutral|There is no coming back from this. Move to Africa, never talk to your family or friends again. Also throw away your phone.
joy|Women aren't smart enough to see an intellectual kino du art like [NAME] multiple times
joy|Gotcha. I see my clarification above. I sincerely apologize that anything I wrote made you feel that you needed to enforce your boundaries.
neutral|Literally every man, hell every person, has things that weigh on them. One type of person gets a lot more positive support though.
surprise|I‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt name him Allesandrostien
sadness|. The only thing that matters is that [NAME] was murdered and those responsible must pay.
joy|I love how they added a camouflage hat on the australian dude for no reason at all
surprise|You mean you love their meat right? You dont love chickens.
joy|Clearly not or you wouldn't have fallen for Leftist propaganda.
joy|Imagine if [NAME] wins the power and uses it at the noms, not realizing [NAME] wasn't even planning on nominating her lol
neutral|Get himmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!
joy|Don't worry if you're from hot, we can share my slice (:
joy|Sometimes though, I wish I could be sad for a whole week; that would be a blessing.

joy|It will be painful but it will be worth it! Good Luck, and may you never be a slave to a drug again !
surprise|Guy on the right looks like [NAME] long lost sister
neutral|I was born in caul but my psychic powers haven't come in yet. :(
sadness|And the super rich are still miserable
neutral|It‚Äôs like. They didn‚Äôt even try to catch her lmao
anger|But I'm not happy
neutral|Pretty poor shots mostly. Couple of great saves from [NAME] though.
joy|Good job [NAME]!
neutral|22 but still no fucking excuse, he was a grown man who could make better decisions than that
joy|I'll have to start paying attention to the Diamondbacks now. Hope he does well out there!
neutral|Nah coal is pretty inert from an environmental standpoint. If the barge wasn't hauling oil, gasoline or chemicals there isn't much to impact the river.
surprise|That guy who melodramatically dances around playing horribly soppy poppy chord progressions over and over and does a cringy dance that makes me want to kill things?
surprise|"Why does your flair say ""Wasted Energy""? "
anger|Nah she's just a dull asari doctor, with a pleasing voice.

surprise|What exactly do you personally think that meme is saying, please point back to the meme for each argument you make.
joy|I'm sorry to hear that! But thank you for sharing I imagine several years of not seeing someone you care about would be draining!
joy|I don't believe it is. like other posters have said, you can do better. I know it's hard but you are strong.
neutral|Been practicing his slappers
joy|I think the hulk could do all of that at once, and fold the wrench with his finger tips
anger|Fuck [NAME] for blocking funding for this for years and years. So glad it's being used to help people now
neutral|Options: 1. Hoax / joke 2. Crackpot 3. Wellmeaning but utterly naive fool 4. Something more sinister I‚Äôm currently somewhere between 2 and 3.
anger|"Without Googling it? Are you kidding? (Please don't look up ""kidding"" in the dictionary.)"
neutral|Yeah, you‚Äôre just delusional. It‚Äôs ok to admit you‚Äôre wrong every now and then.
joy|Did you watch highlights of [NAME] vs [NAME]? [NAME] had amazing highlights but he isn‚Äôt the one competing for the Hart trophy now.
neutral|The irony is, she's probably been wishing for death for far longer.
neutral|I know exactly
neutral|Not just a faux pas, it's outright rude and inconsiderate.
joy|I love [NAME] but he seems to enjoy deleting his videos after a while :(
neutral|At that point you might as well pay a visit to his home instead of suing. His house is a google search away.
sadness|Oh man, I didn't expect that: It kept rolling on his face!
neutral|The name of the site in the title.
surprise|Miner rewards are being reduced from 3 to 2 ETH per block. Why would that indicate a sell off?
joy|I propose Istanbul. I don't think it's dull, I find it incredibly appropriate and amusing.
joy|Wildlife Ecology! Really gives you a better perspective on how natural systems work
joy|Good trade yesterday and happy with the front office, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand it‚Äôs gone
anger|No. That‚Äôs an actually pot plant. You have to do some extra work to keep it blooming each year.
joy|As the global wealth concentrates into fewer and fewer hands, I for one, welcome our neo-feudalist world order.
surprise|Holy shit this speaks to me.
joy|lol [NAME].
joy|Thanks for the share!
anger|He starts mildly enough with a pucker... then when she *backs away* he opens his mouth and goes further. Seriously - what kind of idiot is that guy?
joy|Theyre paid with taxes..... Do you think you're arguing against an anarchist? lol
joy|I think that making someone an approved submitter might get around that. Not 100% sure though.
joy|Oh [NAME] this is going to garner such hate hahaha
neutral|This screwball is an anti-semite [NAME] supporter, no point in engaging it.
neutral|"Simply wearing the MAGA hat is proof he's a racist little shit-lord and ""his side of the story"" was clearly written by a PR firm. "
neutral|"[NAME] should have done a diss song called ""Cammy"""
surprise|Oh dear [NAME]!
joy|Misread. I‚Äôm with you my dude.
anger|Trolls are not even trying anymore. Im offended by this half arsed attempt to get a rise out of me..
joy|This idea is brilliant.
joy|Well hes asking is it possible and the answer is that it is possible to be honest.
neutral|Not really. It's just that things you would do in Street Fighter to win are monumentally more difficult if you try to do them in MK.
joy|You win the Internet today. Fuck all the other winners. You‚Äôre the real one.
anger|This can be taken horribly out of context
joy|It‚Äôs nice to look at the comments and see other people who don‚Äôt like this.
joy|That's a good idea! Unfortunately don't have a vehicle big enough, so I'll have to hire someone with a truck.
surprise|I see two possibilities in the middle: Playing advocate, or playing devil.
anger|"I'm a bit late. What's the ""AAAAAH FUCKING WATER"" reference?"
neutral|It should be infinite since it was gonna link it but still chose to take around 155 hours to make.
neutral|There's the room for [NAME].
joy|Search your feelings, you know it to be true
joy|I have so much to think about
anger|Agreed. Everything she did was bad. She didn't anything good at all. Edit: Grammar.
neutral|Leave him alone!
joy|Damn that is impressive. Can we draft an entire o-line from them?
neutral|I'm convinced you're a fake account. You're too reasonable for /r/chicago ;)
joy|The books are pretty cool. They even get into the nerdier science side of being able to teleport.
anger|This person shouldn't be allowed to drive ever again.
anger|It‚Äôs because their pay sucks. You get what you pay for! Edit: grammar MoFo!
anger|Game day activities would be my guess. Not positive though.
neutral|My partner told them subtly no thank you. They won't let go.
surprise|I still can't believe [NAME] actually gonna be in Smash.
joy|"I always say ""Good Luck!"" ""Well Played"" after winning/losing match."
neutral|Could have cropped out whoever took the pic.
joy|Thanks! Very cool. It was a marriage gift, so that explains some of it. :)
joy|I love every bulge, scar, stretch mark and jiggle. Every single one tells a story I want to hear.
joy|damn, congratulation ü§£

sadness|It always upset me that [NAME] would require his only son to do this I no longer believe it
neutral|keep everything well hydrated
sadness|Can't. Prequel bad. Bearded [NAME] Man idea bad. OT era only good thing.
neutral|[NAME] has said he's giving it over to [NAME] for about 5 minutes now
surprise|I understand this keeps many dairies afloat (source neighbourhood dairy guy, so not 100 per cent sure it‚Äôs accurate).
joy|IMO, he was an asshat during the tell all, too. He was all about wanting [NAME] to thank and respect him post C section.
anger|Drugs are a hell of a drug...
neutral|I.e., you don't know what socialism is and what it strives for.
joy|Love you, [NAME]
neutral|"That is called ""delusions of reference"" and it is a symptom of acute psychosis. If he is doing any kind of recreational drug that will make it worse. "
neutral|They've usually had dementia for a good while before they become aggressive. I don't think you have anything to worry about for a long time.
neutral|muscle-y shirtless man in a kilt handling balls. guys like guys that can handle their balls and heavy loads.
anger|Don't go pushing your shame on others. I pull my weight my dude.
neutral|tHiS iS wHY TruMP wiLL wiN!!!!!1!1
neutral|I fully expect the curse to hit with him blowing out both acl's while playing video games
joy|Haha, willing to sacrifice eternal paradise for a taco. I'd make that trade, straight across..at least the taco is real ='D
joy|Thanks for not answering my question. :)
neutral|"Kinda off topic but is the ""More from this artist"" broken for anyone else? Usually it just shows the same album 3 times."
joy|"The only ""pro choice"" I like is pro choice of guns! Another LIBERAL trolled epic style"
disgust|He drinks all coffee with cream. We already know he‚Äôs not above disgusting liquids.
joy|Well done! That's usually the hardest part is to start going and I hope it helps!
joy|The right had both houses and the presidency and they wait until they lose the house to pretend they care about passing wall funding. So brave.
joy|Welcome back to H town!
sadness|Same thing happened (to a slightly lesser degree) with [NAME] last year and it made for a lot of heartbreak that some never quite got over.
surprise|So everyone‚Äôs cool with the corn rolling on the floor then? alright cool.
anger|Remember when the media ignored all of the horrible things [NAME] did? Including what he did to Syria?
sadness|ah dang sorry. in that case idk.

joy|This is my favorite picture in this sub
neutral|We may not have much connection playerwise anymore, but Flames will always be Mr. [NAME] special Western buddies.

sadness|I used to love watching movie reviews and video essays. But it‚Äôs seems like I can‚Äôt enjoy anything anymore
sadness|heh, I remember that commercial.. Was pretty cringy
joy|Love the beauty of nature.
surprise|In the era of [NAME], and to a lesser extent [NAME], I‚Äôm not sure this is a bad thing.
joy|no problem!!! :) have a great day, thanks for taking the time to comment
fear|This is extremely dangerous. And would completely marginalize anyone without a chip. Making it an absolute necessity for everyone to have a chip.
anger|Not sure if you're joking. Not sure if I disagree. But since the point of high school is daytime teenager containment google would not accomplish that.
surprise|Killing goblins is not murder hoboing. [NAME] should have done that himself, really.
disgust|Ha, I just saw that highlight. nasty
joy|The surprise would be that we just broke a 16 year old record...
joy|They actively supported it before *mysteriously* going silent about it during and after the 2015 Labour leadership election.

neutral|You don't get it, they mean *these* types of immigrants, not *those* types of immigrants
joy|>Ordinary Men by [NAME] Thanks for the recommendation. Got it ordered on kindle from Amazon.

joy|what a cute outfit omg
neutral|They'd probably need to take nutrients by IV until their organs are working normally again. But yes it should be possible to save a starving person
surprise|> Is it weird to have more sympathy for animals than humans? It's frighteningly common, so not *weird*, but it's definitely sad
joy|I hope you aren‚Äôt saying that there is no co-relation between imperialism/colonialism and standards of living in the West, in this case Britain.
surprise|Wow what a surprise...
neutral|I can‚Äôt help but think it‚Äôs BS because he found the girl 30minutes ago and his first reaction is to post to reddit about it.
joy|lol back in the day before the rise of BitTorrent, Russian ISPs used to run DC (DirectConnect) hubs

joy|Good luck.

neutral|Or, you can just accept that extremists didn't reason their way into extremism and you can't reason them out of it.
surprise|Oh no now I'm caught in the suspense, what could have happened?
anger|that's not split pushing. split pushing is literally pushing 2 lanes at once.
joy|That‚Äôs what I was thinking too but I didn‚Äôt want to just assume lol.

neutral|I have never laugh cried so hard at a TV moment
anger|Also assumes a kid only has one teacher K-12 at school. Which is ridiculous.
sadness|sorry it was absolutely not like that
joy|You didn‚Äôt change my mind, but that‚Äôs actually a very interesting thought ‚Äúthe Skywalkers are the imbalance‚Äù.
anger|Well then I feel sorry for men for being such incontrolable sexual beasts I guess. My original answer was sincere, I can't speak for others though.
disgust|tobaccy is nasty
surprise|Is that because it's an accurate description of the politician and he's trying to distract from his guilt?

neutral|When the guy is polite enough to signal his cutting you off.
sadness|you're going to relapse in two years because you have an illness that makes you use excessive amounts of things to cope with emotions..
anger|What‚Äôs irritates me so much is that rework ideas like this do all the work for ubi, yet they still won‚Äôt do it.
joy|first time all season im kind of not thrilled with [NAME] post game talk. I wish he would have addressed the PP.
anger|Not an effective solution. Shooter always has first move, taking out an unsuspecting teacher would give a shooter access to better arms.
anger|None of these people ever seem to have run their own business.

sadness|I don't just cringe, I feel literal embarrassment for anyone who has watched it.
sadness|We are usually way worse in the 3rd tbf
neutral|We talk about PizzaGate too Why doesn't CNN cover Israeli interference in US elections? CNN seems to be aiding and abetting Israel in their meddling in US politics
joy|Thank you, it's pretty helpful.
joy|soon i‚Äôll have an army of karens and no one will be able to stop me
neutral|A lot of LGBT people I know just love D&D. Especially since character creation is just everything they want about self-expression and then some.
joy|I love the fact nobody talks about boycotting the Times (owned by the same media group), because they know scousers don't read it anyway. üòÇ
disgust|To be fair, it is worse than staying in the EU, but good grief it's better than a no deal.
neutral|Well AB definitely isn't the norm, but if you're gonna have burgers and fries why not have something better

anger|He was forced into this marriage
neutral|Not to mention even if it was called and due, the WBC have said they would be happy with a unification first.

neutral|Y'all really out here supporting authoritarian Venezuelan dictators huh.

surprise|Was it just me or when they showed the backboard camera did the hoop look like it had a surprised face?
neutral|Do you spend the majority of your time scouring shite newspaper articles?
joy|Awesome, it looks like we've found our next scapegoat.
neutral|Refusing to acknowledge the *'First Act of Supremacy (1534)'* was a reason too.

sadness|But he was so *hurt* when [NAME] acknowledged that homosexuality is a sin.

anger|This why we can‚Äôt have nice things! I would‚Äôve beat him up for taking with my non-existent mans away üò§
surprise|OP and wife probably have other areas that are private. Sometimes it could be our dreams that even we don't dare speak aloud to ourselves.
anger|> I'll only debate subjects I'm knowledgable of. Then you're not good at debating.
joy|Hey, your hair looks great! As a fellow curly girl I'm just wondering what your routine looks like?
joy|Your brother is in a freak cult that ruins lives. Forgive him but don‚Äôt listen to that bs.
joy|Well, yeah. She wasn't the best actress up for the award by a long shot. I don't think this is a surprise to anyone.

surprise|Did you guys use condoms before? Or was it just the mental hurdle of knowing you weren't taking any birth control?
neutral|And it's posts like this why HotS is in the position it is. Blind to any form of criticism.
surprise|Honestly after he was so reasonable and calm throughout this confrontation, the hatchet man tattoo made me chuckle. Definitely unexpected.

surprise|Are you not the copycat, for being the thousandth person to do this?

joy|Your right. I just didn't want to go into depth out of laziness

neutral|I don't think abortion is murder, but it's factually way less easy to disprove than the earth being flat.
anger|Yep happening to me all the time at my college. Fuck everything
joy|I LOVE your glasses! I have the same color but a slightly different shape but yours really suit your face! Also I'm jealous of your hair ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
neutral|Yes. So instead of getting a decent meal catered, he goes to the cheapest places possible.
neutral|He also does not care much for his mother because she knew Dr. [NAME] was lying. Just your typical leftist bully who hates his family.
surprise|Oh my god, zero-calorie Gatorade is a thing ^(i don't care how many chemicals are in it if its zero-calorie)
joy|Thank you, I love Heart and Zeppelin and haven't seen that till now.
disgust|Everybody betrayed [NAME] [NAME]. I'm fed up with this world.
anger|Avoid Blount St and Martin Luthur King or risk death. I‚Äôm not kidding.
neutral|I bet they're the kind of teacher that says something totally wrong and then power trips when one of the kids calls them out.
joy|Loved this book
joy|I really wanted him to be wearing cowboy boots, but will still upvote for those rain boots!
joy|Good minutes from bayless
joy|Yeah it is getting strange. I've even been talking to a right wing poster for the last few days who is terrified of her.
joy|Im fine with complaining. A little surprised he's complaining without playing or even reading the patch notes since they were released.
neutral|Go Leafs Go
joy|This is amazing and exactly how I feel about him. I love [NAME] and [NAME] but this is why Nuge is my favourite NUGE IS HUUUUUUUGE
neutral|Passed a CR England driver last week who had his phone mounted in the middle of his windshield with video playing. Blatant retardism
joy|now when I'm off work I completely forget it exists, I love it
joy|My day was ok, I‚Äôve just been watching YouTube and on twitter.
anger|I don't know about that. Old Liz managed to earn around $90k over the past couple of years.
anger|Removed? Damn no respect.
neutral|Idk if I skimmed over it 3 times or what, it doesn't say why he did it. But I guess we'll never know?
joy|Yes, we did.
joy|Luckily I never got sucked into Overwatch, because I know if I had I would definitely have an unhealthy amount of playtime racked up.
joy|So glad for him, he's such a good man and deserves everything good
neutral|Satire? He asked hopefully, yet with deep pessimism in his heart.
neutral|No. [NAME] is the clear #1. But [NAME] could go first round
joy|This is funny, although... Some people just can't take a yolk.
joy|congrats, [NAME]. you played yourself
joy|Makes me want to break out my 'learn to use my SLR properly' resolution again.. more time commitment tbh. Great shot.
joy|When the player is reasonable with his demands and the team is reasonable with their offer, magic stuff can happen.
joy|I love this trend.
joy|Thank you for the clarification.
joy|We are like the douchebusters!
surprise|Wow, really? I hope this kind of event doesn‚Äôt happen that often.
joy|Problem is we don't have much else of value. [NAME], [NAME], [NAME]. We have to hope [NAME] likes THJ.
neutral|People with the power to enact laws to stop an issue, complain about the issue - More at 10
joy|I'm crying. Their faces üòÇü§£üòÇ
neutral|trust me, that's an unnecessary edge in this league. Also, it's not like the projections on Yahoo are much better for most players.
neutral|Shadowbanning me isn‚Äôt good policy either
neutral|Not sure if [NAME] or [NAME]
joy|Agreed, but I can't believe the bottom of the barrel just has double French doors opening into the foyer of yet another barrel.
anger|Bulls medical staff misdiagnosing again, what else is new
joy|> but [NAME] shut her up see this is why we love [NAME] so much
joy|Doesn't matter if we stop, everyone else will do it. You're telling a whole world looks don't matter, yah good luck.
anger|This isnt a excuse. It affected their start last yr also.
neutral|Tonight's attempt at installing gib on ceiling ended with me in tears, damaged gib and still 2/3 of the ceiling left to go. FML.
surprise|Did the goat enjoy it?
neutral|He‚Äôs doing this to get some of that lawsuit money
neutral|I like it when a sub's name matches what I say when I see its content.
joy|It's mostly what kids are enjoying at the time. I know I associate Minecraft with my little brother would watch cringey Minecraft YouTube videos all day
fear|That [NAME] missed layup is haunting me right now.
anger|He has become that which he swore to destroy!
neutral|It is physically impossible for [NAME] to get bad skins.
neutral|Bagel Bites?! Blashphemous! Pizza rolls or die. (All joking aside, welcome! And Bagel Bites are freaking delicious)
anger|Not this sub‚Äôs fault the ((([NAME]))) is full of idiots
sadness|A bad pun can be a real pick-me-up
joy|EXACTLY. Not only is it incredibly important, but it's incredibly **fun** as well.

joy|I love it that they're filming this with a phone or something
joy|"""average good singer"" "
neutral|[NAME] was struggling against the taller Sixer's guards, got swatted on a lot of drives too even with [NAME] out with injury.
neutral|I won‚Äôt but if I tell him to have a threesome didn‚Äôt I open the door for him to cheat
joy|Most likely it‚Äôs not a tumour since cancerous tumours aren‚Äôt usually painful. You still should go check it out ASAP.
neutral|T-shirt and basketball shorts
neutral|Her body, her space. If she was uncomfortable, then he should be respecting her.
joy|I was jumping the same gun but decided to do some googling just in case. Glad I did :)
joy|[NAME] is lining up for West Ham, holy shit im excited to see this play out
joy|A volley into a header. Just wow. The skills.

joy|"""here's where the map completely breaks"" ""also centurion has safe heavies"" like really lmao"
joy|I can't unsee it now. I wish I could, I love magic
neutral|They react bad because they've been indoctrinated to see capitalism as the only way that works. Even if they're social democrats.
anger|yeah violence shouldn't be your goto first option, but the people who pretend words are meaningless sounds are stupid idiots
joy|At least we've always got other people here who understand.
joy|Noted thank you.
joy|"They didn't have a ""bullpen"" when they won the WS or when they went to the ALCS last year. They will get by as always"
anger|It‚Äôs insane how [NAME] hasn‚Äôt been carded yet
anger|‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need no more sisters, I got enough last year‚Äù *cut to shocked mid drag faces in the werk room*
sadness|Apologies, sir
neutral|Right, seafoam. High of 16c today! There are always nudists at the beach, it seems. Not many, but a few hardy ones!
joy|I love tropical weather, it's the endless ocean and moving ship (I have bad vertigo).
anger|No wonder crime is going up if these morons are in charge.
joy|That one little girl with her jersey, nearly jumping out of her own skin to get a high 5 is adorable.
anger|¬£20 per child?! That is ridiculous! You can‚Äôt buy much of anything for that! I am furious on your behalf!!
joy|Me too thanks!
neutral|Gross. She did is so cruel ever. Document this report to cops against her.. And Disown/cut cruel family is best gift.
joy|That's awesome man. Keep it up bro. Glad to see there's some people out there that still care about others
neutral|*fingers in ears* LALALALALA EVERYTHING'S FINE. Check out [NAME] twitter feed for similar attacks. r/Alberta is definitely slightly left, but distrust of [NAME] is spreading.
surprise|That's still a fucking insane number. 70% is goddamn insanity, and the only reason you're alright with it is because you're unaffected.
neutral|Baths, especially after the gym. Fresh flowers in the apt. Emotions are pretty cool too.
joy|LMAO me too! Just give us the life sentence and be done with it ü§£
neutral|Toy department hype! So hard to keep from using caps!
neutral|She's as tall here, in giant heels, as [NAME] is without shoes so I'm betting on not tall.
surprise|You called [NAME] a defensive player of interest. I don't know that logic is in this topic.
surprise|I think this guy might be a [NAME]. It's hard to tell these days.
surprise|In this regard, how are babies different from neighbors?
neutral|Cars- with my dad
joy|Red Line guys are awesome. The Chicago office is going to be infinitely better than te New York one. So much for ditching the whole city thing.
joy|great ideas!
neutral|I think you and I think alike. Sometimes I wish I knew less of history... because ignorance can be blissful
anger|Don't bother, redditors hate Israel
neutral|Oh [NAME].
joy|Neither are sleeping adults, so it's ok to kill someone as long as they are asleep.
surprise|Yup, my greatest fear realized.
joy|Blade and Soul looks terrible, IMO. Way way way too much saturation and bloom. Great post, OP!
neutral|#SHOCKEEEEEEEEEEEER!
anger|I was already taking a break from basketball this season, but I think this really put the final nail in the coffin. This team is hopeless.
neutral|Next level up to termination.
joy|Ok that makes sense. Im familiar with the term.dog whistling, just havent seen ot attached to globalists.
neutral|Too much time am running for it
sadness|Sorry, but isn't this a little too obvious? As the old saying, the early bird catches the worm.
sadness|Didn't expect him to land back in the championship, although mears was much more unlikely
neutral|Uh, she was [NAME] girlfriend. She broke up with him with that text.
neutral|Because [NAME] is a free agent after this season so he could just leave when this season is basically a lost cause for us
joy|Go slowly and don‚Äôt pressure yourself but rake advantage of some adult company for an evening out if the opportunity presents itself. Best wishes
anger|[NAME] is just another millionaire taking advantage of dumb people.
joy|YES please! I would love to see this map back in game! So many good memories
sadness|What a cringeworthy load of kak this is. Wow I have no words.

joy|He's hilarious

neutral|keep spinning that hamster wheel
neutral|Oh... I read that the fedora made her sweaty... I can't imagine head wear making someone moist. But hey, there's something for everyone.
joy|this is magnificent
neutral|I've always thought it was weird that they keep their hard drive on the left.
sadness|Running a company will be the same disappointment. Your problem is unsolved.
joy|You really went in to detail, and with valid points. Œî
sadness|"Also, on my phone this didn't show up as a ""cross post"". Sorry!"
anger|How the fuck is that not ticketable.
joy|Did anyone see the ladies sitting behind the Hawks' bench?? WOW, like smoking hot.
neutral|because the cops dont have the manpower to chase after every schmuck who orders small amounts...
joy|The most important part of a sacrifice is the innocence of the victim. (Even we [NAME] belive that). The unborn are the most innocent.
neutral|‚ÄúYour friends dead because [NAME] has armor.....and a big fuckin sword!‚Äù
neutral|[NAME] and [NAME] at crunch time. I must be dreaming!
neutral|He‚Äôs close. Flip [NAME] to fish for [NAME] Then go out and get [NAME]
neutral|[NAME] was pulling a knife on [NAME].
surprise|Isn't it the same thing? Or at least equally bad?
joy|Same. Even while not on my period I have lower back pain

joy|Yes you can start working. Just use those bags, but don't bother with the prompt on the dashboard.
neutral|He really likes racism
joy|No, absolutely not. How bout if you have more to lose you be more careful about not breaking the law.
sadness|It ruined me, too. D:
joy|Beautiful Work! You take doing [NAME] work quite literally:)
neutral|10,000th franchise win (against Boston) was cool, also 2017 ALDS game 4 (my only playoff game ever)
neutral|Those are still huge numbers for a guy that can‚Äôt even take a free throw without double clutching his shot.
joy|Awesome!!!
sadness|The woman types like she isn‚Äôt a native speaker of English. Which worries me immensely.
joy|I mean, OP is consenting and asking for it, it's better to let them be
neutral|Even he's tired of marriage.
neutral|Honestly, these are probably things you should have thought about before telling your husband you wanted to separate.
neutral|But they're this close to breaking new evidence of Russian interference!
joy|I feel retarded because i laughed
neutral|As a teacher it would be lovely to eat lunch in this room instead of where i do. GTAGE
joy|I enjoy it as well, there's dozens of us!
neutral|Yeah maybe but when you are like 'cool, no worries' and actually mean it your chances with another girl dramatically increase.
sadness|I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you but it‚Äôs I can imagine I know if it was me I would forever feel Guilt.
anger|**Zigzagzigal-type Balance Suggeestions** - I feel like you are flying, why not get into a war with China who, because they had no alternatives.
joy|I‚Äôm just not sure why he thought I‚Äôd find it attractive, it deserves an attaboy at best
neutral|Bullying impacts brain
anger|Thanks for saying that, but yeah: you really need to do something about your boy there. He‚Äôs not right.
surprise|Where is this video on Doesn't seem to be on any of the pages I loaded.
joy|Poor [NAME]. Give him some Enfamil. He will feel better soon.
anger|That was brutal.
joy|while her other suitor looks like a decent guy, looks good, trying to be a good bf.
neutral|Speak for yourself. Our defense crumbled under incompetency despite the talent they had to work with.
joy|"""YOU BUNCHA BASTARDS"" is one of my favorite quotes hahaha"
surprise|Glad you had fun!! Did you all, ya'know? Did you all make plans to see each other again soon?
joy|That looks like a fun group
joy|damn i‚Äôd love a transboy to be my prince charming
anger|Nah, according to OPs limited post history, he's a pedophile.
fear|It‚Äôs horrible for me, way worse than your situation. Be Glad that you aren‚Äôt me
joy|Thank you. For some reason I thought it had been released in all markets.
sadness|Why is [NAME] still getting minutes? He is probably the worst player on this roster.
joy|This made me laugh.
joy|Even after the initial testing? Thank you!
neutral|They're both made by [NAME], and they're both hilarious.
neutral|Lmao the UBI is just the powers that be making sure they don't have a revolt on their hands once their program of economic alienation reaches a head.
neutral|Mine would have bought it to me.. then turned away when i went to retrieve the ring *NO TAKE!.. ONLY THROW!*
joy|ok thanks alot :), just extremely weird VAC bans are less harsh than throwing for Skins. lol
surprise|"would I be correct to refer to this as ""pop feminism?"" I think we're talking about the same thing when I say that."
surprise|You're a bit of a wet wipe aren't you?
anger|Tbh I don‚Äôt hate either sport I just find them both silly. Especially soccer when Players fall intentionally to pretend to be hurt
neutral|If you read sub rules, you would know you can't post here.
neutral|She births the antichrist and has to fend of the demons trying to abduct her baby
joy|Great anime though. [NAME] awesome.
joy|Lets see if [NAME] cares about playing hard in [NAME] return to LA. I think we can win if our players actually play hard and care.
joy|Hers are just terrible. I‚Äôve seen the look great on other people.
neutral|Manipulation of a persons enviorment while denying they are doing it in order to make the victim appear crazy.
neutral|SHE is a MA‚ÄôAM. and yes very
joy|:) this made me smile. I laughed so hard at the blinker fluid part. You and [NAME] are proof that not all heroes wear capes.
joy|Makes sense, but I imagine if they wanted the land that badly theyd just buy it off him
joy|Just eat it after. Lol. Im kidding, but it would honestly be the best recycling option. Not that anyone is going to do it.
joy|I‚Äôm glad I had a few margaritas before I read this
joy|I'm a sexworker and trust me, plenty of us love our jobs an our work.
surprise|are you fcking serious sis
anger|Beat me to it. Just because the news makes it seem like there is a pandemic of school shootings, it is exceedingly unlikely to happen.
neutral|So [NAME] is still on the block and hoping [NAME] can nominate someone else.
fear|Snorting them might be what kept her from having a lethal overdose, snorting benzos is pretty much a waste as most of it barely absorbs.
joy|For fun!

neutral|"There's a crocodile who's not hungry. Pissed off but not hungry. ""Get the f--- off me!"""

anger|I'm not to proud of them right now. I'm mad at them ‚òπ‚òπ But big ups!!
joy|Wow. My first comment here (I think) is met with hate! Ouch!
joy|Someone being kinda mad is undoubtedly better than someone having their tongue ripped out
anger|No, they don‚Äôt. No morning after pills/contraception pills are free, even at the clinics
neutral|why does he look like [NAME]
joy|Yeah but everyone dies so that makes no sense lol.

joy|I can help.
surprise|So THATS how he got the room for that backhanded top 10 nhl goal...

neutral|whyyyyy !!!! ughhh
joy|Glad you are resting better, and as for your friend he deserves the brownie points.
joy|If we were in the same city we could've hung out. Happy new year to you. You're not alone in being alone.

neutral|Can't believe the IDF official account posted a doctored image clearly knocked up on paint in 30 seconds
surprise|Ok what other characters is her gameplay similar to?
joy|And I also appreciate you.
neutral|Even without the age thing, going after a coworker over a crush has a 9 out of 10 chances to end badly.
neutral|ESPN said [NAME] doesn't deserve to because he should have the Pistons playing better and shouldn't be on the outside looking into the playoffs right now

surprise|Why do all the animals look terrifying oh god oh fuck
neutral|If you think steamed hams is unexpected anywhere on Reddit, then I got news for you

neutral|I'm going to try and have this mindset ... I wanna eat slower
joy|Yes that would've been so much fun! You can only imagine my shock and disappointment...
joy|These folks have surpassed
sadness|Sadly they aren't in control. [NAME] is and he'll always do the worst possible thing.

anger|Oh look, it's wr2! *proceeds to get fucked*
neutral|Welp, the GOP's removing their last appeal for me.

neutral|Two recent
neutral|This dude is acting like python is hard smh
joy|Ok maybe I should watch Tangled

anger|You're pushing me to adopting irrational and nonsensical beliefs! dogs are cats now!
joy|Lilo and Stitch is one of my favorites. I really want to go buy a stuffed Stitch to hug now.

joy|Thanks, it was no effort at all.
neutral|Looks like your hormones are not working properly.

joy|Thank you, really. I always thought so, but it‚Äôs nice when other people see it too.
neutral|Leave [NAME] or [NAME], only one of em.. replace one with maybe [NAME]
joy|Be safe.
joy|Oh great now Soda is screaming again just what I needed.

joy|Amazing notes. Posts like this is what make us feel that we are not alone in our struggles.
joy|Oh thanks I didn‚Äôt pay really attention haha

anger|Nope I‚Äôm not exposing my kinks to Reddit üòÇ
joy|Amazing, my friend üôè
joy|You have the bear mask?? :D it is glorious!
joy|it‚Äôs a sensitive topic and she probably took it as if smelling bad lol. i‚Äôd just avoid saying that
neutral|I think the best way to think of the age is that [NAME] is 17, [NAME] is 19 and [NAME] is 20.
neutral|I'd prefer it that way than the alternative reality in which [NAME] knows where I live.

joy|Wow good on you! I hope to have similar progress this year. How‚Äôd you do it?
anger|Look! More complaining about people complaining, thus compounding the issue! What a happy little circle-jerk : ) You guys will never stop.
neutral|Medical interventions that are undertaken to save the life of the mother, even if the result is the death of the fetus, are morally permissible.

anger|Women can't do wrong you fucking mansplainer
anger|Ahh damn! Gotta pay attention to that, never even knew!
surprise|Get the app - has your combat record and recent match stats..don‚Äôt understand the problem.
sadness|Somebody should make this a smaller video to share it around, this poor kid is going through a lot.
joy|My favourite book, the writing is beautiful. Very much a precursor to 1984.
surprise|> I don‚Äôt understand the boot-licking mentality Calling it in 5 years. That's your future AP.
joy|Meanwhile Monokuma: Everything is free if you just become the blackened and get away with it
joy|Lol what are you smoking
neutral|The dude with the eyepatch is fitting.
joy|Ahh didn‚Äôt know that. Thanks!
neutral|I only know of [NAME], but she's said there are others.
joy|This is so good!!

fear|It was a few years ago now, I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt have it or I would.
neutral|[NAME] ONLY WANTS STUPID VERONICAS AND STACIES AND NOT US, GAYS RISE UP

joy|Hot dang, this almost makes me want to go to the dentist.
neutral|I feel like they would look at one of the Spurs assistant coaches if they were to part ways with [NAME]. That or maybe [NAME]
anger|Well that's an awful superpower to have. Maybe you could fix [NAME] tho.
joy|My first thought was how bloody your hands are when your downed, You turned Blood and Gore off. Good man
joy|Great, now I look dumber than I normally am
neutral|Don't forget the price increase. They made sure to keep that promise.
joy|Then he should have had his head up. This is hockey, not figure skating. Great hit! I miss that kind of contact in the game.
sadness|no do not destroy [NAME] pope and glorius god emperor will cry :((((
joy|They were really supportive!
anger|I feel so stupid. I‚Äôve never made the connection between [NAME] refusing to play for SD and [NAME]
neutral|"Not making many new NYC fans: ""I'd rather live in Auschwitz than NYC""!"
anger|He's not a believer, so he doesn't see what he did as wrong.
joy|Starting field position does not affect dvoa
neutral|u/RedOnTheRail you slime!
joy|Which totally makes it less funny for a person like me who has never seen this before, and laughed.
anger|Sharing with 3 other people was the worst part of hospital for me, fine in the daytime but at night I was barely able to sleep.
joy|That's great to hear. I hope you get it, and have many years with that job.
neutral|The fact that this dude spent a good hard several working hours to get fake internet points from strangers tho
joy|One of my favourite [NAME] moments
joy|thanks for sharing.

anger|‚ÄúTouch me again and I‚Äôll kill you.‚Äù I‚Äôm low key blown away that The Last Boy Scout even *made* it to Australia.
joy|‚ÄúBahahaha‚Äù Isn‚Äôt that a quote from the Raving Rabbids?

neutral|oos? im new lmao my rep is only 32
joy|I'm glad none of you are GM
neutral|The timing of the run
neutral|Do not diddle kids
sadness|**Lost** children. Issues we face today are likely fabricated from the bottom up.
joy|I was trying to think of a better player to pick on..... couldn't lol
anger|1 5v5 goal in 2 months is not good anyway you spin it. But pleasure being downvoted by you, enjoy believing in WAR
joy|How did I not know this?! That show is so good.
surprise|If that's true OP, you've lived quite a sheltered existence.
surprise|Wow. I didn‚Äôt realize a simple medical term like obesity judged a person‚Äôs laziness and intelligence. üôÑ
sadness|This is a bad post and you should feel bad for being the author
anger|His video is definitely against the rules.. He literally asks people to spam oh yeah yeah everywhere
joy|Please go to youtube and leave a comment and share :) Happy new year!!!
neutral|The healing feels intermittent. I accomplish and then relapse to why did I stay. Why did I even say yes when it was always there...
neutral|That is hot af dude!
surprise|[NAME] isn‚Äôt a rocket scientist. I was surprised about the Thailand thing tbh I did expect it to be true haha.
neutral|Then they will complain about it being cold in the winter.
neutral|Here you go. Just search your username for the respective platform.
neutral|It doesn‚Äôt look like the opening is wide enough unless you turn the plate sideways. Crazy way to present food
joy|Lol i highly doubt it. A third grader did that photoshop job
neutral|I have a coworker that had a similar problem... turns out she needed surgery to clear out her sinuses. Once she had the surgery things improved significantly.
neutral|Sounds like a man child, why don't he get it.
joy|She is smiling in the picture and, to add insult to injury, seems pregnant in the video....
joy|Yay! Mine‚Äôs Cymbalta and Lamictal with a dash of Ativan lol
joy|Not all men harass women, but enough of them are that all women have *been* harassed by men.
anger|PUT THEIR BLINDFOLDS BACK ON!!!
anger|This does not sound like a good situation for a child at all imo.

anger|Trust me no one getting caught but this dumb MF
neutral|They keep thinking #ThotAudit is going to take off. üòÇ
joy|Had to ask a co-worker from Beijing, she confirmed.
joy|I guess. I'm going to try getting in better shape, and just socialize more.
joy|I'm gonna say break it off and expect them to date at some point. So prepare for that one. Sorry bud, good luck!
surprise|Yeah, at this point I just keep of off anything remotely related to what Im playing/reading, its just too easy with the internet these days too be spoiled
surprise|This must be what blasphemy laws felt like in the Middle Ages.
joy|I appreciate it!
sadness|Suffering from success...
neutral|It shouldn't surprise you, since you're here.
neutral|Okay this meme is getting old now.
neutral|Puts me to sleep. If I want to watch a bunch of dummies be dysfunctional and commit crimes I'll watch Always Sunny.
joy|A little weird but I guess it's wholesome.
anger|As per, they‚Äôre being slammed on social media. Their response and justification of it being from seven years ago is contrary and lame.
anger|Of course. Just know that I know that you know you're a liar.
joy|That was informative. Thank you.
anger|[NAME] playing sloppy
joy|That's really good!
neutral|The current way Boba works doesn't warrant his removal enough. [NAME] isn't technically broken, the way the target system works is.
neutral|Someone else suggested netrunner which is a card game like MtG.
neutral|Probably it is a lot less memorable for those rich guys since they eat this type of stuff so often it stops being a special experience altogether.
anger|Calm down. What the hell. I just tryed to tell you that there MEIGHT be a different side to that story.
fear|Report her to the police. Physical threats are a no-no.
joy|This is so scary but true
fear|Honestly scared to see what happens
anger|So wrong. Most every denomination believes they are the only ones who are doing it right and everyone else is going to rot in hell.
joy|Lol. Ill try but its just not fun anymore. Haven't dashed in 2 weeks. Busy day job now so no extra time for shenanigans
joy|I guess I am totally alone but I am really enjoying the audiobook and haven‚Äôt had a single complaint. I‚Äôm half way through now
joy|lmao it's true. I'm cracking up about it.
joy|U guys are super cute together.
neutral|Just show her highlight videos on YouTube from the past 2 seasons.
joy|I mean, that‚Äôs great, but would you start dating someone you didn‚Äôt think was attractive initially?
joy|I believe furloughed feds still have health insurance benefits so you're not wrong on that PSA.
sadness|My grandmother-in-law does this. I‚Äôm sorry to anyone in the Va Beach area.
joy|I love the north east. Can‚Äôt say much for the rest though
neutral|come back!
joy|Outstandingly well done.
joy|Then we shall duel for it. *Good Fight!*
neutral|He called [NAME] to the Steelers and was outspoken with how good the Juju pick was.
neutral|Cheers, i was out of date. Things change fast!
anger|holy mother of oof
joy|I‚Äôm just in awe because this will actually get so many people up in arms.
anger|I would gleefully look forward to a battle where fascist apologists and race baiters utterly destroy each other. Maybe then we can have a civil, unified society.
neutral|I'm so so so sorry this happened to you friend. I hope [NAME] had a lovely life üíó
neutral|Family first, this ain't no stranger trying to profit. This is blood.
sadness|if it wasn't him it would be someone else she's wasting her life on
anger|She looks so corrupt... Same with [NAME]
sadness|That poor snek :‚Äô(
neutral|So wtf can I do then ? All the killers I was good with I suck with now and ruin is cleansed way too damn fast anymore .
neutral|Oh they should also mount a shelfie stick on the pike wall to capture all the action!
joy|If that's ice cream, then honestly I eat ice cream from a cup at home. It's great for portion control.
neutral|what are the actual odds of getting #1 pick? anyone know?
joy|If they had tried to free their friends first, their bomb would have been confiscated so I say they made the right choice.
joy|Hey, that's awesome. I'll be sure to think of some questions for you in the future.
anger|Nope. This guy is legitimately this dumb.
joy|Always and I appreciate your opinion good sir
joy|Will do! Thanks!
joy|I love how there isn't a single legit trade in this thread
surprise|It‚Äôs [NAME]?!
joy|Thanks! I was actually considering that myself, but I'm scared that I'll just start rambling about it
anger|I hate the argument too. It betrays and exposes the violent, primitive ape amygdala response that is most Human social interaction.
fear|I'm scared because we don't really have any isolation scorers right now.
joy|Wow excellent shot
neutral|I feel the same
joy|Well yeah! Doesn't everyone? I'm in the one about ED. I guess I'm a natural deflator. ü§∑

joy|I used to fantasize about my morning oatmeal. One packet of instant oatmeal. [NAME] dreamed about it.
anger|exactly how i feel about it too. the guy is just a jerk, and can't be bothered to care unless it benefits him. selfish little prick
neutral|It‚Äôs a way of recognizing someone‚Äôs comment/post. It‚Äôs basically a thing that you buy for someone to help support reddit.
joy|"Not one single figure anywhere to be seen. Reminds me of auld Soviet propaganda. ""The harvest is up"" ""People happier than ever"""
anger|Tbh I've never found the porn ads arousing, I've usually found them annoying, stupid, really clickbaity, or hilariously cheesy
surprise|Is it that common? Here on the tube on London there is barely room to breathe let alone spin so I guess we avoid this kind of crap
surprise|I'm from the UK, I thought you must have been joking. Queen were the height of cool at several points in their career.
anger|You guys are heartless, smfh.
surprise|I don't remember accurately but something in the lines of >and slightly leaning back so as to not be able to reach the remote
neutral|It is January after all. The yard in my house is looking horrific right now - I haven't been out in 4 months!
surprise|Isn't this from [NAME]?
joy|Haha gutted.
disgust|It was a bad one, and you should feel bad.
neutral|Be true to yourself. Your the only one who will be
neutral|no matter what he says, this man is not a [NAME].
neutral|Cut contact... End the friendship.... Get on tinder and find a new woman to date....
joy|love love love this. so happy for the both of you.
neutral|Total temple tourism. I have seen 3 friends on Facebook announce that they're going to Italy so they can attend.
surprise|It is designed that way, but curiously, some of the color options are not worn
joy|I love our cheese curds both fresh and deep fried. So good. And now I'm hungry.
joy|Love frank and moody together
joy|I know this is late, but I can‚Äôt believe I missed this. Love it.
joy|I had that moment of ‚Äúwait, am I the narcissist‚Äù too! Thankfully, like you said, time & distance cleared that up.
anger|Boooo!!
joy|Keeping [NAME] was a great decision. What are you even talking about!?
joy|As a [NAME] this makes me proud.
surprise|Like ConfusedYehud, I'm also curious why there is a difference between a woman's face in a newspaper and a woman's face in the street.
joy|No way! I never would have made that connection lol
joy|Lmao this dude sitting in an Iowa thread throwing shade on New Years Day with nothing better to do.
joy|So PST it is. Glad we agree.
neutral|"Promise me that when you call out his name you pronounce ""Papa-paparazzi papa-paparazzi pahhh pahhh paparazzi, dinnnner!"""
neutral|[NAME] save us
surprise|"I was going to say ""too lazy to go down to the basement to do it"" but then I realized this isn't the north."
neutral|That can be true...
surprise|Same cfn as reddit tag? I'm curious to see this.
surprise|Any proof for your statement regarding [NAME] being a PKK cadre?
surprise|It's the physical pain, mostly, I think. Maybe with cbd stuff getting big and easy to get now it'll taper down?
joy|this is my new favourite thread
surprise|Is the fruit named after the colour, though, or is the colour named after the fruit?
fear|this off season is dark and full of terrors
joy|I would love you forever! Or dare I say, love you long time!
neutral|OMG If you like weed with dust, hairs, & whatnots...
neutral|The fact that people are still governed by tribal taboos from 2,500 years ago is insane.
joy|that's an adventure!
sadness|I can hardly hear you over those goal posts moving! Ahhhh the facts! They hurt! They hurt so bad mama!
surprise|Ooooh wow. üòÜ
neutral|Tell that to korea
joy|The comments in there are so nonchalant I can‚Äôt help but laugh
neutral|Na I see [NAME] doing a [NAME] in his fight vs [NAME]. Goes all out rage mode and big [NAME] cleanly knocks him oot.
anger|No. You have to have killed her due to negligence or the like. Manslaughter is essentially the crime of accidentally killing someone because you did something careless.
joy|INTJ here, I agree with this ^^^ (Him)
neutral|You can get blood from a tissue that's 3 weeks old to plant!
surprise|It'd be easier not to do it at all. I don't think it's meant to be easy.
disgust|Praise [NAME] your taste is bad /s
joy|I want to give you reddit gold but I‚Äôm poor and bad at money spending so have my love instead
sadness|[NAME] i feel personally attacked
joy|Just watched The Pass on Netflix--really great movie, but not exactly a feel-good time...
neutral|I highly doubt they will do another multiclass character after what [NAME] did to the game.
joy|Ok man. Glad yo know you are aware of all financial situations.
neutral|I meant after he first suspected the incest and told [NAME]. He went to Dragonstone as he was afraid he would be killed.
sadness|Unfortunately I‚Äôm not a military man
surprise|I'd be shocked if he knew much of anything about the EU.
anger|People are legitimately monsters.
neutral|It is the internet. It's the place these guys call home.
joy|i would just like you to know that even though that dipshit didnt read what you wrote, i did, and i appreciate it. very good post.
neutral|Locked it in chastity
neutral|Maybe she misheard thirteen as thirty. It's a possibility.
surprise|You mean Ichigo/Nero/Black Ranger/I'm a Frog. Did not know that [NAME] voiced [NAME], but it does exsplain why he sounded so familiar.
sadness|Poor crack baby üò•
anger|Not this time
neutral|They were bad times.
anger|Don't like having different stripe profiles on the shoulders to the front of the shirt. One or the other.
joy|I bet your all of the rage at parties
neutral|Because everything is like a video game to them. And in real life the PvP is unbalanced!
joy|Cheers to a better 2019 for our boys!! Can‚Äôt be much worse then 2018
joy|I am now sad the latest Thief was so mediocre, because the actual City the game took place in was a great little world.
surprise|I'm not surprised at all considering, you know, buzzfeed
joy|Well, if 10% of active gun owners each convert 4 people, we win :-).
joy|I got matched with the best [NAME] in the world today, it was well fun. Felt happy to win a round ahaha.
sadness|Sorry I am foreign, and might have come across wrong. Anyways it has to happen at some stage?
joy|you obviously dont know how the wilpons work lol
joy|Don't hesitate to do it.
neutral|Whatever keeps your inflated ego going strong, Captain.
surprise|I'm quite curious as to how recreational marijuana legalization will effect these rates. The first two factors are generally caused by alternatives of sorts to marijuana.
fear|This looks like don't hug me I'm scared
neutral|It‚Äôs treason then.
joy|It‚Äôs $7 is what it is. Which thrills me
joy|Nice! I'm glad there was a great turnout. Congrats!
neutral|What is your final solution for Snowflakes?
joy|Adulterers are not known to be kind and rationale during a divorce. OP should protect herself.
joy|Ice at the office sounds like such a luxury to me! I wish!
joy|I also love the first sentence (but in a more pro-science way than was probably intended)
joy|Okay. I‚Äôm not a [NAME], but I love block games? Idk
neutral|It's not even that... just string in the water.
joy|Good night, sweet prince. I hope it was a quick one.
joy|Good luck!
joy|Hope you‚Äôre ok mate!
joy|I like [NAME], just thought there was significant savings there, and maybe sign [NAME] for cheaper...idk
surprise|I find this extremely hard to believe. Living abroad is hard, and most people can hardly fathom leaving the USA, let alone living outside it.
joy|Haha! I realized that after your comment. Definitely not trying to walk in Loubs with a peg leg LOL
joy|I appreciate that you care about me. I've been thinking about you as well.

joy|Happy New Year to all my fellow Asuka mains and all you dirty bastards who show no hespect. Cheers!
joy|So obvious you got downvoted 40 times, ok!

anger|I don‚Äôt CARE!
neutral|Sounds like he wants to strongly pretend he's not paying for sex.
surprise|YeH, I‚Äôm trying to inquire about this.
neutral|THAT FEELING WHEN YOU DISCOVER THE GOP CAN'T MEME
surprise|I'm after interesting things to read (like science, tech, psychology and etc.). So what's my place?
anger|Lol no.
joy|Hope [NAME] is ok to play but if he needs to rest that hand then that's what he should do...
neutral|The counter-clockwise was a bit too much for even a real anti vaxxer tho.
joy|Haha I can imagine! Good on you for doing it though.
neutral|I stopped reading in the first paragraph where they try to make Vanderpump Rules and Desperate Housewives legit shows.
surprise|He's mainly on Twitch now. Before I unfollowed him some time ago he did some YT content from time to time.

neutral|deleted ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.5933 ^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?
surprise|Have you ever tried to give her lessons in cooking? It could be fun and a bonding for you both.
joy|Hey friendo nothing down here but there are ALL SORTS of interesting smells!
joy|Thank you [NAME]. Best of luck. I'll always remember your goal to clinch MLS Cup 2017.
neutral|Blind kid throes better first pitch than [NAME]
joy|Looks nice but will wait for a PVE dedicated map as that‚Äôs more my jam.
surprise|I forgot about that. üòÇ
joy|Leave it alone hopefully it won't pop overnight
joy|You're right, that's a solid advice. I will give it some time and if I am unhappy I will start distancing myself. Thanks!
joy|I've never seen anyone do it successfully on a car, but I'll concede that it could definitely be possible.
joy|I gotta try that with my posse next time I‚Äôm on. That‚Äôs hilarious
neutral|‚ÄúWhat about people who mow down pedestrians in the streets‚Äù Key word THEIR OWN BODIES. An unborn child is a child a separate being.
surprise|did he give up out of embarrassment having knocked back chicago for us and then not getting to join us.
joy|Ughh same. Love the finish of it just wish it had more coverage.
joy|Heavens to [NAME], guys, thank you so much for the gold! That was super-unexpected, but what a delightful thing to wake up to! :-D
joy|He looks like the demon all the other demons beat up for lunch money
sadness|There are too many factors at play to really say that. It's still probably disappointing.
joy|The most sense the internet has produced in a long time. [NAME] bless this dude.
anger|That‚Äôs not true at all. I play on xbox and you can‚Äôt Loot teammates you or any squad mates kill.

joy|Welcome to the gloaming. Yes.
neutral|"*anti-racist. ""Racist"" is just another slur for 'white', like 'cracker' . Trying to make it work in any other way rings hollow."
neutral|Didn't you get the PM? Post to /r/CatsWithJobs instead. Edit: It's already been posted there actually.
neutral|some men sit to pee. men also get attacked and feel vulnerable in certain areas. the more you know.

neutral|I think that in return they should sign [NAME] to a long term, cap friendly deal and send him back to us
joy|If I may suggest patience, if your data is still there, you might want to read a little before open heart surgery.
anger|Close the door, you're letting the heat out!

neutral|She looks like an onion
joy|Happy Anniversary!
surprise|Seems like you took a hard side in the previous 3 comments. Hypocrite much?

joy|I liked the comeback tho
anger|Nah, I knock on the door from inside, or the wall, or tap the floor, seems easier
surprise|Did anyone else notice [NAME]' face twitching a little?
neutral|I daydream about putting them on. I let other people daydream about the taking them off part.

joy|I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. Either way. Lol
neutral|[NAME] injury, [NAME] coming back, leivo trade. Quite a few moving pieces

surprise|When did we get rid of uprights? He was amazing for us?
joy|I love you.

neutral|Also [NAME] was Canadian and Canada = hockey which is likely why you made the mix up.
neutral|Just admit you got busted and admit you were wrong and we can move on
neutral|So basically nowhere near the consensus required for a united Ireland. If a no-deal Brexit happens we can see.
joy|I love this pic... believe me I am up for some reason my hands on you.
surprise|Does taking a small jab at [NAME] shrek 2 mean something has to be wrong with me? What a fragile world you must live in...
anger|"[NAME], I've told you already. ""Muy gorda chica"" does not mean ""very pretty girl"" "
surprise|[NAME] fucking christ. When [NAME] came into the league he was pretty much as skinny as [NAME] is now. And look at the dude now.

fear|Just the name of it gives me anxiety
anger|I just never felt like a boy. I hate my body and I just feel like I can't express myself for who I am.
disgust|That's awful. If I were a celebrity, I would probably do the same.
anger|Well, I probably would have been against the Cespedes signing if we had to sign him for 7 years. But that goes more for a pitcher.

neutral|I just popped a pill in my chAmpagne, she say she love me she don't even know my reAl name' -[NAME]
joy|Happy birthday!

joy|This guy gets it...
joy|I did. In a selfless sacrifice that I hope brings ample awards.
joy|I absolutely love it that EVERYONE is scoring... please keep this up for the rest of the season.
anger|I‚Äôm not going to live in the middle of nowhere. I like Chicago.

sadness|It's a last resort when I forget my iPod, I swear
neutral|>ffs just admit that you're unable to continue and offer/accept terms. As in I am [NAME]? As in I am [NAME]?
joy|Thank [NAME].
joy|I completely agree with mondawggg. Playing the petty way instead of discussing the issue with him directly is so much more productive....wait
surprise|"""We must fight!....to run away.."""
neutral|i mean it can if its a meritocracy and an uncorrupted government. Whereas in modern America theres a shit ton of nepotism and a corrupt state/federal government
surprise|That‚Äôs a new level of blonde I never knew existed!
anger|I honestly do not know. Chastise them for their hardness of heart and presumptiveness I suppose. I guess that is what [NAME] would do.
joy|Oh hahaha, is it a reputable vendor?
joy|That Man has one of the coolest tattoos on his knee I've ever seen.
joy|Usually it's not entertainment, it's mostly curiosity and fascination. Like when you see something horrible, but can't turn your eyes away.

surprise|Do you want to be promoted to Secreatary of State for the US?
neutral|Always have a Stockholm syndrome induced craving for HSE standard jelly and ice cream anytime I think of hospitals here

joy|I was very tunnel visioned at first haha didn‚Äôt even notice the arm
sadness|I had 175/1 back in March. About to go to Vegas again and it will be disappointing to only get 12/1 this time.
neutral|Because it would be beneficial to her cause if he were. [NAME] scapegoat mechanism in action.
neutral|would it be like Caspian‚Äôs bombs where you have to directly be hit by it?
neutral|many men should die trying to save her from having to confront her family.
joy|look at more of [NAME] work, he really makes the picture come to life.
joy|That.. would be glorious. A large one of these would be the NZ equivalent of Giga Pudding.
neutral|I think it‚Äôs because his contract hasn‚Äôt been finalized yet. Could be wrong, but saw a tweet about it today.
joy|That's interesting! Here I am having been saying I grew up near the original all my life. I will correct my story.
neutral|Guess there is no benefit for my next car to be any safer considering I haven‚Äôt died in my old one then...
neutral|But he did...at the end of last year and this season.... And I‚Äôll take Mayfields word over speculation
sadness|We had a baby, it's hard to find the time to take them down.

joy|Couldnt they just play music through a speaker? This is hilarious
anger|It‚Äôs an imperfect poll demographic group skewing erroneously towards a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. [NAME] was incredible this week.

surprise|How are you punishing him for sneaking food? Why isn't that working? What alternatives have you considered to get him under control?
surprise|Yeah I doubt the woman would post about it whilst still in his bed. She'd wait until she was dumped then complain about it at least.
fear|I'm sorry you had a bad experience, that's horrible. But that number saved one of my friends lives. Different for everyone
neutral|I love all Radiohead since The Bends, but I think I prefer Kid A and In Rainbows to OK Computer.

anger|Keep dreaming. He isn't coming to this black hole of an organization.
sadness|I feel sorry for her son that must have been super cringe

joy|[NAME]. Please, [NAME].

sadness|Oh sorry. Instead of ‚Äúwillfully stupid ‚Äú I meant, why do you hate America?
neutral|I‚Äôm aware but you won‚Äôt see the Turkish state broadcaster promoting that filth.
neutral|You should tell the FBI and Mueller investigation that. Also [NAME], since he clearly didn't get the memo.

disgust|I hate these cakes so much.
joy|I'm thankful every day I was in school before the Internet, smart phones and social media.
neutral|beat kenpom #11 on the road without [NAME] or [NAME]. [NAME] big ten player of the year and [NAME] is a dynamite defender

joy|A drummer's MC is the best MC
sadness|That's why imo [NAME] death is better.
anger|You know, I didn‚Äôt have an anxiety attack all day. Thanks for ensuring it happened.
neutral|Also what a waste of resources. Teach them something actually real and useful, not made up nonsense.
neutral|I assume he likes it and wants to share what he loves.
joy|Sure, but it's been all over the news recently with the [NAME] doc that just came out. I've seen tons of posts here on reddit.
sadness|I feel that nobody cares and nothing will be different because this is a total non issue for vast majority of people.
joy|If your partner is so consumed by his addiction that he chose it over you, you know what to do.

joy|Not sure about [NAME], but I think [NAME] would win easily against [NAME]
joy|Ok guys I'll watch it. When I finish it I'll tell y'all what I think

joy|"Hopefully he gets what he is looking for. Not sure why some people are getting pissy over this. ""How dare he look out for himself, REEEEEE!"" "
surprise|Yeah i also like [NAME] now but that gives me a horrible idea. What if we think the same about fortnite later

joy|Me too. One of my favorite potential Dem candidates
joy|"""Someone else must start this however... but I will sure join in the violent fight that will ensue... I promise!"""

surprise|It's as though it all melts away the moment you realize it's not true.
joy|"I heard it to the beat ""I want you to want me"" I like your squanch!"
sadness|I'm so sorry for your loss. One of my favourite unisex names is [NAME].

neutral|These are the only causes that are remotely stomachable for me.
joy|We made a big raft of inflatables on Little Bay and listened to the Hottest 100. Good times. The water is finally nice and warm.
neutral|You sound like you have a warped view of what makes someone strong and an overblown, distorted sense of your own masculinity.

sadness|Ya it‚Äôs Bamas league to lose every year
surprise|[NAME] went form 4-12 to 11-5 when he switched teams. Coaching success does not necessarily regress with age. Athletic ability does. That's the difference.

joy|That's a cool dino
joy|I have a college-level understanding of biology, as it is my degree of choice. Those 8th-graders are completely right.
sadness|Some seriously embarrassingly bad fan fiction too
neutral|True on the colder end, but their summers are not as hot because the humidity is low so it really cools off in the evenings.
joy|I'd steal that!... just as cool.
joy|Well then town is flummery for not guilty'ing the mafia lol
neutral|Yeah is saw that. Poor [NAME] :D
joy|I grew up SDA as well. That probably explains my disdain for religion in general.

neutral|Keep in mind that being frugal is the best place to learn about all of that.
anger|I really hope that's true and really hope they grow some balls and ban it.
anger|There's doing stupid things when you're young. Then there's doing horribly stupid things when you're in your mid-30s and you're already active in Politics
joy|On being 3x over the speed limit while under the influence, that alone makes him very guilty of something wrong. Thanks for the additional information.
neutral|There was a thread about a month ago:
surprise|Can‚Äôt wait for CBC, the news needs to know about what‚Äôs going on
neutral|So you made this purposely to get post karma...
neutral|Pro-tip: the Press misleads you about what is wrong in the world.
neutral|You do not get my math? Because my comment and your comment are saying the same thing; women over 45 probably do not want bio kids.

anger|So now disabled people don‚Äôt have rights . You get worse .
joy|Research #42 and also learn about our [NAME] Father, [NAME]. Get ready for a great year ahead.
joy|Downtown is inconvenient, look like you've gone full county, enjoy your strip mall

joy|Even when it's bad, it's still pretty good
joy|This is my favorite reddit conversation I‚Äôve seen in a while
neutral|To calm him down I suppose.
joy|Oh definitely, there was reports of [NAME] and his supporters using Spam to spread misinformation throughout the entire campaign.
neutral|Not to nitpick, but wasn't [NAME] (I assume that's what they mean by [NAME], but people are weird) [RELIGION]?
anger|It is. I bet chantex and all the other 'quit smoking' companies hope this book doesn't become too popular. That would cut into their profits.
joy|Sorry I kind of took it like you were flexing on my or my opponents skill or something lmao
joy|Even though I didn't know you personally, but I just want to say that I am proud of you. This is an inspiration.

joy|Added you mate well I‚Äôve just got the bow and I love the hunting aspect of the game so happily join you hunting and what not
surprise|Always thought that was funny but is it a reference to anything?
anger|What are you talking about? Anything bad that happened was [NAME] fault - only good things were [NAME] doing!
joy|More like a baptism, with sexy results!
joy|Enjoy the ride!
