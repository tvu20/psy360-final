joy|Arizona in the summer is fine. Arizona in the winter when all the blue hair snowbirds come is absolutely horrifying.
joy|Last year was Celtics and Sixers... that‚Äôs pretty decent
joy|Yeah, [NAME] stans cannot get enough of it. In their little bubble [NAME] can outsmart a queen with experience in dealing with petty people.

anger|Yea can get a pic of me and my mates when we go out for drinks next So don't bother trying with jokes? Just keep it empty?
neutral|Keep asking. Mine turned around eventually.

joy|It‚Äôs always entertaining watching people in the background semi-dance, while being painfully aware that they‚Äôre on camera

joy|Didn't read all of it, read the relevant articles (165 for license simultaneity, and 56 for carryover sanctions) haha
joy|Really hope the best for him. Couldn‚Äôt stay here but hoping he keeps that girl far away from him and gets it together.
neutral|Thought this was about signing brown. Op is an attention whore
neutral|"Especially after the debacle with [NAME] on ""if you like your plan, you can keep your plan."""
neutral|...and prone to paranoia and hatred of outsiders.
neutral|Just gotta day that age gap might have something to do with this. I bet he hates that dang rap music too.
surprise|Isn't this the same video already posted ? Not seeing anything different
joy|Nukeville sounds like a nicer neighborhood. Like no broken and burnt houses and like children playing in the street and people having barbecues
neutral|What a god
neutral|Probably wouldn't hurt to delete this post and pretend it never was posted.
neutral|I'd rather [NAME] take the fight at this point, [NAME] looks ready to red mist
neutral|Delete your account.
joy|No haha but this is our first day on Reddit!
neutral|Didn't he write a dissertation about the pros and cons of finishing college instead of going into MLB?
surprise|I would love to know why you think it's awful advice!
joy|Thanks! Tbh I just set the limit from true to false, didn't want to mess anything up by changing it. What number what you recommend?
neutral|Maybe it depends on the state. In California, that means you‚Äôre a moderate [NAME].
joy|Okay will try to contact the restaurant owner/manager
joy|There have been some really good replies in this thread, I hope they help you too! :)
joy|Congratulations! One day you‚Äôll look back on this and laugh. It‚Äôs the best thing you‚Äôve ever done.
neutral|It is now the *most* open bottle
anger|Me thinks you‚Äôre responding to the wrong dude. My original comment couldn‚Äôt have beeen more drenched in irony.
joy|Oh gosh, I can‚Äôt wait to see how much you‚Äôve accomplished Mr. Not Retarded Criminal
anger|I like simplicity of the Jersey, but the logo stinks.
joy|Thanks man, I will have to check it out!
sadness|Really sad how often people don't go into the closest lane first and then change lanes when safe to do so.
joy|I was thinking the same thing as well. Glad to know I'm on the right page.
anger|What the fuck? Why would you ever say that? Downvoting you smfh edit
joy|This jokes a name changer
anger|Nah, man. Check out Provo, Utah's old
surprise|I dont even know what that is lmao
joy|I did love seeing [NAME] and [NAME] guest on the last episode of the Orville.

joy|Good news everyone!
joy|Hell yeah o/

joy|Yup, not anymore. Keep your blood sugar up! It really helps and DRINK water...
joy|Thank you for that. I just want to feel safe secure and loved just once.
neutral|You're not going to get anywhere with these kids, mate. Reddit is being astroturfed.
joy|Love this game, can't stand the combat system. It's just not for me.
joy|It was actually pretty great, definitely going to return next week! :)

joy|Good luck to you darling. I hope you feel strength and happiness.
neutral|It looks like someone else was deleted for answering, so I'm hesitant to now.
joy|I wish the 'opt out of redesign' button actually worked :(
disgust|I kinda like the swirlies in the hair. But then I saw that her eyebrow is actually just the hair and hated it.
joy|Thank you so much. Fur babies are one of a kind.
joy|Lovely experience on the trains this morning lool getting me practiced for being in a coffin
joy|I encourage everyone close to me to inform themselves about my diagnosis if they really care about me.
joy|oohh, that makes a lot more sense now, thank you kindly
neutral|The one who accidently paid 1 cent less couldn't have just given the other dumb bitch a penny? smdh
joy|Hey it's really green here right now thanks to the last few rainy months!
neutral|This is what happens when you don‚Äôt beat up the nerd enough
joy|‚ÄúOur decaf is like really good tho gurl, you‚Äôll be okay‚Äù
neutral|Man if you want some crazy dreams, slap on a few nicotine patches before bed.
joy|Haha. Dried fruit is partially how I got fat again.
joy|Good for you
joy|good luck with the interview!
surprise|So you're saying there's a chance I'm a bot... I don't even know what's real anymore!
anger|Facts have no relevence here, you cannot use them.
surprise|>I was internally startled but tried to play it cool. Why?
neutral|cultural norms is an interesting way of classifying the sort of people I see doing ~100% of littering in NYC.
joy|If you're not helpless so be super easy to fix.
neutral|Meh, the Chiefs got gifted a PI call or two, especially on their last drive to tie the game.
joy|Great thanks for the advice!
joy|I'm always down for pimple popping pupper pictures!
sadness|My favourite pool! Shame I don't live around there anymore
anger|I was too legit. Too legit to quit. Now I‚Äôm not legit. I‚Äôm un-legit. And therefore, I must quit.
surprise|WHAT A TWIST!!
neutral|The way his head snapped up, it looks like she caught him on the chin. That would also explain why he got knocked out.
neutral|So does [NAME], so much for him being a Thibs guy.
joy|Vapenorth.ca is a great place to order the Dyna from.
joy|So cool! So bonkers that people do this, I love it! Do you mind if I post these on my pages?
joy|Him staying seems more realistic. I just hope we can land him.
neutral|That‚Äôs kind of the point of comment sections.
surprise|This is surprising as many pizza places us peanut oil on the crust in the past. Had a friend end up in the hospital from this.
anger|"Dear [NAME] man! (Irony intended) You didn't say ""proof"" you said ""evidence""!"
joy|Thank you very much.
neutral|Old man yells at cloud
joy|Thank you, that means a lot.
joy|"""I have to deal with this, so now you have to also."" "
neutral|Making you sign a refusal of service waiver is scared of liability. Charging you for it is shady.
neutral|Orange man = bad
neutral|And [NAME] is the opposite.
neutral|Depends on the state, generally speaking.
neutral|I feel like this list is way off base from what we've been hearing.
anger|It's super annoying. There is a reason I no longer speak to this person.
sadness|Tried so hard and got so far, in the end it doesnt even matter
joy|[NAME] Need people to play with so thanks :)
joy|Both. lol
surprise|"It's almost like they actually prepared to govern instead of just obstruct. Remember ""Repeal **and replace**""?"
neutral|Just heard the Xbox Rare Achievement sound go off in my head.
joy|Hope this scenario changes for the better. Else non affiliated scholars might overtake the academia in ushering real breakthroughs that would change the game.
joy|Yeah, it'll be a pretty strong 3 team race among the Nats Braves & Phillies! It'll be fun to watch it from afar!
joy|One day please show this post to him it is so beautiful and kind.
fear|She‚Äôs horrible
surprise|It surprises me Turkey doesn't intervene even there. I would presume that at least OB-ES areas are off limits and Turkey would intervene if HTS entered them.
anger|Unless he was lying about his age, no.
joy|Sure but Ireland chose to join the EEC, that was and is a policy decision.
neutral|r/btc is the only place in the world who thinks like that while the rest of the world thinks Bcash is a shitcoin nobody uses.
joy|Cool. Glad I'm not the only one who found it weird.
neutral|[NAME] as [NAME]: Be 1% Less Worse
joy|Yeah that‚Äôs what I heard on Univision deportes earlier. I hope he chooses Ajax rather than real Betis
neutral|"But little did I know, she found out about ""[NAME]"" texts"
sadness|Sorry, I don't get it. ELI5 please.
anger|Nonsense. People are either the best or the worst. All of the time.
surprise|I was also terribly confused. I‚Äôll jump on and play with you sometime, working tonight unfortunately.
joy|Hahaha. Oh [NAME]. Way to ruin the fun lol
neutral|Well, yes and no.
neutral|They did and he is going to be extremely difficult to feel much empathy for him.

neutral|At least you should have helped out since you had rudely interrupted him.
neutral|No passes on skin color or class, yeah right thats why [NAME] is a supreme court justice right ???

joy|I agree with the last statement but apparently I'm also bad at matching pokemon to rep :(
anger|Yeah, this seems weird to me, too.
surprise|You don't have a point. Yes there are aspects of crypto that is confusing. Getting confused between buying BTC or BCH is not one of them.
joy|Make sure to tell her /r/Austin helped you pick a place! She'll appreciate the thought you put into choosing a place special to her.
joy|Friends for eternity! Loyalty, honesty!
anger|YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I SACRIFICED?

neutral|"He's gonna say ""stop eating chips"""
joy|I'll dance with you.
joy|There's ignite on the lane too, that's an upkeep kill on censor. I agree that horn into coup could have been a better play though.
neutral|Check out [NAME], he's like the [NAME] of dissosiatives.
neutral|[NAME] are proof of this.
neutral|Unfortunate for him, but I'm bringing up players. >AND they can just stop being a support.
joy|There is so much positive support and affirmation in this thread and I love it. Congratulations OP.
sadness|Sorry, I meant C
anger|[NAME] dead and it was the Government that killed him.
neutral|Do you have a link? I never saw the video, I only heard about it
joy|seriously... if he was going to play in LA he wouldn't do it with a 2 hour commute lol. he would just buy a mansion in LA
joy|r/ThirdSentenceHappy My eyes swelled with tears as I opened the door and watched all 8 puppies, overcome with joy, as they were reunited with their Mother.
neutral|I suspect there's a difference between people who have an interest in makeup and those that don't on this.
anger|I wake up as a girl everyday. A girl with a penis, huge hands, hair like fucking everywhere, no tiddy, and an unwelcome boner.
joy|It would actually make me more comfortable if someone did that to me
surprise|What was that?!
surprise|Are we talking about [NAME] or [NAME]?
joy|Never thought about it but it‚Äôs bloody obvious when pointed out! Good tip
anger|nope, this is just older people not understanding how teens actually communicate
joy|Btw I‚Äôm totally including myself in the karmahungry section but that pic was just too appropriate to not share
anger|Because they want to. Why do you act like a goddamn weirdo about stuff like this?
joy|Actually looks really fucking fun. Where can I do this?
neutral|What an incel
joy|Good luck with it all. I hope she recovers. Keep me updated if you remember haha
anger|It's been over a decade since consoles decided to mandate wireless controllers and I'm still annoyed by it.
anger|It's disturbing that you even have to ask that.
joy|Going to bed early never works for me. Sleeping in is the only way I feel rested.
neutral|The Pants by [NAME]. Give it a listen. Lol
neutral|There is this story of a woman who got pregnant from anal due to some rare condition:
sadness|"If people think that the current migrant/refugee crisis is ""bad"", they have seen nothing."
joy|I've agreed with this since day one. Check out his match he he had with [NAME] back in NXT
joy|He didn't blow anything. She blew it with him. What a fun guy!
anger|if it shatters your little ego i'm fine with this. :)
joy|Mind if I use your allegory in my classes? It's perfect.
anger|I'm guessing [NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME] needs to remove that stick up her ass.
anger|All they see is EA bad, this whole sub is coming full circle jerk now.
neutral|[NAME]. I still want her to come back to be a [NAME] ally and fight with [NAME].
joy|OK, I'll be glad to help you with your trip!
joy|Sad but true.
joy|Happy new year!
joy|Hot bath helps me, or just heating pad on my breasts. Looks awkward, but it helps.
joy|37 and together 12 years. 11 yo kiddo. Thanks for the tip. You're right.
surprise|I'll add to this: be prepared to not get closure or questions answered. This is the hardest lesson I had with my break up.
joy|He's not wrong though.
surprise|When I was maybe 8 I discovered that I liked hot dog buns with just ketchup. I shortly discovered what heartburn was.
joy|Thank you, agreed.
neutral|Oh it is, it's just that you know that thing...about the intel

neutral|[NAME] is a nut; he has a rubber butt!
disgust|i find it a little disgusting if swear words are used frequently and unironically.
sadness|You're saying it's depressing to see someone eating whilst other people are starving.
fear|Matinee games always scare me, but I have confidence in this team. LGI!
joy|So no resignation or impeachment. Bummer. Naive me had high hopes the great [NAME] wouldn't escape the noose this time.
neutral|Educate yourself instead of defining yourself.
joy|Very insightful and tragic post, OP. Thank you for sharing and raising awareness as someone who has been through the trenches.
joy|I love how they all state the stupidity in the quote and the person saying it, with only a few realizing it's something [NAME] said.
anger|Like many TIFU posts, I don't believe this one.
joy|Not related to any of this but I love your tag next to your username xD

joy|Tbh the floor is probably more comfortable than the seats. Doesn't make it safe though.
joy|This is a great photoshop! On a related note... retire [NAME] Number and Maybe [NAME] number..... oh and also fire Garpax
joy|I think I could watch an entire show with just these two all the time.
neutral|They're basically our version of [NAME] and [NAME] at this point. Every video seems to involve a dumbass rant that misses the point of the topic.
fear|As a strip club connoisseur, this is one of my biggest fears.
joy|I‚Äôve actually been there lol
neutral|You're way too involved in this. Take a break from the internet.
joy|My guess is that we will get it done at $9.1 for 8 years. Slightly high number now that will seem like a bargain in 4-5 years.
anger|No it doesn't work like that you're wrong
joy|Nor am I as his servant. Though seeing him happy is awesome!
joy|"Going through a divorce right now. Her saying ""I love you and maybe we should go to counseling"" would make me more than happy."
neutral|I haven't killed one yet, but I did kill someone that had a carcass. I think I got $3 at the butcher.
sadness|I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss and even more sorry about your mothers shitty reaction. I hope you‚Äôre doing better. ‚ù§Ô∏è
fear|malicious intentions? what are you talking about?
surprise|I can't believe he got it while getting man-handled by two players!!
neutral|ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN!
sadness|Hm so sad. Am I supposed to feel bad for you because you don't look like [NAME] phelps? Btw, he's on steroids no doubt
neutral|Margin of error: 0.7%
joy|Let me admit. This show is a guilty pleasure. Seeing these people's lives in such chaos brings me joy.
anger|Destroyed healthcare you mean? We have to pass it to know what‚Äôs in it. ü§£ what a dumbass.
neutral|If they overdo it and burn themself out it may be.
anger|If this was some weird publicity stunt to announce the [NAME] is coming back I will die. In reality, it makes me think he's coming back
neutral|As far as I know, the last necromancer you kill is guaranteed to drop a lantern.
anger|Pretty frustrating that when it matters most winning comes down to who cheats the most aggressively
neutral|She might die before then, risky move either way.
anger|Those eyebrows are faker than my future
neutral|Epiploic Appendagitis. Although it‚Äôs almost certain that you‚Äôll have to affirm that you aren‚Äôt talking about appendicitis.
joy|I'm beginning to think that ArcSys might be my favorite videogame company. They make such good fighting games.
sadness|Oh sh*t guys I got banned
joy|One day you should go get that donut! Personally, life wouldn‚Äôt be worth living if I couldn‚Äôt occasionally enjoy a gourmet donut üç©

neutral|>!the only time it's become a harem is in the epilogue, and it's only 1 part of him!<
surprise|The math so far appears to indicate something more damning. The question I'm curious about is whether the information will come out before summer.

joy|Great mate good luck!
joy|Yes!! There are some great step parents on the show!!

neutral|I'm not surprised.
anger|Taliban is the worst.
anger|If you're in the Arrowverse, stay away from [NAME] and [NAME]. Swipe motherfucking **left**.

neutral|Poetic justice they get to the title game host Philly and BDN whips it out for them and shoves it down their throat. That would be epic.

neutral|He does hate [NAME] though. And [NAME] gets promoted.
sadness|Im 13 I can't get a job..
neutral|Hmmm.. This map]( a lot like this map
anger|You armchair analysed it, and were entirely wrong. Literally none of what you said was true, because it was all pretend.
joy|üëç <3<3 so much yes! üî•
anger|Yeah it's unexpected but I have to remove this because it's not satire or gatekeeping.
neutral|But she still looking like late twenties
joy|Thanks for the love bro
anger|Hey, you can make baseless claims if you want. Don‚Äôt expect people to just believe you though.
anger|"Oh btw this was me yesterday, commenting on that ""ugly"" ban! "
neutral|The air can kill you at this temperature.
neutral|I was pointing out the irony of [NAME] comment.
neutral|Miz Cracker is the worst parts of Aquaria and Trixie. Unprofessional pettiness and shadiness of Aquaria and the slightly problematic and sometimes delusional humor of Trixie.
joy|Ugh I wish!!! You‚Äôre not in the US?
neutral|We'll worry about it tomorrow
neutral|yep he joined the wrong org
anger|SE 89th just north of Brooklyn St is one of the worst I've driven.
joy|> People who aren‚Äôt stupid don‚Äôt get offended when Called stupid. Exactly. Well put. Thanks.
sadness|The thought of him having to schedule me in really turns me off and makes me sad. Has the reduced gaming time helped with intimacy in any way?
anger|The fuck? That ball was still on the ground tho.
surprise|I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything sad about how many people are attending from their country, but I am doubtful of their prospects!
joy|thanks, metropolitan looks legit according to google searches.
surprise|what are you doing here, [NAME]
joy|The best champagne
neutral|A life well spent....
joy|Man, I wish Fed was still 26 for these matches lol
joy|Oooh yes, great idea. Too bad there aren't any other duplicate names
joy|Haha I was about to say damn she straight up eviscerated her in between bites.
surprise|Crazy how [NAME] being a POS had been factual since the 90s but he‚Äôs only now feeling the consequences of his actions
joy|Typical [NAME], i know because i am one
anger|Eh, you can't really judge his character solely on the appearances he makes on his GF's IG without making a ton of presumptions
joy|What fun is this?? I love it!
joy|yes they do, and I am glad that you were able to change hers.
neutral|You go home now
neutral|*sees title* hello there!
joy|All i want is to be able to grab pig from an island and let it run freely on my deck
neutral|Welcome to MTV Cribs! The whole place is a giant bed for me
neutral|It was still controversial at the time which was my point.
joy|[NAME] pulling in his inner [NAME]
joy|Those sound yummy!
sadness|They blew up my feelings :'(
neutral|Here come the Doterra Boss Babes to the rescue!
neutral|You've been banned from /r/chicagobulls
joy|If you don't like it, you didn't have to comment. Just let people be happy.
joy|Thank you sound engineer for confirming that LOUD NOISE = FUNNY /s of course... thank you for your service.
joy|>she looks like squidward when she smiles LOOOL
anger|When you live where it's this cold, incessant complaining is a national pass time.
neutral|If this gets put in a video, hi mom!
sadness|Because she knows shame and he asked.
neutral|Because deceptive practices are easier than producing actual arguments in favor of your position.
neutral|This is me yesterday, oh and today.
joy|Yeah I reckon. I inspected the property too, just forgot to check/ask until after. I'll pass out of principal haha
joy|"INFJ hands down ""Being organised brings joy to me"""
joy|Stay there it‚Äôs been good luck
neutral|...... mmmm unforbidden ham
joy|wooosh! orange fans mad
sadness|I play those characters all of the time and have never, ever experienced this.
anger|"Saying ""no"" five-ten times then a reluctant ""yes"" to shut you up is not consent!"
neutral|That canopy looks like it could take someones head off.
joy|Good, I was hoping I wasn't putting false words in your mouth.
joy|Not to be confused with the toughest guy in the streets of Harlem.
joy|Ahh, that's why I love my country.
surprise|I was surprised the general public hadn't already heard of them tbh. They have been around for quiet sometime.
joy|I‚Äôve been there and it‚Äôs above a highway, feel like that might raise some eyebrows haha
fear|We all are afraid of losing our jobs here or being blackballed all the same.
surprise|Daaang [NAME] lost weight!!!! Is she making a comeback?
joy|Thank you!!!!!
neutral|I SAW THIS ORION IN HALF, AND WITH THE POWER OF SPEAR SPAM,,,,, :DDD
sadness|Oh my goodness.....I'm sorry. It's probably gonna take a long time to cope it.....
neutral|Give me liberty or give me death metal
neutral|Then believe me...he Always will be looking. It‚Äôs just the way it is with some guys.
joy|Thanks for the hug matey :)
joy|Happy Cake Day [NAME]! Use what talents you possess: the woods would be very silent if no birds sang there except those that sang best.
anger|What a weird character to use for something like this
anger|wow. how arrogant of him /s
surprise|He did all this road to find this coconut oil ! Are you ungrateful ? :( !
surprise|I have a very confused boner rn
joy|That's fine. I'm searching for the truth, not just the legal truth. To each their own.
surprise|why is this guy assuming the teen is some kind of southern pro slavery hick
joy|I actually realize this today. Woke up, swept the floor and the bathroom, have being amazing all day long.
neutral|The butcher seems to bug out, and not pay you, after around 3 horseback pelts, anyway.
joy|Well it depends on your level, class, and how good you roll.
neutral|What are they doing up there?
sadness|> **most government positions**, especially elected positions **don't have any education or skill requirements** FWIW Yea they do.
neutral|... ...I‚Äôll get back to you.
neutral|I drew that Godzilla!!! I'm OPs friend btw.
neutral|If you don't think MAGA hats are associated with racism then you've got your head stuck in the sand.
anger|They did this at one of my jobs. The icing on the 'fuck you cake' was the drivers' last day was 4 days before Christmas.
joy|This is the guy to talk to! Draftbuffs amazing and getting better constantly.
joy|Remember they are an ex for a reason. Seeing that smile probably made you remember all the happy times
neutral|12. He gets beat up by a total LOSER by the name of [NAME].
joy|You will not have damage to extremities when applied in a temporary situation as in this case. Simple as that.
joy|This is the truest statement I‚Äôve ever read about [NAME]. May he smile mercifully upon you.
joy|is a minimum score. If you don't get it you fail the ASVAB. It's a really simple concept.
sadness|The only part of church I'm sad my kids will miss.
neutral|"""[NAME]!"" *screeched the two apprentices as they tried to prove their worth to the the one who shall not be named*"
neutral|I seen reactions to this elsewhere and DAM famales are some sensitive fucers, you see something online and your whole life fall apart like üôÇüñ•Ô∏èüò¢üò≠üò¢üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
joy|Just give him a chance!
surprise|Right, that makes sense! I wonder if the person I met in real life would acknowledge he's more of a fence sitter than childfree, haha
joy|Go on Webtoons and look up Boo! It's sex. Great freaking sex ed comic.
surprise|Why so hateful. I feel sorry for you.
anger|Fuck a TD. I just want to survive [NAME].
joy|starting a new trend lol
joy|The ones who agree with her are the only ones who actually address *her* issue....which is how to deal with boundary stomping relatives.
neutral|It's pretty much a new format now, it must have been TF2 centred.
fear|You mean 0.08 - at 0.8 you'd be dead about twice over
joy|Every time there's a video in my sub box I get really excited and then it's Fortnite. It's heartbreaking.
neutral|just doesnt make sense... almost 30, already played in La Liga and they likely could have had him at any time he was there.
joy|I like this idea.
neutral|I‚Äôm just doing it ironically to own the libs! /s
neutral|Be prepared for a child support order. But my dad just decided he didn't want to pay any more and the CSEA was ok with that.
disgust|I am just utterly disgusted by it all
disgust|Degloved finger...*ouch*. One of the worst types of avulsions.
joy|"I think it's hilarious you guys think this will ""help"" [NAME] Yeah [NAME] was bad, but [NAME] didn't show very much either"
anger|I apologise for coming off as rude, the end comment was unnecessary and needlessly rude
anger|For fuck sake... just go and remind them it's the quiet train!
joy|The old ‚ÄúI had sex with your mom‚Äù joke. I chuckled a little.
joy|What a good pupper
surprise|Boy it sure is a hot one today, huh?
joy|Hope [NAME] is watching this but he's probably too busy snorting some lines
joy|It was a joke long before the meme haha
joy|I stand corrected! But, if that's the case, who is the world's second most famous groundhog (assuming [NAME] remains #1)?
anger|We don't. That is exclusively a leftist thing, and you know it.
joy|Wow, thanks! Now i am rich again!
anger|You don't ask some random woman her bra size and if she's a virgin. That's just so rude.
sadness|these have to be probably the worst presses ive ever seen, sorry mate
neutral|27 too many
joy|This dish is a testament to be beautify and ingenuity of Italian civilization and culture.
joy|I reallllly loved the show. It disturbed me a lot, definitely. But I want more now.
neutral|Instead of dumped underground at a later date, just dumped into the sea earlier. Despicable
joy|Even then, the commentor could have gotten the joke and was just being dead pan.
anger|Damn how do you post something directly to the front page?
joy|Thanks, I sort of bought myself the leadership role with that little stunt I pulled. I will do my best.
neutral|He's active tonight
neutral|My #1
neutral|Sorrow. Sorrow.
neutral|Wholesome encounters like this what keeps my hopes up for red dead online tbh
neutral|2 warm days and we all lose our minds? :)
anger|It's a shame you're sticking up for a dictator who orders the beating and shooting of protesters in the street.
joy|Hope you get ‚Äúat are it again‚Äù
joy|It's the end of the world as we know it...and I feel fine
anger|I hate Detroit
joy|Congratulations on the job interview! NParents seem to give the absolute *worst* job advice. I'm glad that you've figured that out earlier than I did!
neutral|Imagine [NAME] ever saying this.
joy|Pretty sure it‚Äôs a reference to Netflix‚Äôs ‚ÄúBird Box‚Äù movie. In which case - brutal; I love it.
joy|Im actually going to this game! One of the only chances every year I have to see the boys play in person. LET GO DEVILS
neutral|Over thinking things on both sides.
joy|Give her weed to make her asexual and want to have sex with you. Great [NAME] logic.
disgust|That is odd.
surprise|There were a surprising amount of surprised pikachus in this thread‚Äîthanks for the edit all the same.
joy|I would not feed her anything that would cause extra butt wiping. No effing burrito!
joy|This is actually so funny, this is something id expect from Australian sports media since we're shit at broadcasting but lmao
disgust|The stigma is justified. I dont care how you got it, it's still disgusting.
neutral|In whom? There are millions of people walking around today with no problems.
joy|This is the most Chicago music video I think I‚Äôve ever seen and I love it. Classic song!
neutral|I don't believe no one in your class thought of Mac or iPhone.
sadness|I feel like the last two seasons made me detach from the show.
joy|I really hope not. Personally I have no interest in VR games, and not even my favorite game would change that.
sadness|Oh my [NAME] I forgot about that movie
surprise|Wow grats man. Hopefully I can use this inspiration for myself tomorrow. If there was something new you learned in this experience would share it?
neutral|He should really let [NAME] come inside him
joy|Its probably just related to something she is dealing with. Stress/anxiety often causes nightmares. But there are plenty of potential
joy|Lol Yes Most people arent 100% either (especially women). For a variety of reasons...finding beauty in other people, curiosity, jealousy, etc...
neutral|I prefer to pay for my hugs, higher quality.
neutral|Which is exactly the point capt obvious.
sadness|I've seen guys who didn't know each other start conversations about sports. It all seemed very effortless.
joy|Well I mean Australia is a good example of this working isn‚Äôt it ?
joy|I love how the dog bites hard enough to pull it away, but soft enough to not kill it
anger|That sex doesn't exist and we're all just pretending for his benefit...
joy|I like you. No promo
surprise|Wait did he‚Äôs married with a family and tried getting in your pants?!
anger|No, that's not possible. If you have proof then it's not misinformation what your spreading but simply information.
joy|I‚Äôm very happy for you! Congrats! üòÅ
joy|I think there is a reality to that. Some of the focus has shifted to policing the language at the expense of dealing with more fundamental issues.
anger|Now you move onto personal insults. Well done O king of the waffles. Once again using a word (nuance) with no context. Bored now.
neutral|Try to get between us and our maple syrup and see what happens
neutral|His wife wears a burka too, lest her comely appearance detracts him from godly thoughts.
neutral|Ignorance is strength.
joy|‚ÄúYou fight like my sister!‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve fought your sister! That‚Äôs a compliment!‚Äù
joy|Lol my comment started all this again
joy|Lmao I love how no one replied to say you‚Äôre wrong but you had -1 upvotes
joy|Thanks for the input! I definitely want to check that out it looks beautiful Do you think a puffer jacket is necessary?
neutral|This!!!
joy|Yeah, because it‚Äôs soooo arduous to look at someone‚Äôs profile for five seconds.
joy|He absolutely loves it!!
neutral|If she stole a wallet with an activated card, or something along those lines. Once it's purchased, it's stealable.
surprise|Any good reading on [NAME]? I don't really know if I like her or not.
anger|Not any meaningful amount as far as I can tell. Although I‚Äôd love to be surprised
joy|I agree...I just tell them the card is declined. It happens to everyone
neutral|ya keep pretending you can tell people what to do... see how that works out for you
surprise|Are you able to see a therapist or counselor?
fear|That's your justification? You're a terrible person. Correction: You're a terrible child. Get some help.
neutral|Wait theres rats!!!??? Im calling health and safty!
anger|So much lost diversity...
joy|#THANK YOU FOR THE RED ARROWS. I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED IT WAS THE TOP COMMENT
joy|He had doubts but no matter, the baby changed his life and he wouldn't abandon it no matter what :)!
neutral|Getting the second one out of the way as well üôÑ
joy|[NAME] - Holdin on. Check out his music because he is honestly amazing.
neutral|Get more crushes.
neutral|It sounds like he doesn't know exactly what he wants and he's taking it out on you.
joy|Pleasure to meet you brother
joy|Please don‚Äôt give up like that. People gaslight you, and you just lie down and take it? You are stronger than that. üíï
surprise|OwO what's this?
neutral|Yes!!!
sadness|I have secondhand embarrassment for them both.
joy|Das pretty sweet. No-look throw!
joy|I knew her in high school- she's awesome!
neutral|It‚Äôs just speculation, but...yikes!
joy|You care more about their actions in that case.
joy|No, it is full of sexually repressed, nice guy idiots like you
neutral|That's what I was going for, but I felt like replying with /r/woooosh was too much of a cookie cutter response.
joy|The beautiful moment when Fridays and Sundays are your set days off and you have the PTO to cover Saturday üëçüèª
disgust|"I am truly sorry for you because that ""song"" is so awful"
joy|I agree you need to plan ahead. But you can't build infrastructure that will be heavily under-utilised and drive you broke to make.
joy|Neither, but I plan on it soon.
neutral|After 3 weeks of vacation, today is my final vacation day. Unfortunately, I go back to work tomorrow. not staying up for this one
joy|I found it using Guide to Purposeful Success. Hope it can help you the way it helped me!
anger|Can we stop suggesting [NAME] as [NAME] it's not happening.
neutral|This website is so strange.
neutral|"Also in response to /u/hyunL. There was. Among other things such as vocally wanting rape to be legalized, ""breeding"" farms, among other things. "
surprise|I‚Äôm intrigued.
joy|TELL TELL TELL. [NAME] I wish someone had told me.
sadness|No worries. Just didn't see them. My bad.
joy|It was more of a joke. I still have hope for [NAME]. Just kind of a tough sell at this point.
joy|That look is exactly like my Waffle House. And the one past that and a town over.
joy|Honestly wish [NAME] would just stop taking threes all together. They just don‚Äôt fall for him.
anger|You said you will turn 16 next year, this summer isnt next year
joy|True enough. I'd love more LGBT friendly horror.
sadness|Honestly it makes me sad but [NAME] does need less time:/
joy|Eh, sorry, found it, not my ex, thank goodness! Apologies!!
anger|[NAME], if you're doing an Undertale deal, not having a red heart on your ass is inexcusable.
neutral|Is that meat or veggies?
anger|The fact that [NAME], the other principal in the original story, has gotten out of this unscathed is annoying.
anger|AP can tell them to leave, and then call the cops if they don't. Soliciting/begging is not allowed on Target property.
neutral|Where is the problem? **Just do it again!**
joy|Well good luck and have fun!
surprise|OMG! I can only imagine. I've gotten it into a hang nail before and that was NOT fun.
joy|Of course he does lol. Not very often, but he definitely has to block from time to time.
anger|I don‚Äôt even like basketball that much. Chill out man
anger|Teen spirit sure ain't what it used to be...
joy|Just cut your losses, get out and don't look back!
sadness|Though underwear would have made this less embarrassing, I wear it for a different reason.
neutral|That's what I thought too man
anger|You just posted the same thing but made it worse.
sadness|Bet Highland Council are sorry they sold their bunker last year.
joy|That might be an issue when it comes to meeting girls all the way around. Generally we love a guy who can make us laugh.
surprise|I'm surprised he hasn't already. He was charged on Dec. 31st but his name was only released yesterday.
joy|$20 paywall out $20 'starter pack' in ‚Äî this would be great
anger|No, because vaccines are recommended worldwide. And also, not amputating a body part.
anger|Looks wise you sound dateable but no, I wouldn't date you, because you seem to have an overemphasis on appearance
surprise|/r/keto too believe it or not.
neutral|Looks like he drops the chainsaw right as the branch hits him
neutral|I'm sure it was Leyou, the Chinese chicken farm company, that had shares, and not Tencent.
neutral|Nope. This is shown with [NAME] spider-man having reversed version of the Raimiverse spider-man, a la the upside down kiss having [NAME] on the bottom instead.
sadness|I am vuri disappointed in you. You gained turdy pounds tis munt. Scale dont lie
joy|Give it time people will figure out the truth if you engage with her then that gives her what she wants. She will definitely use that against you.
surprise|Why is [NAME] out? Is it a rest thing or a minor injury?
neutral|Whatever you do, don‚Äôt try to use a bone to get it out. It‚Äôll only make it worse.
neutral|When bear attacks kick him I'm the ball!
joy|Takeover was great but the spectacle of the rumble match itself makes it more interesting for me. Same with MITB and elimination chamber.
joy|I see him doing that.
fear|When I get a brain freeze, I grab my chest and throat. Very painful. Then i keep eating.
disgust|Bless this woman. That honestly sounds horrific from every end. I hope her ex [NAME] has lived a horrendous life since perpetuating that disgusting act.
joy|You're right, thank you.
anger|errrrrrrrrr that's pointless, and your Doctor I'm afraid is pointless as well.
joy|I'm 39 and still love being given chocolate.
joy|Women have a right to their own bodies. Your comments are horribly patronizing. They indicate that women intellectually develop slower than men which is sexist.
sadness|Sorry to hear that, I have it for ps4 and hardcore dlc servers are still up
surprise|No, but it can cost more than the minimum wage.
joy|Like have an anti interventionist foreign policy.
joy|Funny you say that... krav maga is quite popular in Evanston.
neutral|The ghost of [NAME] saves the day!
surprise|That guy talked bad about his haircut I guess
neutral|Especially when it's right in your FACE
neutral|Just think of it as set in an alternate universe where America didn‚Äôt just take independence but went back to England and established their own colonies there.
joy|Could be an attainability thing. My personality is very aloof and I tend to have much better results with more confident girls in general.
joy|yes i did, thanks for explaining
anger|What rights do men have that women don't in the west? Damn.
neutral|I support abortion
neutral|I'd let him destroy me with facts and knowledge üò©üò©üò©
disgust|It's been with me all day. Those reams of entries is one of the most quietly horrific things I've ever seen.
neutral|I have faith
surprise|It surprises me that he's a mod some days...
anger|That sucks! Your lady giblets are NONE of her damn business. Does your BF at least try to curb her mouth?
joy|Someone somewhere wants to be cuddled too. You'll never find that person if you don't talk to anyone you want to cuddle with.
neutral|Austin Powers that shit
joy|Yes to momentum. The time spent between phases is important. It‚Äôs also bad matchmaking
neutral|Fuck yeah! Bring on 2019
neutral|Mine do honestly, but I try not to use mine much when I‚Äôm in public with people because that‚Äôs tacky.
anger|[NAME] is always late to meetings
neutral|Ah yes, resort to ad-hominem attacks when you have nothing else to say.
joy|Dude, I can't express in words how much relief this man brings to my soul.
joy|This is perfect
disgust|I dated a guy from Steamboat Springs Colorado who used to do this. He had an immune system made of steel but it was absolutely disgusting.
joy|What a snake. Typical Fort Mcmurray politics.
neutral|It wouldn‚Äôt be our biggest free agent signing in a second considering he‚Äôs not a free agent.
surprise|Dying to find out who it is

joy|Love Galore pt.2 üíØüî•üî•
joy|Nah. Enjoy your free food
joy|I think you should manage your hopes and expectations that you have about her. Start dating other people. Let her go
sadness|The unfortunate thing is that, right now, that **is** how it works in politics, it‚Äôs just been made extremely obvious the last few years.
joy|Oh you magnificent person. Yes please.
joy|The keg talent is awesome with a touch of honey and another round turning [NAME] into a mage
neutral|So is [NAME] the frontrunner for Executive of the Year, pre trade deadline?
sadness|I'm a woman and I lost mine at 26 (was just a later bloomer) This obsession with virginity is odd.

sadness|Sorry to hear that, brother. Why do you feel more lonely now compared to usual?
surprise|Or at least it could have been, but the pic is gone :(
neutral|Here's an excerpt from Australian law that seeks to define hate
joy|Maybe you should smoke some and relax.
neutral|Certain mental health issues can be smelled on a person; by all accounts, schizophrenia makes a person's sweat smell like goat
anger|Dumb people. Poor person. The wolf was the only one who wanted to help!
surprise|Z-axis...? You mean the spontaneous propulsion system or is it something else?
joy|I love lists. And problem solvers. I need you in my life.
joy|this is r/comedyheaven content alright. frick u i love it.
joy|"Watch the movie ""The Big Short"". You'll love it. Promise."
neutral|"But ""questioning"" overwhelming evidence presented with a comprehensive explanation without any sort of counterargument is perhaps better called *denying*."
sadness|I‚Äôm battling depression and anxiety and having a healthy diet and loosing weight has helped me
neutral|Oh my god. You *actually* asked reddit first? Fucking hell.
neutral|the rubber coming off is always a problem

joy|"I love the people who confuse this sub for some kind of ""intellectual"" gathering lmao"
joy|I'm working in a creative industry; you'd probably fair well.
surprise|I am sorry but what is a wholesome meme
joy|Nice vid, is this a modded server? I see that sexy G36...
joy|[NAME] for sure
joy|I would love that. [NAME] and [NAME] were easily my favourite supporting characters of season 2
neutral|Man they must really hate [NAME] out of position at SF. But let‚Äôs play [NAME] at SF that should work.
surprise|Had to go check for myself
anger|Right? I hear too many horror stories of people ordering online and not getting the copy on the release date. I would be so pissed.
joy|I was thinking of that. I used to love the Naked Gun movie and he is reminding of [NAME] character, who would get injured every scene
joy|Yo COURTTV bout to get a ratings boost.
joy|I mean, struggle enough, the ropes will become loose. You'll live, go to the police, and get in some kind of protection.
neutral|Proper us of cell phone while operating a motor vehicle. Good for you.

neutral|Needed this going through the same thing 4ight now and this definatley will keep me going !
neutral|Think I'm gonna get a chance radio, so I can talk to other car beds.

sadness|Wow that's a burden, I'm sorry.
neutral|Just don‚Äôt be born on a raped planet. Jeez why do you damned virgeens make such a fuss?

joy|I‚Äôm sorry. He‚Äôs in a better place. I hope you can keep the good memories
neutral|well, they never said anything about curing her...
sadness|i just was disapointed because [NAME] wont have the chance to play with the GOAT. i didnt mean to smh to your comment

neutral|[NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] looks like... He ain't natty
joy|I love the twist you did on the ‚Äúit‚Äôs all gravy‚Äù idiom. Definitely saving this comment to refer back to when I need life advice
neutral|> It's almost like people are people I've been saying this a lot lately.
anger|Anzac day rules are even dumber
joy|I recommend this. I read the WN and it fucked up my English for months. English is my second language...
joy|Genuinely, it is! The only complaint is that kentrosaurus is spikey as hell, and I find him with my foot in the dark fairly often...
neutral|If we didn‚Äôt throw out offers after [NAME] himself has been all over it. Then lynch needs to get checked.
neutral|I don't disagree, but if he's open he's gonna shoot
joy|I would agree. That doesn‚Äôt really address the conservative versus alt-right labeling issue though.
disgust|Weirdly enough that's my favorite part of his videos: the ending sting/title card It reminds me of old school racing and fighting games with those over-the-top announcers
anger|No it's not >:(
neutral|I figure if I'm being held up by my waist, I have better shot at your knee than your groin.
joy|I think I found the rom somewhere, now I just gotta set it up. I hope I can manage to do that.

neutral|I got your back, bros. (nsfw, duh)
joy|Thanks for the kind words but some things are in fact permanent. Still I appreciate your reply. Thank you.
joy|Oh man I actually ugly laughed out loud. This is awesome üòÇ
