neutral|I'd hesitate to even call this a wound, but if you insist. 50 caps should cover my expenses.
neutral|If someone came up to you and offered you a thousand caps for your name, would you take it?
neutral|What'll fight on Blue?
neutral|If we had just one more squad, we could easily install a sheriff and still handle our primary objective of protecting the interstate south of here.
neutral|We don't have the money to pay for the water, so I rigged the pump station to divert water to the local cisterns from time to time.
neutral|You have to get Mr. House out of the way, that's what! And then we'll install me on the Lucky 38's mainframe!
neutral|Done.
neutral|No idea. Sounds like you two had a history for him to act like that. And turn down the money, too.
neutral|Nice charlies, too! Give them a shake for the Ben-man, will ya? Hello!
neutral|Bye.
neutral|Mr. House afforded her every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38, mostly as a reward, but partly out of fear.
neutral|Heard Crocker's running the Embassy - guy's funny, and not in a hee-haw way. More like a see-saw with his politics.
anger|Mmm, now that feels good.
neutral|Only times he speaks up are to insult you. He's a real prick, by the way. And I'm supposed to get information out of this guy.
joy|Ah, General Oliver. I expected you would survive.
neutral|That one was pretty good, right? How about another?
neutral|We make sure that they only enter or leave the bunker while the sandstorm is active, to avoid detection.
disgust|What? Did you expect me to applaud your efforts to support a deranged warlord?
neutral|I don't see him with you. Bring him to me and I'll take a look. Otherwise, I'll just be guessing.
neutral|Suppose it depends on what you think is "good." Most folks want to hear about Hoover Dam and Boulder City, but it's a long story.
neutral|If you want to catch a show and have a few drinks, you should definitely hit up the Aces Theater in The Tops.
neutral|That's... not really for me to say. It's a bit of a touchy subject. You should probably forget I mentioned it.
anger|Might be a little tougher than the Crimson Caravan - Van Graffs are like a nest of rattlers, and the guns they've got are Brotherhood-caliber.
neutral|Yes, do you have something to report?
neutral|Fuck, no. If I knew where this bitch was, do you think I'd be asking you?
anger|Report to Legatus Lanius immediately - he'll brief you on the plan of battle. Come back victorious, or don't come back.
neutral|Yeah... that's Cook-cook. Did he always smell like this? Even before he was dead? And the Fiends let this guy touch their food?
neutral|Recently I've heard about several incidents where some of you have been seen running away from a fight where battle cattle were involved.
anger|Women might as well be dirt... not anxious to join them.
anger|Probably because it used to be Miguel's. Whoever he was. How about if you let me go, huh boss?
neutral|Eyebot Duraframe Subject E is both the prototype, and the last functional model in this test group.
neutral|Eventually, she parted ways with the Courier and traveled west, seeking the remnants of her past.
neutral|The NCR hasn't raised hell over our breakout, and I want to find out why. They're up to something, I can feel it.
neutral|Oh? And in your expert opinion, why would that be?
neutral|We must always remember that wherever Californians stand, we carry our principles with us:
neutral|It's great. Really. Yeah. So anyway...
neutral|I won the fucking lottery, hear me! So fuck y'all! Whoohoo!
disgust|The only tribe in the Legion is the Legion. Caesar is their chief, father, and god all rolled into one.
surprise|You play on my instincts. Yet your intention in this... you have nothing to gain by telling me of this... "trap."
neutral|Hahaha! I knew there was a positive in it somewhere!
neutral|I figure we'll hang around Goodsprings for awhile, maybe get some of the other gangs to join up with us.
neutral|Now, I trust we're done discussing this. I'm going to step through that door and pretend like we never had this talk.
neutral|After their victory at Hoover Dam, the Legion quickly set about destroying all remaining resistance, including any groups with ties to the NCR.
neutral|Look, I already told you that was bullshit. Probably just an excuse those lying soldier scum made up to not share their grub with us.
neutral|As screwed up as it sounds, at least she was part of something. Granted, it was something... admittedly, pretty bad, but it was something.
neutral|More worrying is the fact that our sources suggest the violence is being perpetrated by the gang that runs the place, the Kings.
neutral|Proceed to your accomodations. Please, enjoy your stay at Vault 21.
neutral|And for close-range suppression and crowd control, we have this handy-dandy 9mm submachinegun! Nice!
joy|Are you kidding? The supplies in this are going to save lives. Thank you.
neutral|Hurry! We've got to get some before they notice us!
neutral|Years back, we met with the Desert Rangers at Mojave Outpost and agreed to help them against Caesar if they would join the NCR.
sadness|A lot of this is my fault. It's only right that I stand with them.
neutral|All you have to do is destroy the power generators! Without the generators, Hoover Dam's just a big bunch of concrete!
joy|Overt flirtation will get you everywhere, you know.
neutral|You'll be meeting face-to-face with the mighty Caesar himself, founder of the Legion, conquerer of 86 tribes.
neutral|The Scribes are responsible for discovering how all the old tech we recover actually works and sometimes even work on inventing new things.
neutral|
joy|Here's a guy that's been beat all to hell, right? I mean, he could have retired from the service, but instead he signs back on and does what he can.
neutral|Cachino is usually on this floor in Brimstone, having drinks. If he isn't there then he's probably in his room upstairs.
joy|Once we get rid of the Legion, this will be a better place for everyone, and I'm proud to be a part of that.
neutral|He gave orders to hold the plant until it could be reactivated. But he ran out of time. The NCR overran it. Everyone thought he was dead.
neutral|I should've left a long time ago. Cut my losses before it came to this.
joy|Yeah, and we'll kick their ass again like we did at HELIOS One - tell them to come, we got a whole mess of armor-piercing rounds.
neutral|I help tend the crops, stand watch for Fiends, and generally help keep things civilized.
neutral|The surviving Great Khans were relocated to an isolated, barren reservation, well north of NCR trade routes.
joy|Rest stop.
neutral|Okay, I'll tell you everything I know, like I promised.
neutral|Just hanging out. Same as usual.
fear|Wha-? Oh, shit. I heard of you. Look, we didn't mean nothing by this. Just following orders. You want us gone, we're gone - no problem.
neutral|Even the flies here are chemed.
neutral|If I had my way I'd dump it in the scrapyard in Novac and be done with the damn thing.
neutral|As decades passed, what had been the American southwest united
neutral|See that? Vegas, right? Same as always - but not tonight!
neutral|Ah, yes - we are forbidden from speaking his true name. He was a shaman of some kind before he met Caesar, a holy man from out of the Utah.
neutral|Utobitha, I'm here with Best Friend Tabitha, who has a message for all the dumb-dumbs out there.
neutral|I look after the only reasons anyone would want to spend any time here. I'm a pimp.
disgust|Either way, I'm not going to wait around for you to help the Legion roll across Hoover Dam. Bye.
neutral|We had the same discussions when he first appeared, and the same lack of success. He believes he is one of us.
neutral|But you'll learn all there is to know in due time. Legatus Lanius, Monster of the East, will soon arrive to command Caesar's troops in battle.
neutral|The facility was run by the NCR for a time, but the prisoners overcame their guards and used the prison as a base from which to conduct raids.
neutral|Hmph, I thought you were made of sterner stuff than that. The Brotherhood could use someone with your skills.
neutral|Yes! This is going to be fun!
neutral|Hi there, my name is April Martimer. I monitored a communication earlier between you and someone with the Brotherhood of Steel.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
anger|Probably because it used to be Miguel's.
neutral|All Gun Runner merchandise is constructed on-site.
neutral|Oh, all kinds of things! There was already information regarding the layout and systems of this bunker, but we've since added our own data as well.
joy|Yeah, I knew about it. They're still young, and they weren't going to go very far.
neutral|My parents were killed as examples. The rest of us, chained and dragged to some kind of camp. A Centurion there chose me as his tent servant.
neutral|That's too bad. I was hoping to melt some more down for machining.
neutral|I can spare a little time. What did you want to talk about?
neutral|Maybe they'll be devoured by giant scorpions! All sorts of things could happen to them out there!
joy|Won most of those fights, too. Can take a hell of a punch and give it right back when I've got a bottle in me.
joy|Thanks to you, I think we're in good shape. The squad seems to be functioning much better as a unit now.
neutral|I been a fink to you, caused more than my share of grief by a hard mile. Let me go, you won't see me again.
sadness|I was born just outside Mexico City. My family had a little ranch there. After they died, I took my little sister, my Rafaela, to Mexico City.
surprise|I count on no one.
neutral|I'll be waiting right here!
neutral|The healthier you are, the more implants I'll be able give you. Now, what surgery are you considering?
neutral|Real subtle. Here you go. Play some games. Have some fun.
neutral|Very well. You can tell Reyes that this station is secure.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|You know, I've had thousands of employees in my time. Few met my expectations, fewer still surpassed them.
sadness|Hnh. Long ago... when taking Denver, I had to face such a challenge. Many died, over many years to claim the city as ours.
neutral|<whimper>
sadness|True enough, I suppose. Getting them back together must be worth more than me spraying plasma all over the dam.
neutral|Help me get my research to a stage where I can hand it over to my assistant, Calamity, and then ask me about this again.
neutral|The stranger said he would happily share his family's recipe for the drink, on one condition.
neutral|If you're here to see the Major, then I suppose it's all right. Head on through.
neutral|There's my alarm - time to take my pills.
anger|Looking to make a deal, then? All right... let's hear it.
neutral|I'll sit tight.
neutral|Head on back and see the boss real soon, hear? Evening.
joy|Music to my ears.
neutral|Today, children, we are going to read another chapter from True Police Stories.
neutral|Ask away.
sadness|I don't think it was as hard hit as DC or Bakersfield, but it was bad enough. By the time we got there, the city was a radioactive ruin.
sadness|I am sorry, meant no offense. The billboards are not ready yet... Please, I need more time, more materials!
neutral|Hurry! We've got to get some before they notice us!
neutral|Need to lighten my load.
neutral|"The Street" - Vegas Boulevard.
neutral|Heavy weapons trooper. Nothing better than hosing down a target with an excess of bullets and laser fire.
neutral|I've proven my loyalty. All you're doing is killing a loyal soldier. If that's Caesar's policy, then I say his empire will crumble.
neutral|Not a bit. I imagine there must be some people around curious about that kind of technology.
neutral|Sure. Here's what I've got.
neutral|Report him to Colonel Hsu. Do all that and we should be free and clear.
neutral|It was... strange. Even for Father Elijah. He's always been unstable, but this was... something else.
neutral|Thankfully the small group in town here seem to have split off from the main force, so they aren't getting anything in the way of support.
neutral|Take care of yourself.
neutral|When there's an example of that kind of success... that can shake things up enough so the good that came with the intention shines through.
joy|It'll frighten them. If I can reach out and kill whomever I choose, then they know the only reason they're alive is I haven't tried yet.
neutral|What was on it? What did he say?
neutral|Now all I need is some shame to wash it down with.
neutral|Freeside's not like that. Everyone here is free to do whatever they want, and I for one wouldn't want it any other way.
surprise|I have to admit, I did not expect that sort of response.
neutral|You're a real piece of work, you know that?
joy|Oh, don't you dare play that game with me. Fine, here's the key since it's so important to you. Just don't say where you got it.
anger|You got a spare piece, boss, or do I have to break out the tubing?
neutral|He's one of the Chairmen, big shots who run The Tops casino in New Vegas. A friend from the city contacted me with info on a big job.
neutral|Promising, but I won't be able to synthesize the drug anytime soon. I really should get back to my work.
neutral|Preferring neither the best of the NCR nor the worst of the Legion, the Courier was the woman responsible for a truly independent New Vegas.
neutral|They stayed here a night, and was up by the dinosaur talking to the sniper fella with the moustache a couple of times.
neutral|It's a long story. And I'd get tired of talking before it was through.
neutral|What about Boulder City?
neutral|Sometimes we forget that the light of our society shines beyond our borders.
neutral|You're actually going to do this all over again?
neutral|
neutral|Like I said, mind your own damn business.
neutral|"Nowhere's" a strange place to get an idea like that.
neutral|Yeah. West, East - and passed through places enough times people would sometimes pay me some caps to take something to the next town.
neutral|I'm gonna need some new limbs.
neutral|We're lucky to be here, alive and well. The land's a mystery to us, but we'll find our place in it.
neutral|The rangers heroically assisted NCR's troopers in their ill-fated defense against the overwhelming power of Caesar's Legion.
joy|A little safe ground.
neutral|Those few who avoided the Courier's wrath moved north, into the wilderness of Idaho, where they tried once more to rebuild.
neutral|What do you have to say for yourself?
neutral|No, imbecile, that's not how it works. I set up the fights, then you go in the arena and fight.
neutral|Three flavors to choose from - Sweetie, Maude, and Jimmy. Sweetie's the house favorite, for reasons that should be obvious.
neutral|Nope, not interested. No caps in letting people walk, you know.
neutral|That is the standard procedure, yes. For example, McNamara gives orders to Head Scribe Taggart, who then relays further orders to the scribes.
neutral|Have a look.
neutral|She began secluding herself in crumbling libraries of the Old World, learning of promising technologies she knew the Brotherhood would never adopt.
neutral|I'm already shadowing you, aren't I? Lead on, I'll follow.
joy|Sure, boss. What do you want to know?
neutral|I agree with Crocker that a more peaceful solution is preferable, especially for the long term.
neutral|If you don't know what Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars are and think ol' Festus is just shooting his mouth off, say "Star Info".
neutral|Now they'll only blow up the right sorts of people! That's what matters!
neutral|Let me help you slip into something a little more comfortable.
neutral|It would be imprudent to worry them unduly without first discovering the facts of the situation.
neutral|
neutral|Forget about the President! We've got something more important to take care of!
neutral|I haven't been able to get it up and running again. I was hoping to use it for some courier work, but that ain't gonna happen.
neutral|Really? Talk about diplomatic skills! I mean, just not getting blown up was a success!
neutral|Arcade's group was run down somewhere near Westside. There were no survivors.
neutral|I'd like to help - but we can't spare any more units. We have to maintain a minimum headcount at the Outpost, orders from the West.
fear|Blow on the dice, baby. We're gonna need luck to get outta here alive.
neutral|Me and my partner Saint James work salvage around Westside, that's all.
neutral|He's the best the Legion has to offer, or so the Legionaries say. Brute of man, wears a fancy metal mask into battle.
neutral|Before Hoover, we had five kill reports on Graham from rangers and 1st Recon sharpshooters who tried to take him out.
neutral|Which means this little "Duraframe" sucker somehow managed to survive for over two thousand miles. Certainly lives up to its model name.
surprise|Really? Thanks for the reminder, boss, I'd almost forgotten.
neutral|Few openly blamed the rangers for Hanlon's treachery, but public and political support for the organization quickly dwindled.
neutral|Internal sabotage took down the oil rig - never did get the full story. The NCR took out Navarro, saying we posed a threat to the region.
neutral|Do you?
neutral|I would. But I've gotta watch the road. Caesar's Legion has been taking territory just east of here. They took Nelson.
neutral|Best of luck to you. I'll tell the others to take a break so they don't get in your way. Oh, and I'll keep track of when it jumps for you.
neutral|Soon after, the Mojave was filled with tales of the ghost-vaquero who hunts down those who prey on the weak.
neutral|Done.
neutral|That's right. Nothing gets in or out of here without me knowing it.
neutral|Unfortunately, no. In fact, the word from the Ranger stations has been especially concerning lately.
neutral|Good. Two of my scouts have reported seeing patrols of men in power armor near Hidden Valley. Begin your search there.
neutral|Shit. You sound like the LT. I should've w-woken up. I shouldn't have gotten knocked out in the f-first place.
neutral|It's a pride thing with her, and totally unnecessary. I mean, look at me - I was Ranger Sterling until the Legion got through with me.
neutral|Shit, I'd settle just for the women.
neutral|What?... Those bastards! Selling folks off to the Fiends? Selling children - to Cook-Cook...?
neutral|It helped. A little. Well, more than a little. Betsy ought to pay a visit to Usanagi since it can't hurt none.
neutral|I learned what I don't want to become.
joy|Sure thing.
anger|You'd best step up your performance with this next assignment...
neutral|Done.
neutral|Reluctantly, the Followers accepted the offer and abandoned Old Mormon Fort to the Legion.
neutral|Though a cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia was eventually found, it became a case of too little, too late for Jacobstown.
neutral|Thirty seconds left!
neutral|We're located up by the old train station, in the northwest part of town. Just tell the guards "Hope" and they'll let you through.
neutral|Your guess's as good as mine. Probably better.
neutral|Suit yourself.
neutral|Hold up there, that looks like Enclave tech. Take that over to Knight Lorenzo if you get a moment, he may be able to get some information out of it.
joy|You can bet on that, boss.
joy|You have, have you? Misdirection. When you're pinned down, outnumbered, and two days from any help, it's just about the best friend you can have.
anger|Head's spinning - must've got stung.
neutral|Are you kidding me? I can't ship these things fast enough. People love them!
neutral|He was around not too long ago. He's probably down on the casino floor now.
neutral|Driven into a frenzy by their use of Psycho, the Misfits inflicted heavy casualties on the Legion during the defense of Camp Golf.
neutral|Defying Chief Hanlon's worst fears, NCR's rangers persevered and distinguished themselves during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
neutral|Nothing, man.
neutral|Then I'll stand on my own, just like I always have. Just like a King should.
joy|Name's Raul. Raul Alfonso Tejada. I'm the mechanic around here.
neutral|Right, and they'd probably give us all medals, too. Maybe I should kill a hostage because you wasted my time with this shit.
neutral|You were just curious. No harm in that. I'm just worried sick about my friend here.
neutral|You must be new. Your tune'll change, trust me.
neutral|It ain't so bad. If Caesar's Legion decides to push West through Nipton ol' Mojave Outpost here will be the front line.
joy|Sure, it stinks to hang out here, but it won't be forever. Plus I can afford a monthly bender on the Strip and still build up my nest egg.
neutral|That beat up old pile of bolts? What do you want to know?
neutral|I have some free time, ask away.
neutral|With this accomplished, all preparations will have been made. The battle for Hoover Dam will be upon us before long.
neutral|Look, I know you came all this way, and that takes some drive, especially these days.
anger|I guess he had visions that a smoothskin would stop by.
neutral|If they can be convinced to fire those big cannons at the Legion or NCR, though, well - that'd be neat, wouldn't it?
neutral|Normally, there'd be a ceremony and such, but everyone is too busy at the moment for such frivolity.
neutral|People can do whatever they want, they just have to keep in mind what'll happen afterward.
neutral|All quiet at the moment. Ranger Beaumont is in charge here, but he's off leading a patrol.
anger|The mighty Caesar has bestowed upon you his Mark and guaranteed safe-conduct. If he wanted you dead, you would be dead already.
neutral|I need someone to look into this that won't attract attention. Would you be interested?
neutral|That right? You killed one of the psychopaths on my shitlist? Let me see the scumbag's head...
neutral|Let me get out of town before we talk. Too many unfriendly ears around.
anger|And even if we hold this dam, what then? Are we going to send the NCR's men and women to die here for another five years? Ten?
neutral|Given how you're a new arrival, I also recommend that you get to know some of the region's tribes, so you can decide how you feel about them!
neutral|Hoo boy, Gloria's gonna have your ass for letting that wino in. You're not starting the day well, rookie.
neutral|Tell your ruler we have no interest in such ties. Caesar's Legion is a collection of unclean barbarians.
neutral|Exactly what I was thinking. It's nice to have a little style, you know?
anger|Then get to it.
neutral|Comm rangers send the intel up the station chain until it reaches Camp Golf.
neutral|Let's proceed.
neutral|All I'm saying is, not much of a chance they'll accept a Vegas that polices itself with robots!
joy|I guess I can make an exception, just for you.
anger|Some of the Brotherhood scribes we captured further East didn't even know the name of their founder, Roger Maxson.
neutral|It'll be easy enough to purge all rads from your system.
neutral|I can only do that if you're a friend of the Legion. I don't want to get crucified.
neutral|Dangerous... I like that. Maybe it's time people starting being afraid of me rather than the other way around.
neutral|Goodbye.
neutral|Okay, I need some answers, now. These guys just barged in here and said they were under orders to keep me here until you arrived.
neutral|He'll keep his distance, setting ambushes, never suspecting that these bunkers house something far more dangerous to him than criminals. Well-played.
neutral|So far, all first generation Super Mutants that have come to Utobitha have left not soon after.
neutral|No, but I've been laid up for a while now. Haven't been able to keep an eye on things like usual.
neutral|What? Why the hell not?
neutral|There must be a bunch of them holed up there! Not a good place for a robot to visit!
neutral|That's just fucking great. I knew you didn't have what it takes from the start, but would Glory listen to me? No.
anger|Great Khans! Drive Caesar's dog out of our camp! If he's too slow to flee, kill him!
neutral|The Legion, preoccupied with its acquisition of New Vegas, scarcely took notice of the town of Goodsprings.
neutral|I hadn't thought about that name in a long time. I was just a child, and he had a big mole in his rear bumper.
neutral|Did he say anything when you met him? Anything...anything at all?
neutral|You might be on to something. I like to hang on to any weapons mods I run across...
neutral|It took years for Caesar to conquer Lanius' tribe, and Caesar showed mercy to the survivors, allowing them to join the Legion.
neutral|Uh, I don't know. Did you hit that switch I, ah, keep telling you not to press?
joy|It helps get them back on track, and does it by example. And what you've done here today, that's going to keep us going for a while.
neutral|Still, my sister has plans for you, so I'll cut you a break. You bring the girl here, and I'll take care of the fun part. That's fair, eh?
neutral|All right. What did you wish to speak about?
neutral|5... 4... 3... 2... 1!
joy|Well it's time to pop your Vegas cherry, friend! I'm sure you'll have a blast and be drunk and capless in no time.
neutral|You already took care of House, so when you get the Chip, all you have to do is let me know.
neutral|Yeah, if he vouches for you, I guess I can trust you.
neutral|He spent his leave time hunting down slavers in the desert, his First Recon beret the last thing they never saw.
anger|Just as I thought, McNamara gave my men new orders without telling me. The nerve of that man!
neutral|Hmmm... you're a long-term thinker, man. I like that. You might be on to something there.
neutral|Nope, not going to be that easy.
neutral|...Yes. When I first discovered how much the systems had deteriorated, I reported it to the Elder right away.
neutral|Ever since the 15 shut down, all caravans come through here - right to me. I check the stock and direct deliveries onward to meet orders.
neutral|Well, don't just stand there. I ain't getting any younger.
neutral|Since our membership isn't open to outsiders, some members think that obligates all of us to procreate.
neutral|Few mourned their absence.
sadness|Well-spoken, traveler. Well spoken indeed. Perhaps it's time to find our own destiny unburdened by the past.
neutral|Oh, there are patrols. Just not exploratory ones. We've been in a state of lockdown for... well, let's just say it's been a while.
neutral|If there's a reason to attack NCR, Camp Golf's a reason.
joy|But once they were in, they were stuck there. Oliver's troopers were entrenched and wouldn't give a foot.
sadness|Old enough to know better, boss. Old enough to know better.
neutral|See? Told you so.
sadness|After the raiders were dead, I salvaged what I could from the store. I was tired... I just wanted to be alone forever.
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|The rangers, along with NCR's many troopers, shared the glory of victory.
neutral|Veronica.
neutral|Maybe I'll sleep good tonight... Here, take this. It's how I say thanks.
disgust|Ugh. So gross. It was bad enough that I didn't get any data out of the Securitron. This is why I didn't want to talk about it.
anger|Think you got the guts to carve out a frontier? Build towns, protect the roads, run supplies, train troops?
neutral|You're absolutely right. You must've had run-ins with them. As have I...
surprise|Is it any wonder my Legion has so little love for you?
neutral|What you say is true. I apologize for my rash action - it was out of grief and loyalty. I hope you understand.
neutral|Only seen snow, not walked through it. Crazy - frozen water? Should package this shit.
neutral|History says otherwise.
neutral|He said the Brotherhood was doomed, but that he'd return, save us. But the way he said it... I don't know...
neutral|Just to the top of the ridge up here...
neutral|Before his crucifixion, he was brought before the Legate, who expressed his admiration for Boone's reckless abandon.
neutral|All right. A Ranger named Grant is in charge of security for the visit. He's the one you'll have to convince.
neutral|If you happen to find it, bring it here right away. I might be able to throw a few supplies your way if you do.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|Be careful they don't charge us any tolls.
neutral|Just kidding. You weren't doing any harm that I could see. So what do you think? Can it be fixed?
neutral|I don't know. I've gone through our records dozens of times looking for a precedent regarding the dismissal of an Elder and come up with nothing.
disgust|Not for all the whiskey in Reno.
neutral|No longer held in check by his conscience, Boone found lucrative work as a mercenary and assassin.
neutral|Told you before - it's too dangerous for a bunch of amateurs to handle.
neutral|Still, Jackson's not letting me out of his sight as long as there's still trouble up North.
neutral|But he hasn't. And I'm starting to think that if he doesn't find her that things will never go back to the way they were.
anger|Fine. I guess it doesn't matter anyway, keep it. I won't ask again.
neutral|Lost a lot of good men to this psychopath. Morale's going to be better, now that he's gone. Here's the bounty I promised.
anger|I should have you torn apart for speaking like that - but maybe you're right. The glory of the past is an empty dream.
neutral|Children, today we're going to read more from the Milsurp Review.
neutral|Name's Crandon, stranger. I keep an eye out for trouble around here.
sadness|It was the lines of food and water that nearly broke the Legion's strength... and the lack of tribals near that cursed city.
neutral|No... I suppose not. You've proved that you're a friend to us many times. I apologize for my temper.
disgust|He mustered the troops - as many as his senate would allow - and sent them in. All the right reasons, done all the wrong ways.
neutral|Good contact, Nash, used to be here. Had a son that went West.
neutral|We're the finest sniper outfit in the whole NCR. If you need a bullet put into a target's eye from 800 yards away, you call us.
neutral|But, when it was over, the Brotherhood, with all their fancy armor and weapons, was on the run. Nobody's heard from them since.
anger|Trigger's willing, chamber's empty.
joy|Ah, he's young, boss. He'll bounce back. Unlike some of us.
neutral|Here you go.
neutral|Funny how I make caps every time I open my mouth.
neutral|But maybe that's just something folks in the NCR cooked up to make themselves seem more useful here. Less uninvited.
neutral|Those were the best years of my life. Doing something that truly matters, and having the freedom to handle it as you see fit. Then I got injured.
anger|Is grandma's nap over already?
neutral|Good. You passed with flying colors. I told you it'd be fine. I expect you're wanting to know about that meal then, huh?
neutral|Preparations for the Great Journey were nearly complete when the demons appeared.
neutral|Exactly. We'll be shelling an unoccupied location in Outer Vegas to get their attention elsewhere.
neutral|I expect you're well familiar with my Securitrons by now.
neutral|Be seeing you. Maybe.
neutral|When the job is done, report back and I'll arrange for a team to clean up the site and retrieve the weapons.
fear|Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
neutral|10 of Spades really ought to keep his mouth shut, but he's right. There were a lot of things in my past I just couldn't leave behind.
anger|Jackson won't let me head north, it's not safe... and even though my caravan's gone, my caravan papers are keeping me here.
neutral|All right, then.
neutral|You speak like a hunter, yet only actions prove one's worth. The Thorn requires a tribute of blood, and so do I.
neutral|When they show their faces, that's when we go to work. One shot, one k-k-kill. That's the First Recon way.
neutral|Yeah, you could do with some work. It'll set you back 75 caps, but well worth it.
anger|Well I don't. I'm sure there were a few people turning a blind eye, but can you blame them?
neutral|Alright. 50/50 it is, but you better bring back all of the caps. If we hear you crossed us, the next bounty hunter will be coming for you.
neutral|I'm interested in medicine, but it's not my strong suit. I try to help out with any computer issues the Followers have.
surprise|Dead? What... by you? Yeah, I can tell, you had something to do with it.
neutral|Plasma rifles. They were intended to replace the P94 plasma caster.
sadness|I know that, boss. That's not what I'm getting at. I'm just getting sentimental in my old age. Anyways, forget it. Just wanted that off my chest.
neutral|He must have his own weapons supplies to keep as many laser-armed robots operational as he does. Makes me wonder where they are...
neutral|There'd be widespread panic. The Elder has the situation under control.
neutral|Freedom? Thank God Frank thinks we're enslaved.
neutral|As a matter of fact... it's funny that you'd ask. Couple nights back, I was on watch in the yard...
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
anger|Anyway, I found Black Mountain and offered my services, but Tabitha decided I was useful enough to keep around. Permanently.
neutral|They also said if they had to talk to me about my debt again, they wouldn't be nice the next time.
neutral|The Brotherhood used the information recovered from ED-E to create a small army of Duraframe Eyebots.
neutral|Smooth and easy, just the way I like it. Don't worry, they'll be as safe as kittens till you're ready to leave.
anger|Don't mind if I do. Enjoy your reign as King Scumbag the First, Overlord of Westside.
sadness|Nothing that wouldn't be wrong with any man who loses a wife, I suppose. Poor dear.
neutral|Jacobstown, constantly on guard for anti-mutant reprisals, never truly prospered.
anger|The next thing you know you're a pile of ash on the floor and someone's stepping out of a vertibird to sweep your remains into a Nuka-Cola bottle.
neutral|
neutral|I was thinking of taking a walk a little later.
joy|You're right. You do need a doctor. Lucky I happened along. But first let's discuss my fee...
neutral|I was a soldier. Why do you even care? I came out here to forget about the past, so quit bringing it up.
neutral|We got off to a bad start. What say we start over with a friendly game of Caravan? You know how to play?
neutral|Since they came to town he was keeping a good bit of notes on them, and he was slinking around Bison Steve when your pretty-boy friend came through.
neutral|The software upgrade also includes drivers for the Securitrons' highly sophisticated onboard auto-repair systems.
neutral|Well, there's the Lucky 38, Ultra-Luxe, Gomorrah, and The Tops. Which one do you want to know about?
neutral|anxiety,
neutral|While the NCR was busy fighting the Legion at Hoover Dam, some Kings took it upon themselves to attack NCR citizens and soldiers around Freeside.
neutral|Well, about time we got a soldier... and not a recruit, you look like you've seen some action.
neutral|Anything else you need? I've got work to do.
anger|It ended with nuclear bombs falling on my hometown.
neutral|Whatever.
neutral|Oh, Jimmy, don't you go being silly now! Come over here and give your grandma some sugar!
neutral|Just head to the northwest part of town, by the old train station. We start handing out supplies at six every night.
neutral|Welcome to another episode of Know - Your - Mutants!
neutral|Corporal White caught me taking the water and made me tell on Mr. Anderson. I think something bad happened, but Mr. Anderson told me not to worry.
sadness|Makes me a little teary-eyed, but now I've got a bottle to put 'em in. Hand over that paper, I'll put my name to it.
neutral|Hey, a dress! Thank you! I'm totally trying this on later.
neutral|Locating the virus would probably be nearly impossible, but the pompous little bastard that wrote it made things a little easier for us.
neutral|This'll just take a few moments, and it's all stuff that any real citizen of the NCR knows.
neutral|It's why you won't see Caravan in any casino - too slow-paced, and more importantly, no house edge.
neutral|Hey, no pressure. I'm just grateful you're willing to help me out.
neutral|You're listening to another edition of Know - Your - Mutants, with Best Friend Tabitha!
neutral|Hopefully, he's been making himself useful as a way of paying you back. But where are my manners, did you need something?
neutral|Same price as before, baby, and worth every little cap.
neutral|So you've been talking to Hardin, eh? He's been looking for a way to usurp McNamara ever since the lockdown started.
anger|Oh, to hell with this!
neutral|It's amazing that you've found any of them and not gotten gruesomely mangled. Keep up the good work!
neutral|It also gives me an excuse to stay out of any raiding parties. The gang can't lose its only doctor now, can it?
neutral|A piece of the action, huh? I don't think he's the sharing type, but okay.
neutral|My point before? Is that you know the Mojave, and it's a hard place.
neutral|Nope. Different fella. Bigger. Had himself a face on a screen, and he talked more like you or me.
neutral|Travelers in the region soon learned to avoid the roads at night, as caravans were repeatedly attacked by unseen assailants.
neutral|Nah, I'm gonna chill with my girl.
neutral|Our patrols are always bringing more stuff in. Take a look.
neutral|I need a new rifle.
neutral|It is indeed our duty to teach and improve the living conditions of our fellow man, but we're talking an insane amount of logistics to make this work.
neutral|Once here, most just stall out, can't go deeper into territory.
neutral|Here you go. Go easy on it until you train yourself to choke back the urge to gag. After a few bottles and the vomiting, it ain't so bad.
neutral|Graham's overconfidence forever branded him with fire, I will not follow his trail of fire into the depths of the Grand Canyon.
neutral|All together, the Mark II software upgrade confers a 235% increase in combat effectiveness per unit.
neutral|Why it's splendid. Simply to die for.
surprise|We thought nobody would ever manage to get past the radiation, and the ghouls!
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
anger|I shall make a cape of your skin. And your skull - it shall sit by my side, mute, watching as my armies march West.
neutral|Yes, that's the stuff. And the container's shielding must be intact, or you'd be dead by now.
neutral|This is what I been waiting to see! A big bad Khan bringing in the medicine! How about you toss some psycho my way?
neutral|We'll leave a few of them in that footlocker in the corner every so often. The Paladins scoff at using recycled ammo, so no one should mind.
neutral|Done.
joy|You're right. You do need a doctor. Lucky I happened along. But first let's discuss my fee...
neutral|And they're more accepting back West, like I said. In the meantime...
neutral|Well, assuming our equipment cache is intact, my squad would have the edge in armor and firepower.
neutral|Hmm. You should probably check on that, huh?
anger|The Gun Runners will be looking for revenge for the murder of their people. I won't sell you out, but be careful out there.
neutral|No, your role in this is done. The rest is up to us. There is much for me to do to make the transition as smooth as possible.
neutral|That does sound like a good plan. All right, you seem to know what you're doing, so you can count me in.
neutral|Used to be a Ranger... one of the first they sent out east, back before we took the Dam. Observation and reconnaissance.
neutral|You're probably right. Here, take it.
neutral|She usually works at the front of the Gourmand. She likes to see how people respond to it.
neutral|Yes, Rhonda.
neutral|Primm is important to our trade up from California, so having someone there who owes us a favor... that couldn't hurt.
surprise|What? Oh. Damn, no offense meant. Sometimes I get so drunk, I don't care who I share a bed with, so that's fine with me.
neutral|Even Caesar knows that General Oliver's coming back to Hoover. Colonel Moore's doing a fine job of running things over at the dam.
disgust|I guess hunting down ghouls like wild animals is okay. I mean, they're probably going to die anyways, right boss?
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|Hmmm. Well... Vegas burns brighter than most cities West of the Divide, and that glitter has its appeal.
neutral|The NCR Embassy is the headquarters for the NCR on the Strip. The Ambassador and his offices are there as well as the MP headquarters.
anger|All stitched up.
neutral|Like I said, baby, all Benny needs is a Stealth Boy and a Bobby Pin.
joy|Tell them they'll be allowed to continue practicing their dietary habits without interruption. They can eat a portion of what they conquer.
neutral|They died in the same battle trying to hold off the NCR from... something. I don't remember what it was. Guess it seemed important at the time.
neutral|You... you did? That's pretty amazing - I figured you'd need artillery to take him out.
neutral|Side arm in hand, he journeyed back to California in search of the NCR officer who had led the attack on Bitter Springs.
neutral|They don't look like much, but they earn a pretty good living by selling scrap and salvage.
neutral|In Ranger school, they teach you how to spot a liar. I don't know why you're lying, but have it your way. We'll protect this town or die trying.
neutral|Your loss, my friend.
neutral|Hmm?
joy|I lived there for a long time. Kept to myself, didn't get into any fights - hell, the only reason I even kept my guns oiled was professional pride.
neutral|This doesn't feel quite right, but it resolves things and gets my troopers back in one piece.
neutral|I refuse to put my people at risk. If the NCR are pushed out, the raiders and other scum will run amok.
fear|Maybe not. Maybe the new guy is just a clever raider chief with a knowledge of history.
neutral|Need a medic.
neutral|Well that's nothing to be ashamed of. We all have money troubles from time to time.
anger|Gotta spare gun handy?
neutral|Vacate the premises immediately. All Securitrons are at a state of high alert.
anger|Grandma's feeling much better now.
neutral|They're just new money, sugar. They might pretend they're sophisticated, but between you and me, they're not far off from tribals.
neutral|Just to make this clear, I can only spin a whopper this big once. There's only so much people will believe before they see through the bullshit.
anger|In Nipton? Hell no. Town was a shithole, asking to be burned. Just not by Legion. Nobody deserves that.
neutral|Folks here aren't friendly to anyone.
neutral|Ha-ha! Stupid human!
disgust|Okay, boss. When you feel like availing yourself of my centuries of experience, you know where I'll be.
neutral|Though his regrets remained in his thoughts, they coalesced into a purpose, and Boone embraced it.
neutral|Like everything the Master took a direct hand in, they were better than the ones who came later, the ones made by accident.
anger|So if you came here for work, my advice? Go find the Crimson Caravan branch, south of Vegas. They can help you out.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Could you repeat it?
neutral|He's got a lot of pull with Nightkin, though. He talks, they listen. Was hoping he could draw other Nightkin to Jacobstown.
neutral|It is a place of light and healing, and I know in my soul that my flock will be safe there.
neutral|It's almost like I never said anything at all.
sadness|Misdirection's what's saved me all these years. It's what saved us at Hoover Dam. But it's been five years now and Caesar's right across that lake.
neutral|You did? Wow, that's great!
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|And if you had, you know, a huge killer robot at your command, yeah, that would just clutter things up.
neutral|So get on the bed already. I got something to show you.
neutral|I believe Cass frequents the Mojave Outpost, far south of here, near the California border.
neutral|The Courier, a mercenary at heart, helped the Legion achieve victory at Hoover Dam.
neutral|Veronica's a special case. She handles the procurement of supplies. If we didn't let her and those like her back in, we'd all starve.
neutral|You've got yourself a deal. I'll let the townsfolk know some ill-tempered goon has been spreading nasty rumors about you.
neutral|Fine by me. Have you found them yet?
neutral|This is not a good time to be dependent on energy from Hoover Dam. When the Legion attacks, the NCR may cut power altogether.
neutral|Okay, I'll reassure the townies your intentions are good, but if you keep it up, they aren't going to believe me in the future.
anger|Boss, usually when somebody gives you a name and nothing else, it's because that's all they want to give you.
neutral|You sure you know what you're doing?
neutral|It's probably more important that you get out of here alive. If you haven't noticed, there's a battle going on here.
neutral|Well they gotta go, or this'll be a ghost town before long.
neutral|But maybe dumb machines like me ought to get blown up and scrapped for salvage. Who knows? Not me!
neutral|Isn't that sweet of you to fret about me? Such a good boy. I can always help you stay hidden from the bad people so you won't get in trouble.
neutral|Saddened by the loss of life and liberty in the area, Arcade left the Mojave Wasteland for parts unknown. He was never heard from again.
neutral|I wish someone with your medical training had come along sooner. I think she'll actually stick with her treatment because of what you said.
neutral|Accusing the Kings of lying with a foreign invader for their newfound ties to the NCR, Mr. House punished them by ordering their forced removal.
neutral|I've never really done much science stuff until now. I'm pretty good at it, or so Doctor Henry tells me.
neutral|Allow me to introduce myself! I'm the Securitron that dug you up in the bone orchard outside Goodsprings.
neutral|Will the medical wonders of the post-apocalyptic world never cease?
surprise|Cyber-dog? Like the ones I've seen up in Denver? I know what you're talking about, and it would make Lupa immortal in a way.
neutral|Their standard kit seems to be a blade of some sort and light armor. Guns are not uncommon, but are of questionable condition.
neutral|Hey yourself, kiddo.
neutral|This is bullshit! Why are we even talking about dealing with these guys?
disgust|Right, because a ghoul in a vaquero outfit is really going to blend in with the scenery.
neutral|Whatever you say!
neutral|The leader was a New Vegas-type, typical city boy. He had a bunch of Great Khans with him, probably hired guns.
anger|Still, not like I'm going anywhere. Caravan title's still keeping me here, even though it's dead and gone.
neutral|He shuts himself back inside the closet and that's when I see the grenade he's left by my feet.
neutral|It's a beastly place. Poverty is rampant, and all that goes with it - drugs, alcohol abuse, the usual.
joy|So now the men have to answer to Brigadier General Moore, and both they and I have you to thank for it.
fear|Testing our luck coming back here.
neutral|Radio signal out here can be pretty spotty because of all the hills. Sometimes our scheduled updates don't go through.
neutral|<Coughing Fit>
joy|Oh, it's cool, man. Diane passed me the haps on that fandango with Anders. I got your back.
neutral|...There, I think you've got the hang of it now. You should be able to use any type of power armor you come across using what you just learned.
sadness|I'm not going to pout and cry if you give him to the Brotherhood. I'd rather they have it than allow all that knowledge to disappear.
anger|No call for that.
neutral|Had to try. Smoke trail's getting thicker by the hour - wish Jackson could spare some men.
neutral|Also, you need any gear checked, we can get you up and running again... once you fill out the work orders, and sign for the parts, of course.
neutral|We wish to escape the barbarity of the wasteland, especially the violence and bigotry of its human inhabitants.
sadness|Vulpes... brought the touch of Caesar to such places.
neutral|Weapon's busted.
neutral|Dermot saves his money. Saint James spends his on Sweetie. A good customer, that one.
neutral|Uh... no. No. They're gonna think I'm having trouble letting go. They're good soldiers. I don't give them enough credit.
neutral|And if you see a squad of the veterans - guys who earned their black armor... well... you won't find a more beautiful sight.
fear|No guards in the towers, not a good sign.
neutral|We already experience regular supply shortages. Opening our door to the entire region... I don't see how this could ever work.
sadness|Yeah... yeah, I am. Never realized had all that anger in me. Makes me wonder how much more I can settle with bullets.
neutral|Take it.
neutral|It's strange that he would ask you to find mission discs on them, however. The missing paladins were all on standard patrols, which don't need them.
neutral|We are preparing to move against the Dam, and Legate Lanius has a part for you to play in the battle. Report to him at his camp.
neutral|Step closer to the demonstration area, please!
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
anger|NCR troops control Hoover Dam. Why do they need more power?
neutral|Sometimes it seems like I spent the better portion of my youth in that old wreck of a building.
anger|Fine, ignore me. Just don't ask me to re-attach your arm when your pet murder machine goes into "search and destroy" mode.
anger|Kings told me I couldn't deal water here, fuckers. They like having mono. As in monopoly.
disgust|If all NCR believes as you do, then this battle is already won.
neutral|I hope they do, but I haven't heard nothing.
neutral|Spoken like a chump. A King doesn't have to grovel before others to get paid. Anyway, I've got better things to do than shoot the shit with you.
fear|Well, a deputy isn't much good without a sheriff. So I figured I'd come in here and protect these good people until someone finds us a new one.
joy|Oh, so you have heard of me. Yeah, that's right. I was the big draw at the Shark Club, people used to pay hundreds of caps to see me.
anger|Never thought I'd go out like this....
neutral|The Courier, fair and kind-hearted to those in the Wasteland, ensured that Mr. House would keep New Vegas stable and secure for future generations.
neutral|Ohh... that was a bad one, wasn't it, Leo?
neutral|Citizens of the NCR were favorite targets, and they always suffered the worst fates.
anger|Once I'm done with you, I'll talk them out of this stupid plan. You've opened some old wounds - it's only fair I return the favor.
neutral|Sure do. Saint James is my number one customer. He's a prospector who pays Marco to stay here at the Casa week to week.
neutral|Good riddance to it is all I have to say. Never liked having it around.
neutral|But, in the end, Rex finally succumbed to the horrors of the wasteland.
neutral|I had them on my monitors the whole time. I almost headed out there when they got surrounded by those scorpions, but Watkins is a hell of a shot.
neutral|Oh, b-b-because of what that fuck Cook-Cook did? W-well, it's n-not the same thing, but D-Doc Usanagi helped me with my s-s-stuttering.
neutral|No, nothing wrong at all. By all means, carry on.
neutral|Strike? That's how we got into this problem in the first place. We can't beat these armies.
anger|He's a story to frighten the younger Legionaries. He's dead - no man, no matter how tough, could survive a fall into the Grand Canyon.
neutral|With Lanius at the head of the Legion, however, I doubt he'll have much use for my services. He prefers... direct methods.
neutral|Done.
neutral|For what it's worth, I appreciate you didn't shed any more blood. We need to save our strength for the Legion.
neutral|That barbarians with such crude weapons could crush a foe that defeated us is food for much thought.
neutral|I've already got a decent amount saved up. If I keep it up, there's no reason I shouldn't be able to go start over somewhere else soon.
neutral|Old World had cars that ran on roads like these above the ground, 'cept they didn't go anywhere.
neutral|I guess you could say we don't have law so much as consequences.
neutral|And the Crimson Caravan and the Van Graffs have their heart back West. Not sure it'll do any good, though.
neutral|Beats Freeside.
joy|By the time the veterans got to the ridge, we were already in Boulder City.
anger|You're not getting started off on the right foot here. The NCR still has a strong presence here and can make your stay unpleasant.
neutral|The Fiends staged an attack against Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
neutral|The Boomers defended themselves against many attacks from the Legion, but they eventually fell to the Legion's superior numbers.
neutral|Yeah, all right. If McLafferty complains long enough, my folks might haul me back to California just to shut her up. Tell the old hag I'm gone.
neutral|Great! So I've been looking over Mr. House's force projections and running some calculations...
neutral|The data on that Platinum Chip is a big secret, unless you can find a dedicated reader to decode it. Isn't that frustrating?
disgust|Psh. Whatever.
neutral|I don't really have much to do with them. They seem to have an aversion to weapons technology, and those who possess a great deal of it.
neutral|I knew all that. Pretty smart, huh?
neutral|Okay, but if I find you messing with it again, there'll be hell to pay, you hear me?
neutral|Heading to the hills with his rifle, he began a deadly campaign against high-ranking Legion officers.
neutral|Unless you dipped that in cheese fondue, I'd say it's infected. Let me fix that up for you.
neutral|I was good at it too, but after a while I just felt like a piece of meat and had to quit.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|What do I look like? Arm candy? I don't think so, friend.
neutral|What we need, more than anything, is bodies.
neutral|Centaurs eat humans, Rhonda! You see, humans are a lot smaller, and much more tender than you or I, so centaurs naturally see them as food.
neutral|Sure. The outside looks okay, but I think something broke on the inside.
neutral|A great warrior. When he was but a recruit, I watched him kill ten men in the arena with his bare hands.
neutral|That's a shame. Well, come back when you do.
neutral|Anyway, I've got things to do. Later, Simon.
anger|Enough.
neutral|Good idea.
surprise|Oh. Uh... well, yeah, I can do that. Um, thanks.
neutral|Well, I never.
joy|As for wisdom... there is wisdom in your words, man of the West.
neutral|Carlitos, huh? Yeah, I do. Try the diner, but don't start any trouble, you hear?
neutral|
neutral|Guess he wants to do this the hard way, boys. Take him down.
neutral|You may want to try Old Mormon Fort in Freeside. They should have a doctor on duty.
neutral|The Kings retained their control of Freeside, and while they continued to favor the needs of locals, they tolerated the citizens of the defeated NCR.
neutral|Best of luck to you.
neutral|While the NCR made repeated entreaties that Freeside join the Republic, the Kings steadfastly maintained their independence.
neutral|It ain't much to look at, but this dump has something that even the Strip doesn't, and that's absolute freedom.
neutral|An outsider! In the bunker!
joy|When you set your mind to something, you get results. I like that.
neutral|A little bit ago the convicts there staged a coup, killed the guards that weren't able to escape, and have been ransacking the area since then.
neutral|Should hit the Big Horn saloon here.
anger|What? No! I thought you were supposed to be here to help, and here you are making accusations.
neutral|I was thinking of taking a walk a little later.
joy|And we're glad to have you - and whether you're a soldier of the Republic or not, you're it in my eyes.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|Ahh....
neutral|The Securitron was disabled somehow. Might have been an EMP, given some of the damage I saw.
anger|I can't believe I'm about to do this, boss. If I buy it out there, I want twelve mariachi bands playing at my funeral. A medal might be nice, too.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
fear|Yeah. That's what I thought, too.
neutral|Good doing business - enjoy Wind-Brahmin.
neutral|In what currency would you like your payout? Non-caps currencies will have fractions paid out in caps.
neutral|<whimper>
anger|Only because everyone would be conscripted or enslaved. And the people who are unfit for military service or slavery would be put down. Swell plan.
neutral|It's scrambling all the terminals here at the moment. Luckily, we only use this section for storing historical data.
neutral|When you find them, tell them you're my representative and ask them if the bears are still hunting. That should get them to talk to you.
neutral|If you like things dangerous, just past the Wrangler is the Silver Rush, where the Van Graff family peddles their weapons.
neutral|Sure thing. Have a look.
joy|Please do not struggle, General Oliver, you might hurt yourself. You can relax presently.
neutral|Well, to be honest with you, I don't really know them two as well as I might.
neutral|Ah, new to the hunt, are you? Well listen carefully, as ol' Festus don't like to repeat himself.
neutral|He was looking to try and get troops to clear the north road. You can find him over in the other building - the one without a bar.
neutral|Though the Courier snatched victory from NCR, only General Oliver was blamed for the loss of Hoover Dam.
neutral|I had nothing to do with that, and neither did anyone here. Now where would you have gotten an idea like that?
neutral|Why, then, do you keep asking?
neutral|Give this to the Elder. My observations are all within. Perhaps he will have a better idea of what this situation portends.
neutral|We lost a lot of men and women, but we broke through and made it here. Make no mistake, McNamara saved this chapter that day.
anger|There are other ways to punish people, other ways to condemn their actions.
surprise|First time I seen a fence made out of artillery.
neutral|Later.
neutral|Done.
neutral|The fine proprietors of Mick & Ralph's appreciate that kind of attitude, and would like to offer you a discount on their fine wares.
neutral|Makes the stroll a bit more leisurely.
neutral|I may not be the one to help stop him here, but you are. Fortis fortuna adiuvat. Good luck, and good bye.
neutral|Don't judge him too harshly for trying to get some caps out of you. He probably took you for a squatter, looking for a place to settle down.
neutral|It's just a rumor. Even so, I trust you will refrain from bringing up this subject again.
neutral|Let me know when you've decided.
joy|Don't worry. Not much bite left in this old dog.
neutral|All right! I can give you some of my extra leather armor and spare ammo. Just don't hurt anybody if you don't have to, all right?
neutral|You've cleaned that vermin's nest? Gotta say, we don't see that kind of attitude around here. Good work!
neutral|I know the NCR has troops near Primm, so talk to the locals and find out if any of those troops are going to be coming our way.
neutral|I can't let you play here anymore.
neutral|Well, they unloaded what they had left on the Dino Bite as a tax write-off. But that was before my time.
sadness|I was born just outside Mexico City. My family had a little ranch there. After they died, I took my little sister, my Rafaela, to Mexico City.
neutral|Really? An army of Securitrons - upgraded, no less? What a development!
neutral|Sorry, but I can't risk exposing the tribe to more savage outsiders.
sadness|My father died when I was young and I never got over it. Oh... and I like medicine and reading books about failed Pre-War socioeconomic policies.
neutral|But an exception was made in his case, on account of him being a genius. Unfortunately, whatever scientific acumen he had didn't extend to tactics.
neutral|Perhaps it's time for a new strategy. Go to the NCR commander and tell her the Brotherhood is willing to put aside our enmity for the time being.
neutral|Absent a firm solution, Veronica's expression of frustration with Brotherhood leadership would lead to her banishment.
neutral|I'm not really much of a historian. The short version is that the Rangers are the elite of the NCR military. Best fighters in the wasteland.
joy|Only lottery that matters! Oh my God smell that air!
neutral|That accounts for all the tribes you needed to get to know!
neutral|We'd be the last to know.
neutral|A bunch of people would be willing to side with the Legion to not have to worry about Fiends and Boomers and Powder Ganger attacks.
sadness|It's unfortunate that the language is now associated with the gentlemen across the river.
neutral|I know life as a salvager can't compare to being a vertibird pilot but... at least it's life. That has to count for something.
sadness|He reminds me of me in some ways.
joy|Course not. You earned it - rest up, let us carry things for a while.
neutral|He wasn't able to be a ranger after that, but his eyes are still sharp so I had him transferred to First Recon.
neutral|Hahaha! I know that's not true, because you still have a head!
sadness|My story's a long one, friend, and I can't say as it's all that interesting.
neutral|'Til then, we'll man the towers and keep an eye on the Fiends. We've had more than our share of trouble from their direction.
surprise|What? Was it something I said?
neutral|
anger|Considering how long we've been here, we know it well. We've patched this place up plenty - we'll get it running again.
sadness|When the NCR learned that Enclave personnel had integrated, we kept moving to the fringes. It's one of the reasons why I wound up out here.
neutral|With little law left in the wasteland, the Boomers continued to defend themselves against the prospectors and scavengers invading their territory.
sadness|And that, boss, is all she wrote.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
joy|The Gun Runners have been putting rapid-fire death-dealing in the hands of anyone who needed to defend himself for over a century.
neutral|All right, I'll watch it.
neutral|Special guest star Best Friend Tabitha is with us in the studio to share her insights on this topic that affects us all.
joy|Heck, I get confused and I've been doing this for a long time now. What he - or she - sees as a problem might be standard operating procedure.
anger|If you plan to help Caesar's Legion, this is going to be a brief relationship.
neutral|The strain of defending Las Vegas from annhilation exceeded my power systems' capacity. My primary reactor shut down.
neutral|Beagle had some notes he was taking while he was eavesdropping around the Powder Gangsters. He'll be your best source of information on that subject.
neutral|The voice on the radio belongs to Tabitha, the "supreme commander" of Black Mountain - or, as she calls it, the "State of Utobitha."
neutral|Done. Running slideshow now.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
disgust|Most of the folks around the Boneyard haven't been to New Vegas and probably never will.
neutral|Now those tough-looking fellows must be Great Khans. I recognize those funny helmets and leather vests from stories I've heard...
neutral|Those orders naturally include shooting humans on sight. Or pounding them with whatever happens to be handy. Guns being in short supply, you see.
neutral|For their dishonorable conduct, the NCR court-martialed and executed them by firing squad.
neutral|Do not make me regret this decision, outsider.
neutral|No! Stay away from me!
anger|I said, let me get to my chair.
neutral|I killed Corporal White to protect Westside's self-reliance. It was rash, and I regret it now.
anger|Need something with more kick.
neutral|Think you can take down another one of these scumbags? Up to you. But I can trust you to do the job, and I'd hate to see you walk away.
neutral|Done.
disgust|"It's the company?" That has got to be the biggest load of Brahmin shit I've ever heard.
neutral|All right, now for some ass-kicking.
neutral|While your actions up to this point have been commendable, I'm afraid they don't quite qualify as such a service.
neutral|I... would, perhaps some other time. When my orders take me to Vegas, perhaps. Wish things were different, but might take some time.
disgust|Our roads into NCR are hung with the bodies of those who attempted to negotiate with us.
neutral|I can't imagine what went on. Dusty can probably tell you more about it.
neutral|There's a captured NCR trooper available - Sergeant Andrews. He's already been challenged once and survived, so he should be a worthy opponent.
neutral|I don't know, seems to be a lot of attention on Nipton. Word is, one of the snipers in the nest on the roof spotted smoke from the East.
neutral|Goodsprings saw more trade along I-15 after NCR gained control of the Mojave Wasteland, but with that came a heavy burden of the Republic's taxes.
neutral|All right then, I already got a head start, but I'll go first anyway.
neutral|This concludes our firing test of the ARCHIMEDES I and II laser systems. Thank you for observing Poseidon Energy safety protocol. Have a nice day.
neutral|The General's "accident" was unfortunate... with Kimball dead, the angry Californian public could've used an alternate scapegoat to pillory...
neutral|Still, their demonic presence brought all progress towards the Great Journey to a standstill.
neutral|Yeah, sounds cool.
neutral|We're stretched thin and the Long 15 just keeps getting longer. Slow to get supplies. Slower to get reinforcements.
neutral|There's a Doctor Usanagi who's supposed to be good at this sort of thing.
neutral|
neutral|Sure. I can help you out.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|Lot of bad blood between Super Mutants and humans. Goes back years. Some here still got the scars and memories.
neutral|Anyway, what did you bring me?
neutral|Listen - I don't want you getting killed for this, so if you head there and run into trouble, I'm asking for eyes and ears, not your life. All right?
neutral|What'll fight on Blue?
disgust|Not even a little bit, no.
joy|Here you go.
neutral|Then I guess you won't be getting on me, either. Improve your prospects and come back, sugar. I'll be waiting.
disgust|No shit, you washed-out old fuckup, I didn't need a Brotherhood Scribe to tell me that.
neutral|Please, wanderer, bear in mind that every feral ghoul you spare now is one that we can save later.
joy|And now that I've been traveling with you for a while, you've made me realize that I can still do that.
neutral|<Gasps> For me? Do you mean it? No, no, it's too much! Well, okay. But it's too much! It's perfect. Thank you. Thank you.
neutral|All right, but put everything back the way you found it!
neutral|No amount of caps will ever repay what the NCR robbed from me.
anger|Do you think the Gun Runners keep the NCR military supplied by carrying weapons and ammo from the Boneyard out here by the armload?
anger|The Brotherhood seems to have formed not long after the great atomic war. It's hard to know - they care little for history.
neutral|Ordinarily I'd take your word on that, but lately I've had several people lie and claim to be citizens just to take advantage of our program.
neutral|Didn't really think I'd do it, but as long as the tubby bastard was actually alive, I could pretend like I would.
neutral|Okay.
neutral|Anyway, occurred to me I could scratch the traveling itch and get paid for it. Cassidy Caravans formed around me, rest is history.
neutral|Thank you, Rhonda. As you know, one of the many benefits of living in Utobitha is the ready availability of pet centaurs.
neutral|Talk to Mrs. Hostetler. She's near the Crimson Caravan. I think her daughter's making bad "friends," the kind that'll slit your throat in the dark.
neutral|All right, if you poke around the Van Graffs and Alice, fine.
neutral|Now go, and teach the Mojave Outpost what you've learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
anger|But if I see either one, go into their camp? I'm going to start shooting, no matter what you find.
anger|I went after Dave and his brothers. They had a head start, but they slept nights. I didn't. Took me three days to catch up to them.
fear|Holy shit! Run for your lives!
neutral|Mags was finally promoted to Sergeant, and the rest of the Misfits received an official commendation.
anger|That does not mean we would not succeed.
neutral|Whiskey and me are old friends, keeps me going when times get rough. Like now.
neutral|The station's been silent for quite some time now... I guess this confirms what we've all feared. Thanks for letting me know.
neutral|Ooh, I love the centaurs. They're just so cute!
anger|If someone is saying I filed that report, that's a load of crap. I won't have my name attached to a clerical error.
neutral|and his army of rehabilitated tribals and police robots.
neutral|Don't mistake that for coward talk, though. We're a town of survivors, and we'll fight tooth and nail if pushed, but we don't go looking for trouble.
neutral|Can do.
neutral|Knights also get to go out on patrols, scouting assignments, and support the Paladins in offensive operations.
neutral|Deputy Beagle would have been your best bet, before he met that tragic end.
neutral|<bark!>
neutral|Then you die.
anger|You fink! Murdering me like this, down on my knees?
neutral|I am Jason Bright, the prophet of the Great Journey. All the ghouls you see here are members of my flock.
neutral|Lily continued to take her medicine at half-doses, and although she remembered her grandchildren, her mind remained muddled and confused.
sadness|If you can find a way to push Mr. House out of the picture as well, I think everyone will be better off.
neutral|Let's just say that people around here talk about you. They say things, not nice things. We only like to hear nice things, get it?
neutral|Driven mad by Caesar's victory at Hoover Dam, and unable to escape his memories, Boone staged a suicide mission against the Legate.
neutral|You son of a bitch!
anger|We shall see how brave you are when nailed to the walls of Hoover Dam, your body facing West so you may watch your world die.
joy|Always happy to repeat myself for you, boss.
neutral|Still, if you got more like that...
neutral|There's no real equivalent to them in the NCR. Centurions are battle-born, elite officers who earned their rank with blood and sweat.
neutral|Huh? Hey, I think you dropped your gun there. Here. Here you go. Just don't point it at me, okay?
neutral|More like he's going to the Wrangler for another drink. You watch.
anger|I headed up into Tuscon and lived there as Old Miguel for a while. Things were okay, then they got bad, and I headed west to the Mojave.
neutral|Ugh. Maybe I should have stayed back in NCR after all.
neutral|Thursday! Wait... ugh. Dammit.
neutral|Normally, that would have fallen under my jurisdiction, but the Elder thought it'd provide a good test for you, so I backed off.
neutral|I should've known that the caps were too good to be true, but there was still no way I could pass up the chance.
neutral|That wicked old Master got what was coming to him, that's what! After his cathedral blew up, I decided it was high time to go home.
neutral|But he's probably saved more lives than I ever will.
neutral|So, you're the outsider that's been given leave to wander around freely. Desperate times call for desperate measures, I guess.
neutral|Oh, I know it says "school" out front, but everything in here seems to be related to the worship of some guy from back in the day.
neutral|But across the Colorado, another society had arisen, under a different flag.
neutral|Wow. Whatever you have planned must be pretty big to give them the boot, but this sounds dangerous.
joy|I'm here to make sure the bunker stays in one piece.
neutral|I could pay you.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Old Mormon Fort became excessively burdened by the influx of patients, struggling to provide even the most basic of services.
neutral|After two tries, I think I've learned enough. I'm sure there's something more promising I could be helping the other Followers with.
fear|Actually, I'm going to keep talking anyway. Sorry, but I really need to get this out.
neutral|See, I thought the bounty hunting trade would be easy money, but it turns out it's hard work. So screw it.
neutral|Screw it. Just shoot! They'll get the hint!
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|Well, ain't we all, right? That was a long time ago. I don't pay it much mind anymore.
anger|NCR tries. It's just that trying doesn't mean a whole lot when you're paying your respects to the dead.
neutral|She keeps tabs on caravan traffic in the Mojave, wouldn't put it past her to keep track of Cassidy Caravans and its owner.
neutral|He was furious. Called it "children playing with a bomb." But he was mad because we'd lost its power. What we'd use it for... he didn't even care.
anger|That's one way to look at it.
neutral|Primm? Hayes' unit is stationed up there, were having problems with some of the NCRCF convicts. What can I help you with?
anger|Little help here, boss?
neutral|You already brought me the thrust control modules, so all that's needed now is three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
neutral|It's like I told you. Dhatri's not my real father. He just looked after me for a while.
neutral|Shoot.
neutral|Well done. It will be very useful in the coming battle against the snipers the NCR will no doubt have hidden in the hills near the Dam.
anger|Next thing I know, I'm squatting in "their" land. Never mind that I'd already been living here for years.
joy|I'll have my guards take him captive. If he cures my condition, I'll see to it that your reward is several times his value.
fear|I mean... but, we study all sorts of science and technology so, you know, we... you just kind of get familiar with them. Yeah.
neutral|I wasn't expecting a resupply so soon, so you have anything from Red Rock Canyon to sell me?
joy|I know your look, you probably say all the right things... so we're clear, nothing's going to happen between us. You'd best respect that.
neutral|Stay safe.
neutral|Oh, well if you change your mind let me know. I have some parts here I can use to upgrade his armor if you leave it with me for a bit.
neutral|Check that out! She just left the Lucky 38!
joy|Vegas will be a shining jewel in the middle of the desert, an oasis of light, a beacon to show mankind the way to the stars.
neutral|Keep your nose to the ground, stranger, that's what. Mind your own business and let us mind our own, are we clear?
disgust|But the depths of their moral sickness, their dissolution? Nipton serves as the perfect object lesson.
neutral|Did you know that the first battle at Hoover Dam was won because of the Rangers? Legion had the numbers, but we had the skill.
neutral|Actually, it sort of fell on me. My feet get antsy if I stay in one place, like the Mojave Outpost.
neutral|That's a sensible notion. Your familiarity with the nearby terrain makes you perfect as a liason.
fear|That wig is going to haunt my nightmares. Seriously.
disgust|The supplier, a guy in Primm named Tyrone, is a cheating son of a bitch who won't deliver even though he's already been paid in advance.
neutral|No thank you. Good luck with your, uh, "ambush."
neutral|Oh, and Crenshaw should be dead before you report him. Don't leave any chance for him to deny the bombings. Let's say he pulled a gun on you.
joy|You handled that well.
disgust|Sorry. I assumed the only reason you'd fight past a horde of Super mutants and pick the lock on my cell is if you heard my cry for help on the radio.
neutral|The weirdest one has to be the Great Khans and their trained Deathclaws at Foxtrot. These reports can't be accurate. Can they?
neutral|Well! I think we've all learned something today. Let's go to music!
neutral|He ensured Mr. House's tyranny was broken and neither Caesar's Legion nor NCR would ever gain control over New Vegas.
neutral|You live ten years in Caesar's army, you're a force to be reckoned with.
neutral|He tells me to do things, terrible things, and sometimes the medicine isn't enough to keep him quiet!
neutral|His mind had difficulty adjusting, but Rex eventually found peace with his new, more vicious self.
neutral|Help me clean this up. No one's going to want to shop here with a corpse out front.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|As for the price for this favor, 700 caps sounds about right. Rey's like family, and I've got other dogs to take care of.
neutral|There was some sort of trouble involving the water supply recently, but it sorted itself out, as these things often do.
neutral|Fearing for the safety of anyone she associated with, she continued her solitary life as a scavenger.
neutral|Don't tell them where we're from - or headed.
neutral|One night, there was a big explosion from the other cell block. I had no idea what was going on, so I took cover in my bunk.
neutral|I've come across numerous inconsistencies between our numbers and our reports - especially with regards to intercepting hostiles.
neutral|I still don't think he'd like it if I let you in there.
neutral|Need a new weapon.
neutral|Right. Fine then, last question -  What animal is on the NCR's flag - a two-headed bear, an eagle, a two-headed snake, or a two-tailed lion?
neutral|I'll fight for it again today. If you're looking to convince me otherwise, you better have a lot more reasons than you just telling me to go.
neutral|Best prices around so long as you don't try putting anything someplace it was never intended. How's that sound?
neutral|A deal's a deal. We'll be on our way.
neutral|Only you may enter. Tell your companion to wait and speak to me again.
neutral|We should check the wagon, they may not have got everything.
neutral|<whimper>
fear|Holy shit! Run for your lives!
anger|I will overlook this error, but only because I think you can still be useful.
neutral|There's always something interesting going on, but the biggest news has to be the coming dustup between the NCR and the Legion over the Dam.
neutral|Our titanium alloy housing does a good job of protecting our delicate electronic insides from small arms fire and shrapnel!
neutral|This is Sloan, a camp for us quarry workers. The actual quarry, Quarry Junction, is up the road north of here. The whole thing is an NCR operation.
neutral|Thank you, Colonel Moore. And thank you, my fellow Californians, who have come so far to answer the call to service put forth by the republic.
neutral|Place sets geiger counters ticking.
neutral|As the Battle of Hoover Dam ended, Boone confirmed what he had always suspected - that revenge would never quiet his troubled mind.
sadness|Unlike Mr. House, refugees in New Vegas don't have the luxury of constant medical care. Some of them don't even have regular access to clean water.
neutral|All together, this software upgrade confers a 235% increase in combat effectiveness - per unit!
neutral|Just head over to the REPCONN test site west of here. See if you can get the ghouls out of there.
neutral|About five years now. I have family back in Arroyo, but this is where all of the good work is being done, so to speak.
neutral|Much as anyone else. Cazador trap - you fly in, the city sucks a pint out of you, then you're out on the street.
neutral|That's supposed to be Driver Nephi? The head's in really bad shape, so a full reward is out of the question.
neutral|Ooo. Got any juicy gossip?
neutral|But reports would emerge from Mojave scientists and social workers of old equipment miraculously repaired and research notes mysteriously completed.
neutral|This unfortunate circumstance will prevent us from immediately using their blueprints to manufacture weapons. A pity.
neutral|Oh yeah, dumb-dumbs are the most common type of mutant that most travelers will encounter, and make up more than half the mutants here in Utobitha.
neutral|We go back and forth a couple of times until either he talks or he can't move his jaw anymore. Either way we've had our entertainment for the day.
neutral|What'd I miss?
neutral|You know you'll be back.
neutral|Sure, but how long before the NCR or Caesar's Legion track us down and take it by force anyway?
anger|Actually, you know what, fuck it, I don't want to hear your answer anyway.
neutral|A lot of the scrap you see around here is from REPCONN, even my favorite chair.
neutral|Here, take some of these. And don't tell anyone where you got them.
neutral|It was a difference in philosophy, mostly. "Mercy" was not part of Moreno's vocabulary.
neutral|He killed one of my pack Brahmin simply because it was in his way. I knew better than to complain about it, though.
neutral|Then, we lost the oil rig and shortly after that, the base at Navarro. Nobody left except us Remnants.
neutral|It doesn't look like we're going to be trading with anyone outside of Nellis anytime soon, so I'd rather not bother.
neutral|I've no reason to disclose the purpose of my actions to a stranger. Please leave.
neutral|That sounds fair. And all I have to do is try to tone down the attacks on the Squatters, you say?
neutral|You can play hard-to-get. I understand. I know the game.
neutral|That'll take too long to build up to generate capital - 'course, since you'd have to guard it during that time... don't know, could go either way.
fear|Eventually, my father started turning people away before we ran out of food. Things got violent. My father and I got our guns, and we drove them off.
neutral|All right, if you're here to assist, good, that's what I want to hear.
neutral|Not every day you come back to your gravesite.
surprise|You? Did you re-direct the power stream back to our section?
neutral|Fuck you, NCR thugs! This is our land, and you won't last here forever!
neutral|We use it to hide our patrols and supply runners, though we still send such out at night to be extra safe.
joy|Like I said, you get the juice, we'll cut loose.
neutral|I get so used to sitting in this chair and listening to radio reports, sometimes I forget people are getting ready for a war out there.
neutral|I remember she had an edge about her, like she'd rather be someplace else. This kind of life ain't for everyone, that's for darn sure.
neutral|Benny carries it with him at all times. I think he's paranoid that someone might want to take it from him.
neutral|When they found those threats absent, they turned to the man in charge of the area, but Hsu being Hsu, he denied having anything to do with it.
neutral|Slavers, killers, and all other kinds of trouble. They dress up like Roman soldiers, so there's no mistaking it when you see them.
neutral|With their leader dead, the rest of their army retreated to the east. We've sent scouts to track them, but that's it.
neutral|They wear special outfits, too, pieced together from the armor of all their defeated enemies. Good commanders, tough opponents.
neutral|Another one of Poseidon Energy's many secret weapons projects. Before the Great War. It didn't go anywhere.
neutral|Yeah? On what?
neutral|I got out of that work because it just made me feel empty inside. What makes you think I would ever go back to that degradation?
neutral|Good luck! See you at the dam!
neutral|I'm sorry, but your order won't be in for a while. Please come back in a day or two.
anger|Grandma's weapon broke, and there are still backsides that need paddling!
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|See what you can find in the Town Hall, there might be survivors.
anger|Did he bother to introduce himself, or did he not take you for somebody who'd get up again when killed?
surprise|So you're telling me, I could take this money you're offering, give them nothing, and then go on to strike up another caravan, same as before?
neutral|Cautious after the Boomers' display of power at Hoover Dam, Caesar chose to leave the Boomers alone.
anger|If you're going to be associating with rangers, you'd best stay on their friendly side. With that out of the way, what can I do for you?
neutral|Ain't so pretty, is she? Not since she had a run-in with those Fiends over near McCarran.
neutral|It became clear that the creator had sent him to us, to ensure the success of the Great Journey.
neutral|Hmmph.
neutral|Now are you going to hand over your caps, or am I going to shoot you and take them anyway?
neutral|Keep your guns loaded and ready.
neutral|Then that means I can cast McNamara down for giving those secret orders to my Paladins! Well done! That's exactly what I was looking for!
neutral|The thing of it is, we don't even know what his name was. All the posters just referred to him as "The King".
neutral|When Chris came to us, we tried to convince him that he was human. But this only angered him. He seemed... lost.
anger|I hope we kill 'em all.
neutral|What do you want to know?
neutral|That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
neutral|You still need time to think?
neutral|No... still eating at me, though. Wouldn't mind taking another look. Something's off.
joy|That Loyal guy. He's getting up there in years, but he still finds a way to make himself useful to his people.
surprise|Mitch!? You know "mole-butt?"
anger|About two dozen men came back in the night, after we'd gone to sleep. They set fire to the ranch house and barred the doors from the outside.
neutral|Despite the late Caesar's respect for Chief Hanlon as an adversary, Legate Lanius had Hanlon crucified along with all of the other rangers.
neutral|With no cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia in sight, the disgruntled Nightkin left Jacobstown. Without a treatment, their insanity grew.
neutral|You've already uploaded the new operating system to the Securitrons. All they need is power and they'll be in fighting trim.
neutral|Very well. I'll have him seized and brought to Caesar as his personal physician.
neutral|I just ask that you keep the Brotherhood's interests at heart in all your dealings. Remember that you will always have a home here.
neutral|He's been dead for several years now, but the rumor is that Caesar has scouts out looking for him all the same. The Burned Man was a very tough man.
joy|You're right. You do need a doctor. Lucky I happened along. But first let's discuss my fee...
neutral|Watch your back out there.
neutral|What, you mean like spears? No, none of that. Mom was a tribal, but she didn't teach me anything like that.
neutral|Then allow me to explain our situation. This bunker is currently locked down, allowing no entry or exit, with you being one of the few exceptions.
neutral|Wow, you sound awesome.
neutral|It was by his request, actually. He cleared it with the other Elders. Somehow.
neutral|The Legion is civilization reborn. Our culture is based on virtues such as martial excellence, loyalty, and justice.
neutral|One other thing I forgot to mention - your body may be able to handle only a limited number of implants.
neutral|We Frumentarii are soldiers of a different stripe, capable in battle, but skilled as infiltrators and agents as well.
neutral|A Legion explorer saw Arcade helping locals escape and pointed him out to a Centurion.
neutral|I don't know what they're up to and I don't want to know. I just hope no harm comes to Novac.
neutral|I'm no good without my weapon.
neutral|Okay. Just don't be gone long. I sunburn easily.
neutral|New Vegas continued to be the sole place in the wasteland where fortunes were won and lost in the blink of an eye.
anger|"People" ought to mind their own business.
disgust|With those skinny little arms? Not before the bouncer put two in the back of your head. Now stop being stupid.
anger|Know your place, woman. Unlike the Profligates of the NCR, only men fight in the Legion.
neutral|And because they made the most noble of sacrifices, it did not break us.
neutral|Not a whole gang or anything - just two, maybe three. I was a caravan guard, so I know how to handle a gun pretty well.
neutral|I talked to the cashier at Gomorrah into forwarding me some chips - I was convinced I was due for a hot streak.
neutral|Hey, I've seen you before around our place. You've really fallen on hard times if you're working for these clowns.
neutral|Where do you come from that you haven't heard of the NCR? Nevermind, it doesn't matter much.
neutral|Caesar entered The Strip as though it was his Triumph. The Legion pushed the NCR out of New Vegas entirely, driving them back to the Mojave Outpost.
neutral|I really shouldn't have taken so much pride in how I set that up, huh? I feel really bad right now.
neutral|If the Republics sinkhole-progress doesn't kill us, greed will. Thanks for bringing me this, I know revenge must have been tempting.
sadness|It's no secret that we've had better campaigns. Holding this whole length of river isn't easy.
neutral|If we need something obliterated, Raquel and the howitzer crews are more than qualified.
neutral|Unfortunately, NCR rangers identified his father's armor as Enclave property. He was arrested, tried as a war criminal, and imprisoned indefinitely.
neutral|But it's just one animal each night. They don't take it or carve it up or nothing. Just leave it there, all full of holes.
neutral|As soon as you split Freeside, I'm off. Nothin' too complicated. That said, lead the way, chief.
neutral|Still, a distance had arisen between her and her fellow members that would never be bridged.
neutral|No, no idea. Sorry.
neutral|Mistress Tabitha, we should be heading off. Our journey has been much delayed, but we can catch up if we hurry.  Come along, now.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|All right, then. We'll need a couple ingredients to get started. Gonna want some Xander Root and a Broc Flower.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|Do not make me regret this decision, outsider.
neutral|After the death of Chief Hanlon, the power of NCR's Rangers was broken for years.
neutral|Come back in a few days. I'll put my ear to the ground and hopefully have heard a few more things by then.
sadness|Huh... Yeah. Yeah.
neutral|Smells like deathclaw.
neutral|Nothing's changed. Chavez won't answer to me, but he and his crew operate in my territory. Deal with him.
neutral|Very well, show me what you've brought so that I can analyze its potential.
neutral|Ah, I get you. So you think because of my past escort work, I'd be interested in that kind of thing?
neutral|As if they'd even talk to you. You're nobody. I'm Henry-fucking-Jamison.
neutral|I guess I'm lucky that I'm part of the Followers. Helping people as a doctor is important, but with the Followers, it feels different.
fear|Just be careful. If we travel at Caesar's pleasure, he may not let us out as easily as he lets us in.
neutral|Yeah, we do. Here.
neutral|We agreed on 400 caps.
neutral|They both died at HELIOS One. The others were always like a family to me before that, but afterward they became my family in truth.
neutral|It doesn't matter, just grab something. And check on Raul while you're at it.
neutral|Here, take a look at this print-out. It covers all the details!
joy|So you're looking for someone to help, not just tag along? Hnh.
neutral|Because I killed a couple marks for him, that's why. You ever hear of Jackson? Or Night Terror?
disgust|Oh really? Are you going to waste my time again, or do you have something substantive to offer?
neutral|Since Johnson won't be needing his Power Armor, I've decided to let you have it. You'll need training in how to use it, so talk to Moreno about it.
neutral|Even though I believe you would if you had to. You should go tell Private Morales the news. I know she'll be relieved.
joy|Baby, you stick with me, you won't have to work a day in your life. Don't fret about caps, you just sit there and look pretty for me.
neutral|I think maybe it's safer if I don't try.
joy|You're going to rot my teeth, boss. What's left of them, anyways.
neutral|Why, just the other week, one of them offered me a job. Can you imagine? Me, with a real job?
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though.
neutral|Eventually, he left the Mojave and assumed a new name, as he had done so many times before.
neutral|What did you give me, bricks?
sadness|Well, when folks spend their lives in isolation, sometimes that ain't the best of things for learning to fight off germs.
neutral|Other than them, you're better off skipping Freeside entirely and just heading to the Strip.
neutral|That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
neutral|I know where you live Ramos. Open up.
neutral|And a rapid-fire G-28 grenade launching system makes us deadly in close-range engagements! Whoo, look at that!
neutral|Sure, if you want to investigate. It's not like there's anything to steal up there. Just a bunch of old communications equipment.
neutral|Indeed you did. And they seem to be in excellent condition.
neutral|I was just trying to put it all behind me. Find someplace where what I do would actually have some influence.
neutral|But for reasons beyond me, that buffoon Taggart still gets the title. And don't get me started on that little pet of his.
neutral|Really? Unbelievable, man! I knew that wasn't gonna be easy.
joy|Baby, I'm the best thing that ever happened to you. Name's Swank. This here's my joint.
neutral|Independent New Vegas. If that isn't redundant, I don't know what is.
neutral|That ends now. I will undo the wrong I have done my brethren, and lift the lockdown. With luck, we will once again flourish.
anger|Boss, the pain from my wounds is starting to outweigh the pain from my arthritis.
neutral|I've heard stories of that old guy. I'm amazed he's still alive with how much he's been through.
neutral|Under normal circumstances, your story wouldn't make any difference. You'd be dead already.
neutral|<pant pant pant>
sadness|It's not hard for some folks to sell freedom when the alternative is worse. Especially if being with NCR is going to get you on a Legion cross.
neutral|There'd be caps in it for you. I do like to hear what's going on in the world. And that Mr. New Vegas seems like such a gentleman.
disgust|Well, I'm not one for soft living or soft men, let me tell you. Otherwise, I wouldn't be talking to you right now - on both counts.
neutral|I don't mind fighting - especially to protect you, dearie - but I don't like guns. Give me a good chopper, and Leo and I will go right to work!
neutral|Well, I still wouldn't mind going there and crossing my heart a few times, if only to make me feel a bit better.
neutral|Cuts, lacerations, broken bones. Infections resulting from all of the above. Common cold, influenza. Take your pick.
neutral|Marvellous work ethic, bravo.
neutral|As far as she was concerned, the whole thing was proof that playing out a bad hand can pay off in the end...
neutral|After the Courier ensured New Vegas remain free, the Followers found that independent Vegas was even more unstable and violent than before.
neutral|Oh no, I didn't mean that! Who needs their support? The Securitrons will be all the support you need!
neutral|You cheap bastard, like all Mojave people. I'd beat you senseless right now, if we didn't have more important things to do.
neutral|organ rupture,
neutral|Ask away.
anger|Sweet as roses.
neutral|Lead the way.
neutral|Didn't your mother ever tell you it's polite to help an old lady carry her bags?
neutral|The men have been told to toss their weapons over the side of the dam if they receive a fatal wound, but I doubt many will remember.
neutral|Can hear the screaming of rockets and explosions in this place at night.
neutral|You're starting to get quite the reputation around here, aren't you? Don't get me wrong, I'm not passing judgement or anything.
neutral|War. War never changes.
neutral|The dangerous ones are roamers, though there's another group that mostly stays put, over at the prison southwest of here.
anger|And I pity the people that try to take it from us.
neutral|Here, take this lockpicking gear. Your best bet is to wait until late at night find a back door, or catch him by surprise when he's alone.
neutral|That's all right, ma'am. You will someday.
neutral|Report anything you find to me, and we'll move from there.
neutral|I worked in a casino in New Reno, and one of the pit bosses decided he didn't like me. Framed me over some caps, and I ended up in here.
neutral|The NCR did increase their sentences, as they aren't about to take off time for good behavior.
neutral|You better believe it. I'll knock your block off!
neutral|The best of the best, worst of the worst. He came out of NCR, one of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
neutral|I'd really like my beret back, please.
fear|When you're confident you can perform the operation, hurry back. I don't know how long I've got.
neutral|I appreciate the sentiment, but there isn't much you could teach us when it comes to firearms.
neutral|Medical supplies go for a decent amount of caps in the right markets. I figured the quartermaster wouldn't notice any missing. I was wrong.
neutral|After a long and eventful life, Raul's luck finally ran out during his time with the Courier.
neutral|Mr. House is in there, though! It's the central node of his entire network!
anger|Don't have to tell me twice, feel more alive than I ever have.
neutral|Hold on, I've got this.
neutral|We'll leave it under a rock beneath the old windmill. Think of it as a... as a sign of respect.
neutral|<pant pant pant>
neutral|Got any armor with less holes in it for me?
anger|I'm just saying that if it were to fall into Lake Mead and be irreparably damaged... and if you threw an EMP grenade in after it...
neutral|You're still welcome to dine with us, of course. We've just had quite enough of paying you to play our games.
neutral|Oh shit! They saw us. Get out of here, quick!
sadness|I grew up in a place called Hidalgo Ranch just outside Mexico City. It wasn't much, just a bit of farm with a house for three generations of Tejadas.
sadness|I think he left me a gift. Maybe I can use it better than he did.
neutral|See ya soon!
neutral|Watch yourself out there.
neutral|But our two main objectives are still contested. Mr. House controls the Strip and he won't so much as meet with our ambassador.
neutral|The filtration system? He wouldn't have you looking if we didn't need those parts badly, which means that system's in real trouble.
anger|Yeah! Give these Praetorian bums the big send-off, baby!
sadness|Rafaela and I ran. We were pursued by some of the men who attacked our home, but I was always a good shot.
neutral|He may have heard where they were going.
neutral|Place would be beautiful... without the chem addicts and dealers.
neutral|I want you to contact those scouts and gather their reports. Like the patrols, they have devices on them that will enable you to track them.
neutral|I was always the guy who could get things, if you know what I mean. Figured I might as well keep on doing it.
neutral|I have the delightful task of tabulating stockpiles, kill ratios, mission success rates, radiation deaths, and other truly fascinating numbers.
neutral|It's like a Brahmin drive gone wrong - supposed to be a gate north, but you come here, you get caught in the pen. Better to head back home.
disgust|Stake a claim somewhere else, pretty boy.
sadness|Anyway, if you need me, you know where to find me.
neutral|Used to guard Eddie, but not anymore.
surprise|Crazy ass shit.
sadness|They're all right, I suppose. Had a bit of tough going there at the beginning - you know their first town was nearly wiped out by raiders?
neutral|Sure enough, a few grand was missing from the casino vault. I have to assume the bastard stole the funds and figured I was a convenient fall guy.
neutral|Oh, well. I guess it must be coming up on... forty years or so. Back before Elise was chief, anyway. It was a heck of a lot harder then.
neutral|A few years went by, my squad helped take down gangs of raiders here and there, and one day an invitation to join the Rangers arrived.
neutral|During the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, some Kings took it upon themselves to launch several attacks on NCR citizens and soldiers around Freeside.
disgust|I'm thinking that I'm leaving because you are a sociopath. Good riddance.
anger|I may not have all the answers for how to fix Freeside's problems, but Caesar taking control isn't part of the solution. Fair?
sadness|But where is the lamb for this burnt offering?
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|The rest of us just tagged along. Cooke's crew headed north while the rest of us stuck around for payback.
neutral|Excessive ingestion of sarsaparilla can lead to deleterious effects including, but not limited to:
neutral|Screw it. Just shoot! They'll get the hint!
joy|Hmm... this is exactly the kind of symbol the Khans could unite behind.
neutral|All I need now is the igniting agent we discussed earlier.
neutral|There you are! A few of us wanted to thank you for being such a good friend to the Brotherhood, so we've set aside some of our recycled energy cells.
neutral|I've given the order that you be given access to some of the equipment our scouts and patrols have scavenged over the years.
neutral|Caesar honored him with a golden coin, minted in celebration of his contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
neutral|It is, Mistress Tabitha. How I've missed you so. This stranger here fixed me up right as rain. Is she a friend of yours?
anger|They're not just going to roll off into Arizona if we give them a good shove.
neutral|The Great Khans normally stay in their own territory way up northwest, on account of them being enemies with the NCR.
neutral|Yeah, some Pre-War jackass with too much time on his hands apparently decided to inflict his misery on those around him.
neutral|Captain Pappas keeps the law here. Watch out for her, she's no Crocker.
neutral|That's a good question, Rhonda. The truth is, they're so dumb they don't even know that I'm talking about them right now.
neutral|Praise the creator! And bless you, wanderer! The way is clear. I will lead my flock through the basement to the sacred site!
neutral|I'm sure I've got something you'll like.
neutral|I'll tell you whatever I can. Do you have a delivery order you can show me?
neutral|The man outright asked if I had anything radioactive for sale - imagine that! But he paid handsome for that jar of goop.
joy|May not be as fresh as Sweetie or Jimmy, but Pretty Sarah keeps me around for a good reason - experience!
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
joy|A title he earned by extirpating lesser tribes that dared attack NCR citizens. His responses were swift and draconian.
neutral|I'll have to review these in detail, but these reports have given me much to think about. Thank you, outsider.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|We can come to a deal. My price is firm, though - Saint James is a good customer and it better be worth it if I'm going to lose him.
neutral|I could hardly call myself Head Paladin if I didn't. It's one of the first things every initiate learns when they start training. What about it?
neutral|Mortimer told me about you, you know. What a pair of mischief makers you two are!
neutral|You just come on back when you can afford it, and that room's all yours.
neutral|We're the NCR's #1 supplier of weapons and ammunition. You might call us an unofficial branch of the army.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|Yeah.
neutral|The other thing you're going to need is the Platinum Chip. You know, the one Benny killed a courier for, over near Goodsprings?
neutral|During the fight for Hoover Dam, the Brotherhood took HELIOS One, inflicting heavy damage on retreating NCR forces, but it was a pyrrhic victory.
joy|I should get back to work now, see you around.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|Keep telling yourself that, sugar. You'll be back.
neutral|Saint James has problems, that's for sure. Never wants me to say a thing, or for me to move around, either.
joy|Read a book that giant lizards walked the earth like this one - might be a gecko this size.
neutral|Yeah... that's a good idea... no sense making money and waiting for someone to just come and take it, right?
neutral|Done.
anger|That's not an idea to be put in circulation. If mankind's going to survive this moment in history, it needs warriors, not gadgets.
neutral|His head exploded, idiot. Of course it's your fault. Avenge Caesar!
neutral|Did you want to know about anyone else?
neutral|Holding my breath.
neutral|Pretty nice trick, ain't it? Just don't ask me how I do it, because I don't know!
fear|Run!
neutral|Fine by me.
neutral|See you.
neutral|All right, that's a start. But now you have to convince them to support my Legion.
neutral|Done.
neutral|You got one too many by my count.
neutral|It can treat broken bones, cuts, punctures, scrapes. Sometimes I bestow its use upon someone I favor.
disgust|If you're looking for action, jam your dick in a locker and slam it a few times.
neutral|Fair enough. All right, last question - What animal is on the NCR's flag - a two-headed bear, an eagle, a two-headed snake, or a two-tailed lion?
neutral|Show me one, and I'll do him proud.
neutral|Yeah, that's right. Now, get the fuck out of our sight, before we change our minds.
neutral|Oh, I tried. The elder listened patiently to my carefully constructed argument regarding why that buffoon should lose his position.
neutral|I'll still finish what I started with you, though. If you're not afraid, that is. I'll just try not to get too caught up in it all.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Done. Running slideshow now.
neutral|We're here once again with our beloved leader. Best Friend Tabitha, why don't you tell our listeners what you just told me?
neutral|Regrettable, but understandable. Should you change your mind, return here. I will hold off on assigning the task to my brethren, for now.
neutral|If only it were that simple. Think of power armor as a machine to be operated rather than clothing you'd wear.
neutral|Do that. And take care to avoid the valley to the east, if you know what's good for you.
neutral|I don't know. I play all over. I'll never find him!
neutral|Despite NCR's pledge to support Primm, they abandon the town after their loss to the Courier.
neutral|Do whatever Caesar tells you to do. And whenever the opportunity presents, strike at the Profligates. Pile body upon body.
neutral|Can't put the genie back in the bottle, is that it? Maybe you should've thought of that before you conspired to destroy my property.
neutral|It's hard to believe that not too long ago most of the families on the Strip were little more than warring tribes.
sadness|If the Khans are to be immortal, we must make our own destiny. We won't fight for Caesar, but when he strikes, we will ride out one last time.
neutral|Yes, how did it go?
surprise|Well... of course I do.
neutral|
joy|Different people see different things, and sometimes the meaning gets twisted, lost in static from person to person.
anger|So what you're telling me is, you're useless. You have no ability to influence events, so I'm forced to work around your incompetence.
neutral|We have equipment here to treat most physical injuries - lacerations, broken bones, that sort of thing. We also carry a full supply of antitoxins.
anger|My name is Raul Alfonso Tejada.
neutral|Their stuff is outrageously priced, but if you want to shoot something hi-tech, they're the best game in town.
neutral|Do you miss a time when you didn't have to think for yourself, and enjoyed lazy days of following the bellowed commands of others?
joy|I know we couldn't.
anger|That wasn't exactly the response I was hoping for, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
neutral|So... you feel like playing a game?
neutral|Yeah. The man I'm more interested in is Corporal White.
neutral|Oh, pumpkin, grandma's sorry about that. Sometimes she gets mad and listens to Leo when she really shouldn't.
anger|Do you know what you're doing? Making a nation -  like you think you're doing, ain't like chowing down on a pile of Fancy Lad Snack Cakes.
sadness|The name tag said "Miguel," so I started using the name myself. Eventually I made it to Arizona... but that's another story, boss.
neutral|If Ringo doesn't head out on his own, I think we should hand him over. The town shouldn't get itself mixed into the problem.
neutral|That's an old, old principle that's been around since the Brotherhood was founded. It basically means that you have to obey a superior officer.
neutral|Oh. They recruited me... what, a year ago? Taught me to kick even more ass than before. These guys... they really know how to kick some ass.
neutral|Hell if I know. I don't think its serious, but my tinkering days are long gone.
sadness|Feels like other places I've been. Something that isolated from everyday folks starts to take on a bad shine.
neutral|He's a snake, that's why. He owed us the rest of the pay for the job, so maybe he didn't want to pay up.
anger|Shoulda fought naked, it'd hurt less.
neutral|Ralph might be able to forge a pass into the Strip for you, you need one.
neutral|Sure could use a drink.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Fiends would suffer withdrawal and die without the Khans.
neutral|Yeah, that's right. Now, get the fuck out of our sight, before we change our minds.
neutral|If you get both, then let's talk. And... I appreciate you putting yourself at risk like this. Thanks.
neutral|Those ghouls were members of my flock, even after the madness consumed their minds. We never let them wander free.
neutral|
neutral|Come over and introduce yourself.
joy|To me? Well, I'll tell you what I think this squad needs: a little more basic human niceness.
neutral|There'd be things I'd miss - the fun of watching the Kings kick the crap out of a thief, or the look of joy on a child's face after catching a rat.
neutral|Kings are led by the King. Has some kind of robot dog. Guess it hunts robot rats.
neutral|The task I had in mind is still available, if you're up for it.
anger|And maybe you should go jump off Hoover Dam, jackass.
joy|Very good. On occasion it's proven to be more profitable in the long run to simply buy out the competition, and this is one of those occasions.
neutral|Those post office boxes in these old towns still work.
neutral|Some people say that it's a gift. Other people say that it's the kind of thinking anyone could do if they watched more than they talked.
neutral|Didn't you already ask me about this? What the hell for - this place is worthless.
neutral|I bet you would, but Pearl didn't give me permission to sell to outsiders.
neutral|Wow, you're a real people person, aren't you?
neutral|Oh shit! They saw us. Get out of here, quick!
sadness|Feels... I don't know. I guess I feel relieved. I don't know what I feel.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
anger|You know those little lead things that fly really fast and hurt people? I need some.
neutral|Since you put it like that, no. Not unless you know the password. Do you know the password?
neutral|Oh, and I remember seeing a corpse near the rock, too. We never got a chance to check it out since we were too busy fighting for our lives.
neutral|Most of what's in there is junk, but there's this old safe that even Easy Pete wasn't able to crack with dynamite.
neutral|I wouldn't know anything about that, dear. You might ask Johnson.
neutral|The Mojave wasteland, at long last, had entirely fallen under the NCR's banner.
neutral|Looking for weapons, check out Mick and Ralphs... Mick's probably a sight better than Ralph, always trying to talk me out of my pants.
anger|Hey... Hey! Where the hell are you going?Well, fuck you, then!
neutral|Would you mind if I listened to the message?
joy|Oh, you know. Finding alternative treatments for common illnesses and injuries. Stimpaks out of barrel cacti and other fantastic improbabilities.
neutral|Hmm. Unlikely. He was a little too focused on gears and diodes... tech was the cure-all.
neutral|Goodbye.
neutral|Tired of waiting for the world to be done with him, Boone ventured into the wastes to make his own way out.
anger|But I've been to Arizona, boss. Before the Legion, it was a nasty place, so thick with raiders you couldn't trade with a town two miles up the road.
neutral|If you haven't already, see about getting Gorobets and First Recon to help you - they've got things to settle with Driver Nephi, too.
neutral|I don't know. I'm still thinking about what kind of role we could take on that would give us the best chance of survival.
neutral|Sorry, it's against regulation for me to give away NCR supplies to anyone not stationed at this post. Wouldn't want you using it against us.
neutral|There was a hell of a boom over at REPCONN. Looks like the ghouls had some sort of accident with their rockets.
neutral|All right, I'll cross them off the list!
joy|Ahem. Shall we?
neutral|All right! We got all sorts of shit in here. Nice job. Better take some for yourself in case you get hit.
neutral|Where to begin? That you are weak, and we are strong? This much was known already.
neutral|Interested now? All right.
neutral|All right, here we go. First question. Who was the most popular president in NCR history - Peterson, Tibbett, Kimball, or Tandi?
neutral|I don't get as many customers as Sweetie or Maude. But the customers I do get always come back.
neutral|If you'd come to me first, I might have been able to do something. But at this point, my hands are tied. Sorry.
anger|Was driving me crazy, that feeling of being trapped there, so thanks for that.
neutral|Didn't end up mattering. We got sidetracked at HELIOS One and the NCR took the Dam in the meantime. We're still after it, though. In theory.
neutral|Our mission is to recover and preserve the technology of the past, but Elijah wanted more. He sought ways to improve upon technology, make it better.
neutral|I look after the only reasons anyone would want to spend any time here. I'm a pimp.
neutral|Not much of a rumor, but I hear the Tops is always looking for new talent. Lord knows they've needed it for a long time.
neutral|Please don't hurt us no more. I'm begging you.
joy|Excellent. Had you simply killed them, the Omertas would've sent another group after Martina eventually.
neutral|Hey, do me a favor. Trudy - she's the bartender up at the Prospector, kind of the town mom - she likes to meet newcomers.
neutral|The titanium alloy housing that protects its electronic core deflects small arms and shrapnel easily enough...
neutral|Antique rangefinder? I'm trying to think of something that'd be more worthless.
neutral|Was a prospector until I decided to settle here to get away from the NCR. Now I just take it easy and help out with the Brahmin and Bighorners.
neutral|That's it. Except for one thing... thanks.
disgust|Your call.
anger|I say fuck that part. I feel purified, and I love the fact that there's no more loose ends.
neutral|I think there's trouble in Nipton - no traffic from there on the roads, and while I can explain that away, the smoke from the town I can't.
neutral|Don't mention it. It's what I'm here for.
neutral|
neutral|Where to begin? That they are weak, and we are strong? This much was known already.
anger|This was none of their business - or yours. You've got no right to talk to people behind my back about this.
joy|I like to check up on things from time to time. I can't let this place fall apart, now can I?
sadness|He wanted to rebuild the new world in the image of the old. A sad story of good intentions gone bad. In that regard, he's hardly unique.
neutral|Moreover, I've been going over the scouts' reports and keep coming up with the same conclusion. The NCR is not the threat I've believed it to be.
neutral|Whatever suits you.
joy|Hoo-hoo! Hot damn, it's gonna be a party in the camp tonight!
neutral|Ain't that a coincidence! My mind's still hazy on the subject.
sadness|You know what, boss, that's my fault for using sarcasm. No, I haven't seen him. Sounds like a city slicker, though. Might try looking on the Strip.
anger|Grandma's head hurts....
neutral|Doesn't fell like the rest of the Mojave here.
neutral|Be seeing you around.
neutral|All right, that does sound bad. Here, take these - it should be enough. Good luck!
neutral|If you were able to get Ringo out of this mess, you'd have a decent reputation around Goodsprings. I'd even set you up with a discount.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|
neutral|Here's a tip, kid. If you want to get paid, get the job done to completion.
neutral|Place feels like the Sorcerer of Oz sometimes.
surprise|And what would that be?
neutral|The odds of the Californian public supporting a full-scale re-invasion, however, are slight. My Securitrons could beat them, anyway.
anger|Tagged me, need a doctor bag.
neutral|One last thing. Is there any truth to the rumor that all Nightkin are slightly crazy from their overuse of psychologically damaging pre-war tech?
joy|You think so? Well... you're the boss. Okay, I'll give it a try.
neutral|Your guess's as good as mine. Probably better.
neutral|But vital to our cause? Hardly.
neutral|Who's the winner? Oliver Swanick, that's who! Yeah!
neutral|Caesar honored her with a golden coin, minted in celebration of her contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
neutral|Back when we were stationed at HELIOS, our scouts reported that a group was establishing itself in the area as a distributor of Pre-War weapons.
neutral|The demons are invisible. Where one of them stands, the most one sees is the air shimmering, like sunlight on water...
neutral|Me and my hubby, may the man rest in peace, used to scavenge there. If it weren't bolted down, you can bet we took it and sold it.
surprise|And you fell for that? Really? Because I'm going to have you killed now.
neutral|Said there's a courier office here?
neutral|So then they settle at Red Rock Canyon! There's just no getting rid of them!
neutral|Lacking any other skilled medical personnel, the Legion was unable to prevent his death. Caesar mourned his loss for months.
neutral|After Hoover Dam, NCR helps rebuild Primm as a major stopping point on the Long 15.
neutral|Yet we are at throat of the Great Bear. Victory is at hand.
neutral|It's my medicine, dearie. It keeps me calm, but it makes my memory go all fuzzy. That's why I only take my dosage every other time.
neutral|He wouldn't show his hand like that if he weren't prepared to move. And neither the NCR or Legion can spare the troops to investigate.
surprise|Yeah, that's a pretty piece of work. Makes me wonder why you'd turn on the NCR, especially when they had us cold.
neutral|If you change your mind, though, come find me, and we'll talk more.
neutral|Sure, I could do some more thinking. What should I do my thinking about this time?
neutral|We'll... we'll pay you. Whatever we got, you can have it. We'll put together a collection every couple of days.
neutral|I don't want to rush you or anything, but time is of the essence. Please try to find those components as soon as you can.
joy|We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
joy|But really, as long as you don't help out the Legion, anything's better than that.
fear|There's something about that robot that doesn't seem... all right to me. I'm not saying we shouldn't take it with us.
neutral|
neutral|You got it.
fear|Don't like the way the men are looking at me.
neutral|We'll be unable to make use of their schematics any time soon. Not what I was hoping for when I asked you to do the job. Take your pay.
neutral|There you are! A few of us wanted to thank you for being such a good friend to the Brotherhood, so we've set aside some of our recycled energy cells.
surprise|A man who shot you.
fear|Hold on there! With everything you already done for this town, I'd feel ungrateful as hell if I let you risk yourself for no good reason!
neutral|Fuck you, NCR thugs! This is our land, and you won't last here forever!
neutral|Boone. That's that sniper fella, works in the dinosaur, right? I only met them but once or twice.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|Dogs roamed that city. Our tribe made peace with them. Thought they were our spirit animals - helped us hunt, provided for us in some lean times.
surprise|Is that right? You are good, aren't you?
neutral|Oh shit! They saw us. Get out of here, quick!
neutral|Be seeing you.
neutral|
neutral|I'll admit, I could see benefits to living under his rule. Certain... transgressions he'd be willing to overlook.
neutral|In big battles, Caesar deploys his legionaries in waves. Recruits up front, prime soldiers behind the recruits, old guard bringing up the rear.
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|Prospectors looking for salvage, usually. They always run when they see the mutants.
disgust|This has been a fuck of a day.
neutral|No more Khans! That's great! They're just bad people...
neutral|Had second thoughts, did you? We've made some progress since the lockdown was lifted, but the task I had in mind is still available if you want it.
neutral|Take a regular legionary and age him ten years. Whatever they lose to age they make up for with experience. Life expectancy isn't long in the Legion.
neutral|I've also given the order that all of our equipment be made available to you, not just the more mundane arms.
neutral|Happy to do it.
neutral|May there be... a hell... for you... a Tartarus...  bleak, unending...
neutral|My father ran a butcher shop here in town, but business went downhill when another vendor started selling this strange meat at half of our prices.
neutral|Hmmm. All right - you change your mind and start shooting, then I can't help you. Show up here after, I'll put you in chains.
neutral|Sure. Here's what I've got.
neutral|I'm this bunker's Head Scribe in everything but name. I supervise the research teams. I collate the reports. I attend the meetings.
neutral|You know, when I first heard about them, I was so mad, but there was this little part of me that said, "you can't do to them what they did to you."
sadness|Well, that was enough for them. They packed up what they could and we took them back north. Last I heard, they settled somewhere in Anza-Borrego.
neutral|Good luck!
neutral|You a merc? Then I guess you'd want to talk to my, uh... father. Major Dhatri. He's our CO.
neutral|I'm paranoid now, and even though you clearly don't know how to hold that thing, it'd be one less thing for me to worry about. Thanks.
neutral|That is this base's defensive system. It serves as camouflage and masks all entry and exit from the bunker.
neutral|I hope you will come find us there, wanderer! There is much to be done.
neutral|I would say he was my tutor, but that doesn't cover it.
anger|I'm surprised to see you here. Folks with your kind of reputation, I expect to see them cooking in the sand with some .44 slugs to keep them company.
neutral|Fewer than I used to. Go see for yourself.
neutral|If you were looking for someone to caravan with, I'd try the Crimson Caravan up north. They pretty much run the roads now.
neutral|I kept a glowing container from REPCONN around here for years serving no better purpose than a nightlight. Damn thing wouldn't sell.
neutral|Hold up there, that looks like Enclave tech. Take that over to Knight Lorenzo if you get a moment, he may be able to get some information out of it.
neutral|After that, we'll see what happens when the dust settles and how the Mojave looks now without Caesar coming for its throat.
neutral|Yeah, the NCR and the Legion are about due for another dustup. So, you're going to get yourself involved in that? All right, I'm in. Could be fun.
neutral|Sorry if that was getting boring!
neutral|I understand. I know you will fulfill your promise.
neutral|What do you think you're going to do? Fight you way up to the penthouse and assassinate me?
neutral|Word got back to one of our stations that raiders had been attacking the place. I went out with six rangers.
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|In what currency would you like your payout? Non-caps currencies will have fractions paid out in caps.
sadness|So we gave up, our elders couldn't bear the idea of our spirit animals burning in the afterlife.
neutral|Great, I'll let the townsfolk know you help old ladies across the street and do your best to keep the town clean if you notice litter.
anger|Vulpes Inculta, the best of my frumentarii, is dead.
neutral|Of course, one of the Great Khans did knock my radio to the floor "by accident," and it hasn't been working since.
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|Sure do. I run the courier office out of my shop. Leastaways I did before things went to hell around here.
neutral|Name's Hardin. I'm the Head Paladin of this chapter, and I think we might be able to help each other out.
neutral|After the NCR's victory at the dam, in part thanks to Follower medical support, NCR allowed the Followers to care for refugees as they see fit.
disgust|Either that or it's Canadarian or some such shit. So who is this... "Baptiste" and what does he want?
surprise|Another?!
neutral|Observe the rules, citizen.
neutral|Best of the best, that's all there is to it. Really nothing more to say than that.
anger|He must be pretty convincing if he's roped you into helping him, but you can count me out.
surprise|I saw him heading for his suite just a few minutes ago. Looked like a fox that just got caught in the henhouse. Maybe you'll catch him there.
neutral|This should only take a moment.
sadness|Oh. After spilling my guts to you, I wasn't expecting that kind of a response but... I understand.
neutral|Isn't that sweet of you to fret about me? Such a good girl. I can always help you stay hidden from the bad people so you won't get in trouble.
neutral|War would have tested them. Broken the weak with its violence, yet allowing the strong to arise.
fear|Hmm. That seems appropriately resolute and yet vague. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and go with you, but let me be clear about something.
neutral|Four years ago, we drew a line through the Mojave as clear as the Colorado River, a line that Caesar cannot cross.
sadness|I know he thinks she was kidnapped, but I'm not so sure she didn't just run off on her own.
neutral|What? Oh. All right. Guess you've got a Legion outlook on things. No problems here, there's a lot more of that in the Mojave than you see.
joy|You're right. You do need a doctor. Lucky I happened along. But first let's discuss my fee...
neutral|A courier dropped it off a couple months back. I got it working for a little while, but the darn thing pooped out.
neutral|Cheater. Done.
neutral|As the NCR moved to secure the region, the occupation of Freeside proved especially problematic.
anger|Grandma needs to have a little lie down!
anger|That was the plan. Bye.
sadness|Back to the tomb, I suppose.
surprise|Some people here seem extremely unhappy. They keep talking about getting "shafted," "swindled," and "fucked."
neutral|We know they supply the Fiends with illegal chems, but they never stick around in NCR territory for long. They know the land, and move quick.
neutral|I might know something. But my memory ain't what it used to be. Sometimes it needs motivating.
anger|Only when you're around.
neutral|You want me to quit the Crimson Caravan? Fine, I quit. You can tell McLafferty that she won't see my face again.
neutral|Yeah, go on.
neutral|Exceptional individuals, like yourself, are sometimes allowed to join the Brotherhood if they perform a valuable service for it.
joy|A courier, a doctor, and cybernetic dog. After we deal with this whole "imminent conquest of New Vegas" problem we should open an act at the Tops.
neutral|Caesar chose not to give me that information. I was only told to find you and bring you the message.
neutral|Isn't that what I just said? I know I'm responsible.
neutral|The mighty Caesar has bestowed upon you his Mark and guaranteed safe-conduct. If he wanted you dead, you would be dead already.
neutral|Anyone wise does. Vegas families pay on time, from what I've heard - even the Omertas. The White Gloves pay on time, but they're... creepy.
neutral|Here. Come back in a day if you need more.
joy|All due to you - again, you have my thanks. And all the West, too, once they pass it over the radio... after signing the right release forms.
neutral|I hope they do, but I haven't heard nothing.
neutral|The Gun Runners are almost straight north of here. A little east. Isaac has a house in their compound.
neutral|There's usually a bar in every stop along the road. Helps me sleep. Well, not really, but I tell myself that.
neutral|Hi, I'm Jean-Baptiste, and you're about to stop being a pain in my ass.
joy|The Followers taught me everything I know about medicine. Despite our humble abode here in New Vegas, we have great facilities back in the NCR.
neutral|Make a brief stop at the Atomic Wrangler, where the booze is cheaper, the tables more friendly, and the women are just like the booze!
neutral|Aggressive acts on the casino premises will be met with lethal force. Vacate the premises immediately.
anger|This was before the war. We were far enough away from Mexico City when the bombs fell that we missed the worst of it - but things got bad quick.
neutral|Well... all right. I'll stick around for a little while longer, but if you get out of line again...
neutral|I'll leave it. You can leave, too.
joy|And then, of course, the radiation started to kick in, turning me into this handsome devil you see before you.
disgust|Telling me this does not benefit you at all... you gamble with your words, and your coin is lacking.
neutral|Now go, and teach what you've learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
neutral|I've watched you move, and I can tell you simply don't have the skill to learn the technique.
neutral|Sampling the bottle's contents and finding it singularly delicious, the man gave silent thanks to his mysterious benefactor, wherever he was.
neutral|This is a null line no one will ever see.
neutral|The fine proprietors of Mick & Ralph's appreciate that kind of attitude, and would like to offer you a discount on their fine wares.
anger|I held off on filling them full of holes, so unless you give me a good reason to cool my heels soon, I'm not waiting much longer.
neutral|Howdy, Pardner! Let's skedaddle! Got something to show ya!
fear|Holy shit! Run for your lives!
neutral|Now, it's not that I don't believe you, but I'm going to have to give you a little quiz to verify your citizenship status. That okay with you?
neutral|Well, what in the Sam Hill are you doing still listening to me? Get a wiggle on and find those last few Stars!
neutral|Well, I do get to make the calls on the distribution of supplies there.
joy|Good job.
neutral|Well, up north a ways you'll see a big tower. That's HELIOS One. Used to be a power plant in its day.
neutral|This armor's gonna get me killed.
neutral|We seek to heal the planet through efforts not unlike the medicine and education we offer here in the Old Mormon Fort.
neutral|Goodbye.
neutral|<growl>
neutral|Well I reckon he could be a sheriff if you have the skills to reprogram him.
neutral|Point guns at us, and we will destroy you.
neutral|Might check the Barracks, someone might need you to hoof it somewhere. Just be careful if you go up on the roof - got a sniper watching the road.
anger|MMmmahh. <Smacks lips>
neutral|You trying to start trouble? Or do you really not know where I got that name?
sadness|Good luck at Hoover Dam. I'll uh... be going now, I guess.
neutral|You mean other than some stranger with no military ID interrogating me inside our base?
anger|Lanius is the greatest of my battlefield commanders. Some might call him a great man, but I'm not sure he qualifies.
neutral|Good, then you have your orders. See that Mr. House does not present a problem.
neutral|Heh... I knew you'd be the death of me.
neutral|Okay children, today we are going to be reading Lad's Life.
anger|Yeah, exactly. They don't.
neutral|Graham helped Caesar with the Blackfoots after they got captured together. Up until Hoover Dam, he was Caesar's legate.
neutral|Women are beneath notice, as Caesar has taught us. I'm only allowing you to speak to me because you are Caesar's guest.
neutral|You don't look like you're from around here, so I guess I can believe that.
neutral|Interesting. Okay, next question - what was the original name of the NCR capital - The Boneyard, Shady Sands, Aradesh, or Vault 13?
anger|Don't matter much how we settle this, as long as it gets settled.
neutral|And it's a shame, but I think there's people on the NCR side who feel more strongly than I do.
neutral|All right, forget about blaming Crenshaw. Just bomb the monorail.
neutral|It lay destroyed and gathering dust, waiting for scavengers to pick through its remains for salvage.
neutral|Maybe ask Jeannie May. Nothing happens in this town that she don't know about. She'll be up in the lobby, most days.
disgust|Yeah, yeah I will, and you sure as hell aren't taking it. Can't believe I was even listening to you.
surprise|Go with you? And why the hell would I do that.
sadness|Helping the NCR is better than helping Mr. House, but I don't think it's the best solution for the people in New Vegas.
neutral|This is exactly the kind of thing I'm trying to avoid by ousting McNamara.
neutral|Your belongings will be returned to you when you leave.
neutral|There's an underground facility there that might have the special hardware required to use the data on the Platinum Chip!
neutral|Okay! Anything else?
neutral|Okay.
neutral|I still need the igniting agent, of course. And three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
surprise|You're seriously going to draw on me? Fine, do it, see what happens.
neutral|We don't have the money to pay for the water, so I rigged the pump station to divert water to the local cisterns from time to time.
neutral|Thanks, I've come a long way.
neutral|What? Why the hell would I want to do that?
neutral|Fuck you, NCR thugs! This is our land, and you won't last here forever!
neutral|I'm in charge of the radio - hence the title "Comm Officer." I'd much rather be out on patrol, since nothing much happens around here.
sadness|I did have a test in mind using Lily, but since she's dead, that's no longer a possibility. Regrettable. Anyway, you've done all you can.
joy|You're right though. He's gone now, so I'm not going to let it bother me anymore. Thanks.
neutral|Oh. Well, all right.
neutral|Yeah, I guess me and the guys could push this place over pretty easily.
neutral|How the hell did you get in here? Where the fuck are my guards?
neutral|Don't take in the view for too long, though - word is, the Legion's on the move!
neutral|Mom was from East of the Colorado, though, not sure what tribe. Was before the time Caesar rounded them up, made them Legion.
disgust|With those skinny little arms? Not before the bouncer put two in the back of your head. Now stop being stupid.
neutral|There's also hollowpoint bullets which have the opposite effect - you can kill unarmored targets easier, but they don't do shit against armor.
neutral|What'll fight on Blue?
neutral|They do it a lot, the Legion. Using kids. They know we'll hesitate.
neutral|We've got that covered. They won't be a problem.
neutral|Enjoy yourself.
neutral|Well, I'm not one for soft living... or soft men, let me tell you. I'm guessing neither are you.
anger|Hope they're in hell right now, blinking, trying to figure out where they fucked up.
sadness|If you need me, et cetera.
neutral|The training might take several hours, so keep that in mind.
disgust|How noble of you.
neutral|Tell everyone you meet of what you saw here. The Legion can handle the rest.
fear|Maybe this alliance with Caesar will help, but I don't know.
neutral|No need to get angry about this. Look, I'll let you take the test again if you want. Go and clear your mind and come back, and we'll try again.
neutral|We've accomplished a great deal, you and I. One last task, and our work is complete. I'll see you in the control room.
neutral|Nah, I'm gonna be busy.
neutral|Tough, independent, and as ruthless as they come. They're holed up in Red Rock Canyon, and it's this station's job to keep an eye on them.
anger|They like to pretty up their mission with trappings of chivalry, but the truth is they're horders. They horde technology.
neutral|There's only a handful of us, though, so the best tactic would be for us to swoop in where the target isn't expecting us. How am I doing?
neutral|Most people just call it NCRCF. That's NCR Correctional Facility.
neutral|Shoulda brought something to read...
neutral|Watch your back out there.
neutral|Hmm. All right. If his sentence was closing up I can see about getting him pardoned.
neutral|It was never meant to be used with any regularity, and the other systems here were not designed to accommodate such usage.
neutral|Though Arcade's intentions were pure and his goals were noble, he ultimately succumbed to the harsh brutality of the Mojave like so many before him.
neutral|It's straight up Route 93 from here. Just keep following the road north.
disgust|Anyway, she said all he wanted to do was scan her brain and make her dress up in different outfits.
neutral|If there were any survivors, they're going to be in the Town Hall. If you can get inside, let me know if you find anyone.
neutral|Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though.
sadness|I'm going to bed. We'll talk later.
neutral|Aw, sugar, why'd you have to go make Mr. House mad? Now we've got to get all messy shooting you to little bits.
neutral|Alright, ask away.
neutral|Pleasure doing business with you.
joy|Gomorrah is the favorite of the NCR troops on the Strip. If you like girls, alcohol, gambling, and drugs then Gomorrah is just the place for you.
neutral|We figured he was just in shock, so we gave him a place to lie low. We didn't actually expect anyone to come after him.
neutral|Yeah, forget about it.
neutral|The Great Khans deal in illegal chems. There's a good chance that most chems you come across were made by Great Khans.
neutral|Well, it's the strangest thing. Last time it happened I could swear I heard someone cry out for help. Sounded like a big fella.
neutral|Please don't hurt us no more. I'm begging you.
neutral|I shouldn't have said anything in the first place, and I'd rather not get you into the habit of crossing the NCR.
neutral|It's neural degradation. Bio med gel can only preserve a living brain for so long, so you'll need to find a replacement.
neutral|Guess I was right about the bad news, huh? Same look Elder McNamara always gave me when I was up for promotion.
anger|My guess is Legion, they're trying to cut NCR's supply line... and the Mojave Outpost is proof. Got us locked up tighter than a New Vegas virgin.
neutral|No no, you can hold onto him for a little while longer, I think. You deserve that much at least, for what you've done.
neutral|Let's see... I've been a farmhand, a bouncer, a bandit, and an NCR trooper. I don't recommend any of them.
neutral|Invigorated by his travels with the Courier, Raul once more took up his guns in memory of his lost Rafaela.
anger|Feels like a Brahmin kicked me.
neutral|You're doing it on purpose, aren't you?
neutral|Another proud NCR camp.
joy|Time was, I was a pretty good shot with a pistol. I guess I'm still half-decent. These old bones aren't much use in hand-to-hand fighting, though.
neutral|
neutral|Again, goal number one is to eliminate Mr. House and install my neuro-computational matrix on the Lucky 38's mainframe!
neutral|I can't help it! There's a little bit of me in every Securitron out on the Strip, so if this instance gets destroyed, I just download to a new one.
neutral|Should our worst fears become realized, please bring back all three of the holotapes from the patrols. Otherwise, bring our brothers home.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Hey, look over there! It's those Mojave rats again, coming to take our water!
neutral|and halitosis.
neutral|I demand to know who did this!
neutral|Hot-headed to the end, Sheriff Meyers choose to oppose Caesar's takeover of Primm with a standoff.
neutral|Their superior physicality makes them extremely dangerous up close, so I've had the men run drills for taking on larger, stronger opponents.
neutral|Except Neil.
neutral|Well, that could be Violet, or it could be someone else entirely. I'll take your word for it, but I can't give you a full reward.
neutral|If we're going to operate on the surface again, it would be nice to do so with as much information at our fingertips as possible. Good luck.
disgust|Kimball's Kimball, not sure which end is his ass or his head. Caravan families are causing trouble, Big Circle getting tense - the usual.
neutral|Due to the Courier's intervention, Chief Hanlon abandoned his plan to sabotage the defense of Hoover Dam.
joy|Carla was a knockout. Whenever Boone walked around with her, he always had this funny grin on his face like he couldn't believe his luck.
neutral|The Followers of the Apocalypse were hunted down and exterminated, and Old Mormon Fort was turned into a pile of rubble.
neutral|Unfortunately, it comes with the territory around here. But being afraid sucks, no doubt about it.
neutral|As I said, our scouts were some ways west of HELIOS when they disappeared.
disgust|Look, you want gossip, go to the bar downstairs and listen to a whole lot of nothing. Me, I got to keep watch, then fill out the daily log.
neutral|If you want to take a shot at it, take these.
neutral|Nah, I'm gonna chill with my girl.
anger|Killing Kimball would've struck fear into the NCR. It's unfortunate that you weren't able to take advantage of this opportunity.
neutral|You can tell the Lieutenant that I caved. And... thanks.
neutral|Well, I think that's a fine idea. I'll give you a good flat rate, and you can stay as long as you like. Least till the busy season comes. Sound good?
neutral|It's a violation of their contract. I authorize you to deal with them in any way you see fit.
neutral|Though the Courier's agenda was debated by many, he was honored by NCR for his support of the military at Hoover Dam.
neutral|Caesar prides himself on selecting the right tool to overcome each new obstacle. In Lanius, he found his hammer.
neutral|The future is not written, human, and it is foolish to squint at what cannot be seen.
sadness|It's been so many years that people forget about it. Conscription brings in fresh troops to die here every month. Like it's routine.
neutral|<Coughing Fit>
neutral|There's a bunch! Some of them you've already met - like the Chairmen, for instance!
neutral|You don't want us chatting, trust me. As for the girl - I just want to talk to her.
neutral|Oh, don't you worry about me, dearie, your grandma knows how to stay quiet.
anger|Then you'll have to be extraordinarily persuasive. Or kill them - their leaders, at least.
neutral|I hear rumors, that's about it. Supposedly they keep slaves and they got some real nasty ways of killing folks.
neutral|What do you have in mind?
neutral|Vertibird pilot. Seventy-one missions and only lost one chopper. Rotor malfunction over Klamath. Hard landing, but I walked away.
neutral|Still, even power from the Dam - that's not enough to wash the salt out of the wound here, and it only benefits NCR in the Mojave, not the West.
joy|You hear about the girls dancing in the fountain? What I wouldn't give to see that show.
neutral|Then that is your choice. If you should change your mind, please return.
neutral|
disgust|And these bodies, these people out in the sand, they aren't raiders. Aren't even heavily armed.
neutral|Stay safe.
neutral|Oh, grandma feels much better now.
neutral|I... wish I had something to give you. I- wait! What about punching? That's the gift that keeps on giving.
neutral|I might be going scum-hunting later. You game?
neutral|Done.
sadness|I'm not much use besides being a portable encyclopedia, really. I guess you could use me as a pack brahmin, but my knees aren't so good any more.
neutral|Hnh. Willing to tackle the caravan families? Keeping that bunch in line... well, that's no easy job.
joy|Here's a guy that's been beat all to hell, right? I mean, he could have retired from the service, but instead he signs back on and does what he can.
neutral|Sure.
neutral|While I can't dispute that you've earned our gratitude, I'm afraid you're going to have to be patient. Such a change takes time.
neutral|As long as you don't become an outright enemy of the Legion, payment will continue.
neutral|Glad to hear it! I'll switch over all radio broadcasts to the new encrypted channels - this ought to help us stay a step ahead of any spies.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|Wha-? No, no wait. Look, I just need time. Don't rat me out to them.
neutral|It is for you that I have come here, and it is because of you that I am able to do so.
neutral|I smell Hydra in the air, just a whiff.
neutral|Second, we want to prevent the Legion from advancing across the Colorado River and endangering the home states.
sadness|First thing that comes to mind is to turn me in. But that might not be the best play, all things considered.
neutral|He should be back tomorrow.
neutral|You really know how to make a robot happy! Seriously, you just made my day.
anger|Damn it. That'll wipe out the town treasury. If that's what it takes...
neutral|I disagree. You're the one who wanted our help in the first place. You want us to succeed, you go talk to Moreno.
neutral|Well, at least you're man enough to admit it. Now get the hell out of here. If I see you again, it'll be through my rifle's sight.
neutral|...must be his pet, or some shit. Doesn't let anybody near that Brahmin. Somebody puts a bullet in her, I bet that'd piss him off good.
neutral|Yeah, I... everybody depends on you, you know? But they don't ask you about how you feel. What you worry about.
neutral|Chavez formed his own crew and have been hitting traders on their own. Everybody I've sent after him either got killed or weren't able to catch him.
anger|They know nothing of my tactics - or the strength of my forces. They will learn.
neutral|I don't have much protection here. Mind helping me out?
neutral|I admire your bravery, but coming down here after what you've done is just foolish. So be it, Legion dog!
anger|Fantastic. Now the only influential person who gave a damn about Westside is gone. Great job.
neutral|Everyone was very supportive. I received a promotion to colonel and given greater responsibility, but my days as a Ranger were over.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|Did Boyd put you up to this? I am so sick of this harassment. You tell her to stop wasting my time with this bullshit.
neutral|Problem solved! Quick and to the point! I like the way you work!
neutral|Nobody's dick's that long, not even Long Dick Johnson, and he had a fucking long dick. Thus, the name.
neutral|As long as we hide in here, ignoring the outside, our days are numbered.
neutral|Not sure what my parents would think of me fighting for the NCR.
neutral|Okay.
neutral|Is it really so hard not to engage in cannibalism? My goodness...
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
sadness|Though it has a noble goal, I don't think this research will yield much fruit. No pun intended.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|The Courier, with the aid of Yes Man, drove both the Legion and the NCR from Hoover Dam, securing New Vegas' independence from both factions.
neutral|With the transplant of Lupa's brain, Rex gained all of the donor's experiences traveling with the Legion.
neutral|The Fiends attacked Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam, but the NCR repulsed the attack with minimal losses.
neutral|All right.
fear|Praetorians, to me!
surprise|I thought I was done forever... but after traveling with you, I realize I've always had my doubts.
neutral|Assuming an NCR pardon comes with the job - and it had better - I'll also need to be able to do things my own way.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|We are the heirs of that civilization, torchbearers eastward of the Pacific, into the darkness of this wasted land.
neutral|All right, then.
sadness|Vegas burned brighter than ever, Securitrons filled the streets, and Cass's heart skipped... just a little.
fear|The Brotherhood? On the attack? I think we would have heard something from them by now.
neutral|Don't tell me. He married the hooker.
disgust|That's your excuse?
anger|Sweetie, grandma needs some more ammunition!
neutral|In that case, don't mind me. Carry on.
neutral|It feels like we're working toward something more important. That's more than the sum of good deeds that we do.
disgust|Smells like junk.
neutral|Sometimes I wonder how much of my father they see in me. They went through a lot together, but my family went through it, too.
neutral|Good luck planting a surveillance device here in the Lucky 38 without my knowing about it.
surprise|Some of my scouts did report an abandoned Vault near Nellis Air Force Base. Overrun by ghouls, they said.
sadness|I got the feeling she was trying to get Boone to leave with her, but I guess she got tired of waiting.
neutral|Good luck.
neutral|Well, darling, it's a royal flush that beats all! So let's crown this hand!
neutral|Goodbye.
neutral|All right. What's on your mind?
neutral|Best Friend Tabitha, some of our listeners may wonder how you can call them dumb-dumbs on the air like this.
neutral|Well, Freeside citizens are also being attacked and I'd like you all to stop it, but I'm guessing that's not going to happen, is it?
neutral|Before you go, I've got another job available.
neutral|Stay safe.
anger|Well, I'm not a goddamn charity, so come back when you do.
neutral|Hope you're not here to chase your losses.
neutral|Carrying too much shit to move.
neutral|Yeah, there is.
neutral|Sure thing. Let me have a look.
joy|I found it in a costume shop. It was sort of my calling card, you know? "Raul the Ghoul, the zombie vaquero of Mexico City."
anger|A bunch of degenerate slavers, led by a madman who calls himself Caesar. Every one of them is a barbarian to the last.
neutral|How frightfully uncouth. I'm afraid I must insist you relinquish your weapons.
neutral|Freedom? Thank God Frank thinks we're enslaved.
neutral|
neutral|Things were rather chaotic, so I wasn't able to see exactly what happened, or who did the deed, but seeing the NCR suffer such a loss was a shock.
neutral|NCR border guard duty mostly. It's our job to make sure the caravans can move safely along I-15 and Highway 95.
neutral|Oh shit! They saw us. Get out of here, quick!
neutral|Some say the saloon owner ordered it done, in honor of the stranger. Others say it's the stranger, sampling the bottles like he promised.
neutral|We don't have time for diplomacy. This battle is coming any time now; if the leader won't be budged, he'll have to be replaced.
neutral|It makes me feel really dumb to admit this, but I don't actually know! I've never been inside the Lucky 38. No one has!
neutral|Say no more, say no more... if you say they're good, they're good!
neutral|A man nearly kills you, so you track him across the breadth of the Mojave?
neutral|Short of caps is what taught me, mostly. Ammo's expensive... so I learned to make every shot count.
neutral|Really wish we could go to some civilized places.
anger|A tribe came into Tuscon one day - more a gang, really. Dirty Dave and his six brothers. They were looking for bullets, and I sold some to them.
fear|All right - thanks for checking on that, wish it set my mind at ease, now I'm more on edge than ever.
neutral|Looking to elevate his social status, is he?
neutral|Well hey, the field's wide open, now that I'm gone. Probably lots of people looking to get in, once they hear I quit.
neutral|They got sloppy, though. Some of us managed to hide away some dynamite, and look who's in charge now.
neutral|Two shots in the head without an Auto-Doc is a lot of patching. Hope you thanked him properly.
neutral|The main building houses administration while the other building is the MP headquarters on the Strip.
neutral|No deaths, but not all of the squad got out. The Khans have Private Ackerman and Private Gilbert as hostages.
disgust|But the depths of your moral sickness, your dissolution? Nipton serves as the perfect object lesson.
neutral|I would like you to find the components we need to fix this bunker's air filtration system. I cannot overstate the importance of this task.
neutral|Hungry? Thirsty? Horny? The Atomic Wrangler has you covered!
neutral|Yes. Specializing in neuroscience, both human and canine. Of course, this lab is nothing compared to what I had when I was with the Enclave.
neutral|And those involved crimes that someone like Elder McNamara is just not capable of. You can look it up for yourself, if you want.
neutral|I wish I could explain it to you. The old chief's finally at a loss for words.
neutral|Vegas will still rise again. Your betrayal won't defeat me!
sadness|Show me something to inspire my people, or we march with Caesar, despite my misgivings.
neutral|There's a lot of answers to that question, but it started with the Ranger Unification Treaty. We weren't always the only show in town.
disgust|I know what those robots of yours can do on a bad day, and I'm not eager to toss lives at them just to make a point.
neutral|The one in the fancy suit seemed to be calling the shots, that's as much as I know. Other folks in town might know more.
fear|Hmm. I have heard some things from my most trusted Khans that makes me wonder whether this alliance is a good idea after all.
neutral|I was sku... er, performing recon, gathering information on some of the Powder Gangers, when some great Khans arrived with your friend in the suit.
neutral|Nowhere specific. I just know there are a lot of groups who're actually doing well for themselves out here.
neutral|As per their agreement, the NCR handed over all suits of salvaged power armor and in return the Brotherhood helped patrol I-15 and Highway 95.
fear|No need to get upset, youngster! We're all friends here!
neutral|I'm going to have a word with my staff about security on the premises.
neutral|Pawn shop in Westside called Miguel's. It's in outer Vegas, northwest of the Strip.
neutral|We are here as promised. Now let's kick some ass.
neutral|No, no, no... you've given me enough ammo for the Republic... but what one head may like, the other bear head may not.
neutral|There'll be some guards by the door, but just remember that the password is "Hope," and they'll let you by right quick.
anger|He's closer now than he ever was before. I was a young man once. I know what it's like to want to fight for your home, but this isn't it.
joy|This little care package is everything I need. I'll take it from here.
disgust|NCR makes a habit of going there and dumping cash, only the Strip gets fat off it.
neutral|You know, it's that "or else" part that gets stuck in my craw. It just sounds a little too much like you're trying to tell us what to do.
anger|No! Grandma won't leave her babies!
surprise|Hnh. You believe your own words, even if I do not.
neutral|A man? Well then this... well this can't be. Two disappearances in my hotel? What will people say?
neutral|<growl>
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
anger|You challenging me? Serious now.
neutral|I ain't saying I'm afraid of them or nothing, but I'll be staying out of their way.
neutral|Right here... where did you come from?
neutral|Sometimes it makes grandma forget things she doesn't want to forget, pumpkin.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|I'm not sure I have anything I want to hear from you, but you can have your moment.
sadness|Yeah... but I wasn't expecting a fight when I came up here. And now that we're talking, I don't like the sound of things.
surprise|Huh? Look, kitty cat, me and Diane, we don't dig on that politics stuff, savvy? We just make the product and make it get to a good home.
joy|There were more than a few missions where I took the scenic route home just so I could stay in the air. Caught hell for it every time, but worth it!
neutral|Well done. This is a small step in the right direction, but it's damn good to move forward again. Now, I believe congratulations are in order.
neutral|But now you have come. Once again, the creator has sent a human to help us across a seemingly insurmountable obstacle.
neutral|The Omertas especially are just awful brutes. The Chairmen and the White Glove Society at least pretend to have some culture.
fear|What? How is that not bad? In fact, how could it get worse?
anger|Enough.
disgust|I think I'm going to be sick.
neutral|It's a pretty dull place, but I hear there was a bit of excitement when this tribal from Arroyo came to town years back. All before my time, though.
neutral|Still hiding that hair of yours, Veronica?
neutral|Yeah, if you brought her back here. Is she behind you or something? 'Cause I don't see her.
joy|Right now, I'm sure you're asking yourself, "Why hasn't some lucky man scooped this bachelor off his feet?" Like I said, I'm boring.
neutral|For what it's worth, I appreciate you didn't shed any more blood. We need to save our strength for the Legion.
neutral|You are to meet with Cato Hostilius - he'll have more information on ways to eliminate Kimball.
disgust|House's machines, his technologies - what do they propose? The possibility of victory without sacrifice. No blood spilled, just... rivets.
neutral|So what are they doing with that dapper gentleman who wears a checked suit? I wouldn't mind a suit like that.
neutral|She's clean.
neutral|Coincidentally, I'm also looking for her. I've got a business offer she'd be interested in.
anger|You been far enough West I'm guessing to know how far that claw stretches. Fuck with the Bear, and...
neutral|They seemed real happy together. I really oughtta to get to know them better. They're probably nice folk.
fear|If by "sometimes" you mean "a lot of times," I agree. Please, just... settle down, okay?
neutral|Sorry, ma'am, but ain't enough caps in all of New Vegas to make me do that. Nuh-uh.
neutral|Same as any civilized town - don't start any fights or steal anything, we'll treat you fair. Not a lot to ask.
joy|Back in your good graces again? I knew you'd see the light.
joy|Think I'll do just that.
neutral|That beat up old thing? What do you want to know?
neutral|My good lady, I believe I may have some information that would prove useful.
joy|I can probably handle that. Just the same as changing a light bulb, except stickier and smellier. Right?
neutral|I had the knights refurbish a suit of our power armor for your use. It's one of the earlier models, but it should serve you well.
neutral|You're a member of the Brotherhood now, and your gear should reflect that.
neutral|It's gonna be expensive. Try not to speak. Just nod yes or no.
neutral|My observations have mostly focused on the small town to the south of here. It was cruelly attacked, its inhabitants slain nearly to the last.
neutral|Yep. I was damn good at my job, too. But after a while I just felt like a piece of meat and had to quit.
neutral|In what currency would you like your payout? Non-caps currencies will have fractions paid out in caps.
neutral|I hope they do, but I haven't heard nothing.
surprise|What's this? Ah, yes, I've heard that the Legion has sometimes had to quell tribes that did not share its vision.
neutral|Manny might know more about them. Thought he might've been friends with one or two of 'em. He's up in the dino mouth during the day.
neutral|Yeah. On top of everything else, I can't send a patrol on a bathroom break without it being ambushed by someone who heard they were coming.
neutral|Without them, the Brotherhood could never fulfill its mission. Or at least, that's what my dad always used to say.
neutral|Let me have a word with a few other folks and I'll see if I can't round up some more members for this militia you're creating.
neutral|You're welcome to try.
neutral|Just stop by and we'll go over it again.
anger|None of your damn business. You ought to know better than to ask a man that kind of question.
neutral|Yup. Guess it's just down to you and fancy-pants. I wouldn't worry about him - he looked all hat and no cattle if you ask me.
neutral|Kings dress like strutting girls, all fancy like.
neutral|I'm a trader primarily, for what it's worth with things like they are. I also run the local Mojave Express outpost.
neutral|I'm gonna have to keep to myself. Better that way. For everyone.
neutral|When news reached Freeside that Legion forces were approaching New Vegas, Arcade did his best to help people escape with adequate supplies.
neutral|Keep me apprised of any leads you get. This guy's gotten a lot of my men killed. I'm just itching to return the favor.
surprise|This? This is nothing. You should see some of the wounds I've seen paladins come back with.
neutral|Bring those on back to me, and we'll get cooking.
neutral|I thought you weren't interested.
neutral|Wonder if any of these folks would be up for shots of courage - and a wager.
neutral|I help folks strip down the more complicated bits of salvage they bring in - engines, mostly.
anger|I get headaches every once in a while. So what? Anyway, we have other matters to discuss.
neutral|Look. The NCR isn't everyone here, and it definitely ain't you.
neutral|The demons appeared from nowhere... except it might be more accurate to say they never actually "appeared" at all.
neutral|That's... that's terrible. I hope the poor little guy gave as good as he got. He always was a fighter.
neutral|Hey, that's great! You shouldn't have much trouble getting those fixed up, then. Just stop back when you're done.
neutral|Damn, that's got to hurt. Okay, hold still, it's gonna get worse before it gets better.
neutral|I... hope they don't hit the Mojave Outpost.
neutral|I don't know which is true. I see a lot, I think a lot. There's a lot to hear through the 188, too, that maybe accounts for the thinking.
neutral|They continued to serve with distinction for many years.
neutral|Well, then, take two shots of whiskey and call me in the morning. Heh heh, little doctor humor. Okay, let's have a look.
anger|I do say so. The Followers aren't a military organization. If anyone knew what he was up to, they weren't talking.
neutral|So you're saying without you, Hoover Dam just beats slower and dies. I believe it, I saw it myself this day, you woke it up, true enough.
neutral|I would put this chapter back on the right path, if I could just assume leadership.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|I can't use you. Had you shown moderation in your dealings with the NCR, we'd be in a different position.
neutral|Slavers. Raiders. Tough-talking hoodlums with gangs who liked to kick around towns. Back then the NCR military was still young.
fear|I'll make sure you're allowed to bring the necessary medications into the camp.  Hurry back. I don't know how long I've got.
joy|That so, well, if all you brought is words, then this is going to be one short conversation.
anger|A week, maybe two... it doesn't matter!
neutral|The Courier, who had a mixed history in the Wasteland, kept the status quo at Hoover Dam.
neutral|Holy Christ. Get- get away from me!
neutral|I've been around dogs all my life. They're my life, always were - all the way back when I was a tribal, one of the Hangdogs, outside Denver.
neutral|And if any of the others messed with me, I broke theirs too. Sometimes I'd break them even if they were nice to me, just to show them what's what.
neutral|I could never resist a woman like you. Here, take the key, but don't tell anyone where you go it.
neutral|What do you want done?
fear|You make an excellent point. I never liked that Cachino fuck anyway. Here you go.
surprise|Not from the Legion, if that's what you're getting at. Books. Sheet music. Gladiator movie holotapes. Bits and pieces here and there.
neutral|Hnh. Maybe you're right. Brimmed hats always throw me off.
neutral|Done.
neutral|After saving a few tourists from trouble, I got a reputation for being a stand-up guy again, and after a decade managed to save up enough to retire.
neutral|With Mr. House out of the picture, part of the Securitron army was diverted to the Strip to keep order. Any chaos on the streets was ended, quickly.
anger|Can't believe you did that.
neutral|Goodbye.
neutral|If you're looking for the real trouble, head straight into the mountains. Men don't walk up there, for good reasons, kid.
neutral|You'd think it'd be bad for the Strip but... but I guess it must be good!
neutral|Our aim is to gradually shape a better brighter future for the wasteland.
surprise|Gambling? What, you looking to start a game now that the smoke's died down-
neutral|Cobb's friends are the bigger problem, and when he doesn't get back, they'll be coming here for blood. There's no way I fight can them all.
sadness|Sure, Caesar's a drag, but as long as we got each other, we don't care who the top dogs roll with.
neutral|Arcade was outraged by Mr. House's power play following the defeat of Caesar's Legion at Hoover Dam.
fear|It can't be! How the hell...
neutral|As for the others, some people just plain don't respect others, and that's a no-no. If there's one thing I won't tolerate, it's lack of respect.
neutral|Only Brothers sent on special assignments are given mission discs. If you should find any on the lost patrols, let me know.
neutral|Minds her own business, too. She knows what it's like for people to go through things they'd rather not talk about.
neutral|The Omertas, who run Gomorrah, have become suspicious of Martina's frequent visits to their casino. Soon they'll pay her a visit of their own.
neutral|That's great news! I wish I could visit their casino! They have a refined sense of taste!
neutral|Can't. The King's got me busy on something.
neutral|Mayor here used to shelter gangers, hear tell. Guess it didn't save him.
neutral|Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though.
joy|A number of NCR Ranger stations have been wiped off the face of the Mojave, thanks to you.
neutral|Shit, yeah. Mayor Cobb - I like the sound of that. Running my own town will give me more pull with the guys at the prison, too.
joy|Sometimes it can be a while between visits by rangers so it's good to have someone around to keep the lights on for them.
neutral|It looks like you've got a fair number of Stars in your saddlebags. You're still a few cards short of a hand, though.
neutral|I am Gabban, of Caesar's Legion. I serve my master as the one of his Frumentarii.
neutral|Where else?
neutral|She took control of this place almost two years ago. The Super Mutants here do whatever she says - and she says humans are to be killed on sight.
neutral|Yeah, that's what I thought.
neutral|Learned to shoot on our ranch. Way west of here. Same as the LT, he's a f-farm kid too.
neutral|And Legion, from what I've heard, they don't do the "stop tolls" on the roads or in the outposts like some NCR quartermasters do.
neutral|Great, I'd love to take a look at that log data.
joy|The Profligates still hate me more than they hate you, I think, but I've been at this longer than you have.
anger|As I was saying, I hoped they'd leave the town in peace. Instead, they decided to stop at Claudia's brothel to take the edge off.
neutral|What the hell are you talking about? What is this?
neutral|They're tough sons of bitches, mean but not crazy - they'll leave you alone unless you've got something they want.
neutral|And hear tell, my Dad was a crack shot, so I don't want to dirty the family name. Not out of pride - respect.
neutral|Just as long as you keep making waves, that is. Be seeing you.
neutral|Done.
neutral|They're very big. And strong.
neutral|Betsy's shrugged it off like it was nothing, but her behavior keeps getting worse - always making passes at every woman who wanders by.
neutral|Well, the problem is that's left us with enough Securitrons to drive off a weakened NCR force -  but not enough to keep them from coming back!
neutral|Aw, just when the standing around was getting exciting.
neutral|While he might've preferred rejoining his old unit, Boone couldn't bring himself to abandon the city where he'd met his wife.
neutral|Violence is something of a way of life there, but there's been a disturbing rise in the number of attacks on our people lately.
neutral|Here. This is the bounty I put on her head. It's yours.
neutral|Telemetry showed that they'd been attacked with energy weapons! House was pretty sure it was the Brotherhood!
neutral|My family has enough men and guns to field a small army, but the NCR can field a really, really big army. Fighting them is out of the question now.
neutral|I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint you. There's much to be done, but nothing for someone with your skills.
neutral|I agree. That is why we do everything we can to teach the children from birth to defend themselves and serve the tribe.
neutral|They guard their roads, their supply lines - even Fiends would hesitate before going after any trader dealing with Legion.
neutral|Those few who were outside the Hidden Valley bunker when it was destroyed settled into new lives, or headed west to find a new chapter to join.
joy|Okay, I'll have them here for you if you want them.
anger|Now I am here, and make markers of your people as the Legion carves its way West.
neutral|Where else?
neutral|Me? I ran with the toughest gang in the Hub. You've heard of the Hub, right? It's, uh, west of here, I think, back in California.
neutral|Those who weren't killed in the attack attempted to flee, but were caught at Mojave Outpost, court-martialed, and hanged from the ranger monument.
disgust|As long as you leave right after you put your caps down, you're on.
neutral|If you're looking for the real trouble, head straight into the mountains. Men don't walk up there, for good reasons, kid.
neutral|Okay! Who needs artillery support? Not the good guys, that's for sure!
surprise|Makes for a powerful gift, in a culture that forbids painkillers and is largely ignorant of medical science.
neutral|Well, you have to know what to look for.
neutral|Stay an ally of the Legion and we will share our loot with you. If you start working against us - or become an enemy - our deal ends.
neutral|True enough. Maybe I can't fill my father's shoes. I wouldn't even know how.
neutral|I am Vulpes Inculta, of Caesar's Legion. I serve my master as the greatest of his Frumentarii.
anger|I can only hope that the Omertas died when their treachery was exposed, to have the plan succeed only would have sullied the Legion.
neutral|You know what, I think you mean that. All right... maybe...
neutral|Lately he brings a teddy bear with him and props it on the bed like it's watching us. It's creepy as hell.
neutral|Sure.
neutral|Well, at least I can talk to you unlike that bastard Caesar and that plate-faced general. It'll do.
neutral|I'll tell them you took out a band of NCR raiders planning to rob locals as they left Freeside.
disgust|Yeah. I know him. You'll probably find him in his room upstairs. He usually just sends down for girls or food.
neutral|Let's go. We're wasting our time.
anger|We'll see about that. In any case, we can't let Caesar's death get in the way of the Legion's goals.
neutral|Still, a requisition form or two can get lost, and they're not going to come check... so here you go, just between us.
neutral|His footlocker is in the barracks in the main concourse.
neutral|Good luck, soldier.
fear|It could be better. If we can find a way to work toward the independence of New Vegas, that would be ideal.
neutral|I just told you, the robots are going to handle it. They'll break the plane down into pieces and move it up from Callville Bay in one shot.
neutral|And after all the trouble I went through to kill all those witnesses. Guess now I have one more than I thought.
neutral|Done.
neutral|We've been here for a few years, just looking for a place we can call our own.
neutral|Slavery... the future of... mankind? What... have you... done?
neutral|Confound it. I knew I shoulda stayed with him. Ted, I'm so sorry, boy.
neutral|For years, I played a miser with my emergency power supply. I began to run out of reserves around the time I woke the first batch of Securitrons.
neutral|Still grappling with self-doubt over his usefulness in the face of old age, Raul was never able to find peace with himself.
neutral|That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
neutral|I deliver things and stuff for the people here. They give me caps to do it.
neutral|Oh no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
anger|Avenge Caesar!
neutral|No, Legate Lanius is Caesar's second. The Legate replaced the Burned Man after the Legion's defeat at the Dam several years ago.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
sadness|All right... there you go, caravan's yours. Feel kind of relieved, actually. Guess I didn't realize how much I was carrying around with just the name.
neutral|You know, like one of the tribes from the East - we got 'em out West, too. NCR's herding 'em up, though, domesticating them.
neutral|We've given up our claim to HELIOS, and we don't have any interest in claiming Hoover Dam, so our ambitions are not at crossed purposes.
neutral|Freeside's a little dangerous for people traveling alone or in small groups. You go without a guard, you're rolling the dice, you know?
neutral|I'll check it out. Thanks!
neutral|Come quietly now, I don't want to have to hurt you.
neutral|As much as I hate to lose a customer, it's just unavoidable sometimes.
surprise|Sure, boss. I saw lots of guys like that while I was held prisoner by an insane supermutant in an isolated mountain fortress. Can you narrow it down?
neutral|But here's this guy who's an elite commander in their army and he just gives himself up, even as his men are slitting their own throats around him.
neutral|We're also responsible for keeping the borders of the NCR secure, scouting out threats, that sort of thing.
neutral|O... kay. I'll do my best.
neutral|Nothing. I'm working right now. You want to know more, head over to our hangout at the center of town. It's kinda hard to miss.
neutral|In the aftermath of the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, the Kings took the opportunity to viciously force all NCR citizens out of Freeside.
neutral|Did you want to take it again right away?
joy|Hey, who doesn't enjoy a little pinch and squeal every once in a while?
neutral|Chairmen, Omertas... a whole bunch of families rule Vegas, don't step out a line as long as money's to be made.
neutral|You not buy?! Then you die!
neutral|For my effort, I was promoted to major. Not quite the way I'd have wanted it.
neutral|We now consist of 5 states, that make up the greatest nation since the Great War.
neutral|Anyway, he wanted it re-enabled and connected to Mr. House's data network. The trick was getting it to be invisible on the network.
neutral|Unfortunately for you, I'm not authorized to trade with you. It's against regulations.
neutral|That's not to excuse the other Elders, though. They all covet technology for its own sake. Some are just more fanatical than others.
neutral|Be safe, human. And thanks again for everything.
anger|What ya talking about? I been ready!
neutral|Just rolling along on my spurs. Looks like I just might make it to New Vegas after all.
neutral|Here, I'll show you. It's easy, once you get used to it. First, we'll start with putting it on...
disgust|In case I'm not laying down enough sarcasm, you just screwed up the lives of a bunch of struggling people.
neutral|I can't see as how I'd charge you after the generous things you've done for the town. The room's on me.
neutral|They moved into the quarry after the Powder Gangers came through and made off with most of our dynamite.
neutral|Hold on, now, hold on. Just a moment...
joy|Right behind you, boss.
neutral|Started? Took to it like a fish to water... well, if you know what a fish is.
anger|Congratulations, you just became my personal physician. Do you have what you need to treat my condition?
neutral|You are so misunderstood! Well, it's their loss!
neutral|Normally I'd just be the base's medical officer, but my other duties say otherwise.
neutral|Go to him, and you will understand.
neutral|Had his wife taken. I don't think he'll ever be the same as he was. Damn shame.
neutral|Fine by me. You the one missing out on exciting details.
neutral|Still, it's not about the money. Dad'd spin like a twister if he ever heard I sold our name for anything.
neutral|Goodbye.
joy|Still, we give the Van Graffs the what-for, that means all those guns they used on my caravan - we can take and use on the Crimson Caravan.
neutral|They carried the secrets of their old lives to their graves.
anger|Drinking used to cause all sorts of trouble back West - before I punched enough people, that is, and they learned to lay low when the whiskey hit.
neutral|Of course, if the NCR were to hear of that, it would be obvious who told them.
anger|Do I look like a fucking arms caravan to you?
neutral|If the Boomers will toe the line, I can focus on other preparations. But not without first rewarding your initiative. Now moving on...
neutral|Well, let's see: the NCR has an embassy here, but why you'd want to go talk to a bunch of boring old politicians I surely don't know.
fear|Oh, uh... of hearing stories. About energy weapons. They're... pretty crazy. Yeah.
neutral|That said, if you were to strike at the Profligates, butcher them, trouble their operations... this will not go unnoticed.
neutral|The information you've provided will suffice. When the battle for Hoover Dam comes, I'll make sure my Securitrons are waiting for the Omertas.
neutral|First I'm going to pull off whatever log data I can. Then, I'll use some of the tech around here to upgrade its weapons systems.
neutral|Though General Oliver and Chief Hanlon were both praised for their leadership, the chief quietly stepped out of the spotlight.
neutral|If this statement is being broadcast, I am deceased. Please approach a Securitron and take one of the printed obituaries.
neutral|Any other questions?
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|Good point. You've been encouraging the others to stand up and fight, maybe I should take the same advice. After all, I also lived in Navarro.
neutral|All right, you come here, armed with whiskey, we'll make a sport of it.
disgust|Place stinks of sand, piss, and vomit.
neutral|I'm afraid I'm going to have to search you before letting you in. The only weapons allowed on the premises are the ones we're selling.
neutral|I never had a grandfather - not that I knew, anyway - but Elijah was in some ways what I'd imagine a grandfather to be.
sadness|I mean, I'm not like them. I was born at Navarro and my father served with them, but I wasn't really part of the Enclave.
neutral|Maybe. What do you want to know?
neutral|Yeah, who am I kidding? It's funny, you get stuck in your room for a few weeks, you start to worry the world's gonna fall apart without you.
fear|He went south, back to the Grand Canyon, back to Caesar. And that was the last we saw or heard from Joshua Graham.
neutral|Crenshaw's a problem child. Lots of run-ins with his superiors. It'll be easy for them to believe he's working for the Legion.
anger|The Profligates' morale is in the shitter. They've occupied the Mojave for years, getting picked off one by one. They were told it'd be easy.
neutral|Best of luck to you.
neutral|Wonderful! I'll keep tabs on the situation at the dam! See you in a bit!
neutral|What the hell are you doing?
neutral|If that's the case, then I guess I'll go spend my money elsewhere.
neutral|You sure? Some other time, then.
neutral|The Legion marched over the Hoover Dam with the help of one who was as brutal and merciless as the worst of them: The Courier.
neutral|You remember how the Securitron army at the Fort got destroyed? For very, very good reasons, of course...
neutral|Not exactly sure... radio's been on the fritz, and since I haven't heard any shooting, I don't think it's urgent. Can't hurt to go ask her.
neutral|Because I'm not! Can't you just tell? Oh, forget it. I'll just head over to that pawn shop by the east gate.
sadness|And I don't like saying this, but the Mojave's safer with him... there.
neutral|Caesar's elite guard. They travel with him wherever he goes. A bit of insurance in case any of his guests get funny ideas.
anger|Fine, then, not trying to pry. Just wondering what would make a Courier run around the desert without a contract is all. Forget I asked.
neutral|Say no more, say no more... if you say they're good, they're good!
neutral|Fuck you, NCR thugs! This is our land, and you won't last here forever!
neutral|Sorry, bub, but I'm fresh out of ideas. I've done all I can to scrub up your rep around here. What's done is done.
anger|Get him!
neutral|We just don't have the supplies on hand to meet that kind of demand for new weapons.
anger|All the bribes I sent to the Omertas ended up buying me nothing.
neutral|I'll be there, but it won't mean squat if the rest of the group isn't there, too.
neutral|Before you go, I've got another job available.
anger|You're right about that.  Saint James! Got a thief here!
joy|I'm still half-decent with a pistol. Not fantastic, but good enough. These old bones aren't much use in hand-to-hand fighting, though.
anger|If I get gangrene before we find a doctor...
joy|Great! I'd like you to talk to the old-timers, the Remnants. I don't think I can convince them by myself. To them, I'm still a kid.
neutral|Then again, perhaps I'd rather not know. Thank you all the same - I'm very happy to be rid of that man.
neutral|Seems like either way, there's not much I can do to help anyone.
neutral|Didn't look like nothing to me. Draw!
anger|If the NCR is broken, it will fail on its own.
neutral|Later.
neutral|Yeah, all right. Figure you could help us out the way you helped out Cobb's crew over in Goodsprings.
anger|But they don't. Caravans get butchered in the Mojave all the time, like mine. And so fucking close to Vegas, you could see it from the wall.
neutral|Every salvager who tries gets blown up, flattened, or gutted by traps. Then he starts to stink up the town and we're the ones to clean up the mess.
neutral|Before that happens, I'd ask you to complete one final task. It may seem trivial, but that's far from the case.
disgust|With your wheeled buddies as merchants? No, the East is going to be a hard nut to crack, and I don't think you know what you're in for.
neutral|Heh, I like you, friend. Have I mentioned that?
neutral|tooth decay,
neutral|What'll fight on Blue?
neutral|I'll be there at the reunion. Let's hope the others show up, too, or this plan isn't going to work.
neutral|Right now? A whole lot of sitting on my keister and counting cracks in the ceiling. I wouldn't wish it on anybody.
neutral|Fire away.
neutral|Hmm, I suppose Jack deserves a chance at love. You can tell Jack she has a free pass to enter, but he is responsible for her actions.
neutral|This is not acceptable. No self-respecting soldier of Utobitha should ever be seen running like a scared little human.
neutral|Oh yeah, I wanted to tell you that I got some new info for you. Each tip's gonna cost 100 caps now though.
neutral|Veronica.
sadness|Some people do. I just... don't.
neutral|From there I didn't have a lot of career options, as my rep was destroyed. So, the escort job sort of fell into my lap, no pun intended.
neutral|Yeah, it does look pretty sweet, doesn't i- hey, screw you! Who asked you anyway? The crap I put up with...
neutral|It's a new and exciting frontier for our chef. I've never seen him so cheerful.
fear|Hey boss, can I ask you something?
neutral|It is my honor to bestow up on you the title of Paladin of the Brotherhood, for your meritorious service in its name.
neutral|No discounts for repeat customers... I think we did it before, anyways.
anger|
neutral|According to him, the NCR's decided enough's enough and's going to send in a mess of troops to take back the prison any day now.
neutral|Veronica put her moral sensibilities aside and supported the Brotherhood's new campaign of aggression as best she could.
neutral|It's about time. I saw some of the townies gathering at the saloon, so we've got a militia to take down. We get rid of them and we own this place.
joy|In her own way, of course, when she's not trying to wrangle my rangers into helping her.
neutral|Not much to live off of around here, except salvage from that factory. If they made off with anything expensive, we'd be hurting something fierce.
neutral|You did your part, so I'll do mine. Go ahead and root around up here if you want. I'm going to make a break for topside.
neutral|The Courier, who had a mixed history in the Wasteland, kept the status quo at Hoover Dam.
neutral|All right, but make it quick.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|Then'll we have to make you leave by force. Your own fault, you understand.
neutral|With Jacobstown's leadership destroyed, the remaining Super Mutants and Nightkin of the west scattered across the wasteland.
fear|It just seems a little twitchy. Some of these robots, you look at them the wrong way, don't screw in a vacuum tube right...
neutral|I'll let that slide seeing how you gotta mind full of vengeance for that no-good polecat and all.
joy|The NCR is out here to make the world a better place. For those out here and for all those back home. I'm glad I can be a part of that.
neutral|Folks who can't pay their way onto the Strip need a place to stay, too. And when Pretty Sarah set her whores up here, the Casa went full-service.
neutral|That leaves you. What do you say?
neutral|Letting you just walk away isn't how it works, I'm afraid.
neutral|I invited you here so we could talk, not so you can nose around.
neutral|I can't say that's something I treat all the time, but I should have something to help you through it.
anger|There's nothing "moderate" about the severity of this. And if you're going to make up names for diseases, come up with good ones.
neutral|The Courier, fair and kind-hearted to those in the Wasteland, ensured that Mr. House would keep New Vegas stable and secure for future generations.
sadness|Nipton wasn't the best towns, but...
neutral|After a campaign in which he denounced Oliver's and Kimball's hawkish, imperialist ways, Hanlon was elected as the senator of Redding.
neutral|Guess Gloria was wrong about you, then. Get out of here, you're no use to me.
neutral|Surprisingly good. Our forces have managed to secure the region with little resistance, and trade should soon reach an all-time high.
neutral|Still got them. 250 caps and they're yours.
neutral|You sure? Last chance to back out.
neutral|Can't help you, then. Medical supplies aren't cheap, you know.
neutral|The NCR mobilized its army and sent it east, to occupy Hoover Dam and restore it to working condition.
neutral|ED-E was eventually discovered by the Followers of the Apocalypse who managed to recover vast databanks of scientific knowledge.
neutral|The brass was particularly surprised by the lack of domestic threats in the area. They were prepared to spend months pacifying known troublemakers.
neutral|The land does not care about petty squabbles among lesser men. I don't care about that either.
neutral|Oh, shit, I don't know.  Got to be at least a month. Longer than I last at most jobs.
neutral|Damn it all to hell! Let's go!
neutral|You won't find better.
neutral|Oh, the usual reasons. People say he's enormous, carries a big sword, chops peoples' heads off. That's not what makes him a good commander, though.
neutral|Hey, I better get rolling. Jack and I have a lot of work ahead of us!
neutral|Kings hold control over the water pump 'round here.
neutral|Everything looks bigger than I imagined!
neutral|So what we do is take away the whole reason why they'd want to come back! Smart, huh?
neutral|This isn't the total we agreed upon. Don't waste my time, wastelander.
neutral|If you are listening to this log from one of our Enclave Outposts in Chicago, give this unit whatever repairs it needs so it can continue to Navarro.
neutral|After driving the Legion out of the Mojave Wasteland, the victorious NCR turned its attention to those who had allied themselves with Caesar.
neutral|One side will lose, and the other will win! But the side that wins will be weak, because a lot of its soldiers will be dead!
fear|Does it come with its own Deathclaw? Trust me, if you can't see it, something just as nasty's waiting.
neutral|Fuck you, NCR thugs! This is our land, and you won't last here forever!
neutral|Now get out of here!
neutral|See you when I see you.
neutral|Vacate the premises immediately. The casino is off-limits for 24 hours.
sadness|I don't know... There have been a couple...
neutral|After getting no help from them, a stranger at the end of the bar suggested the man make a sarsaparilla flavored drink.
neutral|If there's anybody left, they'd be in the Nipton Town Hall. Go there, check it out, let me know what you find.
neutral|Maybe it's best that I just say that he is a trooper, through and through. The man will not give up an inch for anything, least of all to the Legion.
anger|Grandma's limbs aren't doing too well, pumpkin.
neutral|Have a Vegas-style boxing ring in the center there.
neutral|And... it may also have been partly that our Elder at the time had worn out his welcome.
neutral|I'm wondering if our radio security codes have been compromised. I need someone to deliver security code upgrades to each of the Ranger stations.
neutral|Well, no idea why your friend Mr. House wants it, but I'm guessing it's not for the caps.
sadness|Well, that is great and all, but it's really against regulations.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Speak to me when you are ready and I'll have your weapons returned.
disgust|Got enough on my shoulders without adding more dead weight to 'em.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|You know what, you're new. Gloria's not going to miss you. And I'm not going to risk you saying the same thing to that bitch I'm hunting for.
neutral|Yeah.
neutral|After the NCR victory at Hoover Dam, the temporary truce between them and the Kings blossomed into a full-scale relief effort for the people.
neutral|When the patrols failed to return, we assumed the worst and sent a single communication to the scouts to hold position and maintain radio silence.
neutral|And because he fails to see that, he must be replaced.
neutral|I don't believe it. Who the hell are you, man? How did you just walk right up and pull him out of there?
neutral|Most of the chapter has been sealed in here for years, and those few who were outside when the lockdown was initiated are forbidden from returning.
neutral|We're at your service, if you need us. Until Driver Nephi is dead. Major's orders.
neutral|Yeah, beat it.
neutral|That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
neutral|Goddamn Legion.
neutral|Caesar's heirs aggressively pursued the Remnants into Arizona, losing hundreds of Legionaries in the process and gaining nothing in return.
sadness|Memories being short around here, not a whole lot of people remember them. But they did bad things. Terrorized communities, kidnapped people.
surprise|"High casualties?" We've had one broken ankle, but nobody at this post has died.
neutral|The Powder Gangers are no match for the battle-hardened troops of the NCR, and summary execution awaited the Powder Gangers who managed to survive.
joy|Hnh. I have seen little of true battle this day. And you were brave to come here to face me when all of NCR would not.
neutral|Sure. I want to establish a connection with the Followers first, but as far as I know, drifting is part of the job description.
neutral|Done.
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|Hardin's the type to fight to the last, and die rather than surrender. It's a good trait to have in a soldier, and a bad one to have in a leader.
neutral|Let's take this chump, guys!
disgust|Sure, boss. Whenever's good for you - I've probably got three, maybe four months before I keel over.
neutral|This thing on my head is headache medicine. It works real good, except I can't think when it's on. Really think, I mean.
neutral|Not a clue. When he left, I was too in my crib to understand why, and around the time Mom passed, I was too into my teens to listen.
sadness|Eventually, someone stopped them. I was born a few years later at a military base on the coast, a place called Navarro.
fear|Heh.
sadness|Besides, even if New Vegas eventually gets representation in the NCR senate, it's not like the NCR runs efficiently.
neutral|It's getting... dark.
neutral|First, we want to remain in control of Hoover Dam. It supplies the Republic with power, and is a source of fresh water.
neutral|I saved your life so I kinda feel responsible for you is all.
neutral|Really? Okay! That sounds fun!
neutral|Then I am sworn to report. I've been dividing my time between the camps to the north and south of here.
neutral|They suffered through water shortages, raider attacks, and the Brotherhood War. Like our mighty Sierra Nevadas, they endured.
neutral|The rumor is that the Legion is far larger than the NCR lets on, and that it's been due to luck that the Legion hasn't overrun the territory.
neutral|After the majority of the Vault 19 Powder Gangers joined the Great Khans, the weaker members scattered throughout the Mojave Wasteland.
anger|Keep your eyes to yourself, Legion asshole.
neutral|A client's got a right to privacy. So it'll cost 200 caps for me to tell you all about it.
neutral|Heard tell there was a Vault somewhere around here.
neutral|I figured as much.
joy|It is now. Me and the rest of the guys busted out of the NCR prison east of here and took over. Now we're calling the shots.
surprise|A fair point, but from the perspective of someone on the east side of Arizona, the man is clearly out of his mind.
neutral|Very well. I've been observing the penal facility there in the distance for some time now, after having followed some rather disturbing rumors.
neutral|
sadness|She went out to find some food one day. I was sick, so I stayed at our camp. I guess it must have been the beginnings of radiation poisoning.
fear|I've been wondering about Daisy and the others for so long, I still haven't figured out what I should do.
neutral|You got it! I won't say another word about them!
neutral|You're right. I'd be wrong to deny Jack such joy in his life.
neutral|You just had to go messing with my radio again, didn't you?
neutral|What's your rush? The boys and I here want to get to know you better.
neutral|It's the least I could do. All I ask is that you put it to good use. This place has lived in the shadow of Caesar for long enough.
neutral|Not much future in the Legion if you don't have a dick.
neutral|Okay. Well... good luck to you. I'm heading back to the Prospector. I could use a drink about now.
neutral|What'll fight on Blue?
neutral|
neutral|Yes! They're just as big as other mutants, and as strong as they look. Beyond that, uh...
anger|Head's ringing like an alarm clock.
neutral|Don't worry, you'll know him well when you serve him. Or you'll be dead.
sadness|We figured maybe we could find help in Mexico City - we were young, we didn't know what had happened, really. We didn't understand about the bombs.
sadness|Out of sight, out of mind. There are worse things one can be, though I do admit, it is a bit boring.
neutral|They got organized faster than I would have thought, most of them at least.
neutral|Have a nice day now, you hear?
fear|It can't be! How the hell...
neutral|Wait... wait a minute. Look. Some things in the NCR are... aren't ideal. But I want to help.
anger|Vale.
neutral|Dismissed.
disgust|No, and ain't looking to be a babysitter, neither.
anger|Make up your damn mind.
neutral|Only when it was sprung did they realize they were caught inside it, too. I only wish Vulpes had lived to see the scheme come to fruition.
neutral|The Garret Twins up at the Wrangler deserve mention. Wouldn't be right not mentioning the Van Graffs, I suppose.
neutral|Ask me to come with you, I'll think about it on the way.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
sadness|Can't believe we're in a refuge for crazy super mutants.
neutral|Well, now. An opportunity for payback after all these years. Johnson won't go along with it, though - he actually likes the NCR.
neutral|I hope you enjoyed this demonstration! You can come back up and see me or be on your way - I know you're a busy person!
neutral|If you had 200 caps, we could talk business - until then, we don't have anything to talk about.
neutral|You're looking at it. It's a watering hole without much to brag about.
neutral|If you're looking to sign on with a caravan, no - traders are bottled up tight here.
neutral|Until soon, I hope, outlander.
neutral|Great! So I've been looking over Mr. House's force projections and running some calculations...
neutral|What do you need, sugar?
neutral|Here you go. Let him know he needs to make another payment if he wants more of this stuff.
surprise|No, really. Have you ever snorted a ground up Cazador venom sac? Neither have I, but I can guarantee you that a Freeside junkie has.
neutral|Violence gave you that strength, awakened you - I can see it upon your face, where two bullets left their mark.
neutral|Now, the threat of legal action forces me to say that Nuka-cola is a swell beverage, but sometimes people just wanted something different, you know?
neutral|So there's just one more safe to crack? Hope you can get to it.
sadness|Thanks, I appreciate it.
disgust|Your reliance on comfort... it rots you from the inside. You are in need of the teachings the Legion will bring to your people.
neutral|Not much, other than they're a bunch of freeloaders who expected a few rounds on the house. I was able to get them to pay up, though.
neutral|Hey, wait up a moment. I can tell you're really upset that you didn't pass the test, so I'll let you take it again any time you want to come back.
neutral|I'm going to lay low for as long as I can, assuming the town doesn't throw me to the wolves. I've got no chance against the gang on my own.
neutral|We've received some disturbing reports from some of the Ranger stations - heavy casualties at Alpha, Super Mutant Legionaries at Delta.
surprise|Hmm. Wow. You sound like you really do need some help. Look, I can help you out, but you can't do anything stu-
neutral|The other snipers use bolt-action, but Gorobets reckoned it didn't matter none if I was different, so long as I can hit my targets.
neutral|Morale has plummeted as time has gone by, and many of our current paladins haven't even seen combat outside of training simulations.
neutral|Victor was a mixed blessing, however, as he continually monitored the town for Mr. House.
disgust|Love how he's decorated the place.
joy|In Boulder City, you let the renegade Khans go free, but left NCR troopers gurgling on the ground, drowning in their own blood.
disgust|Sure, boss. Whenever's good for you.
disgust|Fucking Mojave's going to hell, and all I can do is sit here and watch.
neutral|He refuses to see that our isolation is slowly weakening us. Aside from being our duty, going out on missions is what kept us strong.
neutral|Now then, it is my great honor to bestow upon you the title of Paladin of the Brotherhood, for meritorious service above and beyond the call of duty.
neutral|Look, I'm dead unless you can get me some real armor.
neutral|Wow! Do you have any idea how special that is? Red carpet treatment!
neutral|Tell Garret I'd be happy to start at the Wrangler immediately. This should be a nice change of pace from retirement.
neutral|Maybe some other time. I'm not really in the mood for a hike.
neutral|Hold me, will ya? I swear you wore me out...
disgust|I bet you could preach all day, who knows what other little bits of wisdom might spill out.
neutral|With Hanlon's plot against the occupation exposed and Oliver hailed as NCR's new war hero, many rangers were greeted coldly on their return home.
neutral|Yeah, it's a ways, though, hell of a detour. You sure?
sadness|I swore I was done with the gunslinging life - I was too old, too slow, and too beat up to protect anyone anymore.
neutral|Hey, look over there! It's those Mojave rats again, coming to take our water!
neutral|The Legion's tried to cross the water on a few occasions, but slow-moving boats make easy targets for sharpshooters.
neutral|Unless you can handle our supply shortages, the best we can do is scrape by in here in Freeside.
neutral|Now just hold on. I never voted to take on the Powder Gangers. That's a thousand cap investment you're talking about.
neutral|It hasn't been hard to track your progress. It's not as though you've been keeping a low profile.
neutral|If you can get these ropes off, I'll do my best to take down my share of the guards.
disgust|Fuck that. You can walk the road to hell on your own.
joy|Beams of light shot down from the sky over HELIOS One, killing who knows how many Profligate troops.
joy|Personally, no. But thanks to you, Julie says we're a lot better off these days. I'll take her word for it. So, thanks.
neutral|In the weeks that followed, several Bright Followers returned to Novac to help restore its defenses, allowing it to remain independent of NCR.
neutral|You're welcome to try. Its yours if you can get it working.
neutral|Don't mind trailblazing as long as we got the ammo. And whiskey.
neutral|Sure have. Camouflage, that coat was, trying to hide from extra terrestrials what can only see in black and white checkers.
neutral|Nevertheless, I have heard Caesar has a stately dignity about him. And I understand his policies will agree with our new menu.
neutral|Oh, hey, I almost forgot to tell you I heard a few things you might be interested in.
sadness|Hold on. If we're going to have this conversation, let's go somewhere more private.
neutral|In any event, I've recorded my findings in this report. Please deliver it to the Elder. I am sure he will find the contents most interesting.
neutral|Who knows? It might stay abandoned, get used as a base for raiders, or even become another colony for mutants.
neutral|Though independence for New Vegas was not all he hoped it could be, Arcade used his Enclave knowledge and technology to keep order wherever he could.
neutral|Not sure, let's look around.
neutral|That is a neat idea. I'll be the spotter. I'll find someone to play the target.
neutral|However, the first generation seems to have some kind of suicidal urge that they can't control.
neutral|Okay, let's get the fuck out of here. What the hell are you waiting for? You think I want to get shot?  Let's go!
surprise|I don't know Technical Sergeant Reyes, but coordinating intel can be messy sometimes. Things get mixed up, people get confused.
neutral|But the time came when they could no longer shoulder the burden alone.
neutral|I'm afraid she'll ditch Usanagi early if she feels its taking too long - she won't want to look bad in the eyes of the rest of First Recon.
neutral|Somewhere along the way, he realized he needed to educate the Blackfoots or they were going to get wiped out with the rest of the tribe.
anger|Like you have a clue what that even means.
surprise|I'm not familiar with that condition. Is it treatable?
neutral|Right now Beagle is the closest Primm's got to any organized law, but he's still stuck up in Bison Steve.
joy|As far as fruitless wastes of time go, it's quite noble in its aims.
neutral|Looking to step on your own grave?
joy|Your bravery surpasses that of any other, and I've come to admire your actions.
neutral|When it was all over, the guards were dead and we were free. Most of the other prisoners scattered, but a few of us stuck around, obviously.
neutral|I'm in quite a state here. If you help me with my bonds I'll be more than happy to tell you anything, and everything about those Khans.
neutral|Can't say I've seen a smile on anyone's face since we arrived.
neutral|The desert can play tricks on a man's mind. Don't let it bother you overmuch.
neutral|I believe that the mutants here are generally considered to dislike humans. And nothing could be further from the truth.
neutral|Primm Slim proves to be an able-minded, if not able-bodied, sheriff for Primm.
disgust|You talk like glory is a hollow, meaningless thing. Maybe to you it is, but not to the Great Khans.
neutral|He was prepared to make the most noble of sacrifices, to defend the principles of our republic, even here, on Nevada soil.
neutral|Is this a trick question? I don't even see a scratch on you.
neutral|Well, the dam here is the key to helping the NCR make the world a better place.
neutral|He sent you? Why?
neutral|Each clutched his ticket, hoping it would set him free. Each did nothing, even when "loved ones" were dragged away to be killed.
neutral|She'd be cross with me if I didn't ask you to poke your head in and say hi.
neutral|This doesn't feel quite right, but it resolves things and gets my troopers back in one piece.
neutral|We must strike while our enemies are distracted with each other.
neutral|Done.
disgust|Have a nice life.
sadness|I can't leave now. Caesar has gained too much ground. I need to be here in case the NCR fails to hold Hoover Dam.
neutral|This print-out describes the situation in more detail!
neutral|On Caesar's orders, the Burned Man was covered in pitch by the Praetorian Guard, lit on fire, and cast into the Grand Canyon.
neutral|There's usually a gun merchant hanging around topside. I'm sure she'll take care of you.
neutral|I already told you, I don't want to talk about it.
anger|Gonna lose a limb if I don't get some meds.
neutral|Would you mind if I looked at the message you found?
neutral|Someone thought it would be fun to put graffiti up everywhere. At least I don't have to clean it up.
neutral|I am Vulpes Inculta, of Caesar's Legion. I serve my master as the greatest of his Frumentarii.
neutral|Whole Lucky 38... the idea that there's this casino in the middle of a town of people, and only you're ever let inside?
neutral|Well, as long as those companies were run by men. And that's the biggest issue I see.
neutral|I think your eyes will see more than I could ever tell you. Take your time. Enjoy the sights.
neutral|Last word I had from the office, it looked like payment had been received for the other five jobs. Guess it was just your chip that didn't make it.
joy|I shall honor your last words and face you alone. No man will say I refused your challenge.
neutral|All right, let it be so. The Brotherhood will have to be dealt with eventually, but for the moment, they live to serve.
sadness|I never killed anybody, but I had my share of run-ins with the police. Mostly my family kept me in line.
neutral|You're right. The Great Khans are free to go.
neutral|T-That is unfortunate. As long as there is a chance to find the remaining patrol, however, I must still ask you to try.
neutral|Caesar is the salvation of mankind, his Legion the rebirth of civilization in a benighted age.
neutral|It was a while ago! He came through in a real hurry - didn't even stop to say hello! I think he went down his secret escape elevator out in the hall!
neutral|Good man. He's one of the Followers of the Apocalypse. He's the one who taught people around here how to start growing crops.
anger|You're lucky if you turn a profit sometimes if some new officer gets assigned a route, the fees just get worse.
neutral|Spare some ammo?
neutral|The Lucky 38 will be your grave. I'll finish what Benny couldn't get right!
neutral|I might know something. 'Bout 100 caps worth of something, let's say?
surprise|You're not kidding. You're in bad shape, friend. I'd be happy to fix you up... for a reasonable fee.
neutral|I'll hold up here, don't be long.
neutral|I happen to have something perfectly suitable in mind, though I warn you - it won't be easy. Still interested?
neutral|There's something I like about you. You just seem really understanding. I was gonna ask you for a favor, but I'll just tell you what you wanna know.
neutral|Send me all the Legion you can. I'll be waiting for them.
neutral|You may have seen them around somewhere yourself. Now, deny your hunger no longer!
neutral|Cannibalism was strictly forbidden in their contract. If some of them broke that stricture, they deserved whatever punishment you dealt them.
anger|Sure, if you're a sociopath.
anger|I'll just have to do it for him.
anger|It may be that no one's traded with them or even spoken to them that entire time. If so, they're sitting on one hell of a stockpile of ammunition...
neutral|We're getting caught up in something important out here. Hell, after how you handled Benny, you're practically right in the middle of all this.
neutral|I feel really bad telling you this, but I kind of... can't die. I mean, go ahead and destroy this Securitron, get it out of your system!
neutral|Done.
neutral|True. All right. The first try was a little less "professional". Someone important on the Strip had access to some of House's technology.
neutral|You are a Courier, hired by the Mojave Express to deliver a package to the New Vegas Strip.
neutral|Criminal scum that've infested this region, attacking caravans and regular folk just passing through.
disgust|When I recovered - more or less, anyways - I left Tuscon and headed west. I ran into Tabitha at Black Mountain and, well, the rest you know.
neutral|What can I get you?
neutral|But if we recruited Knights from outside the group, maybe we could actually defend it.
neutral|Good. That's damn good. I figure it's about time we got lucky out here, so maybe you can snuff one of these maniacs.
joy|Folks around here call me the chief, but Hanlon's just fine. The rangers run themselves pretty well, but I try to lend a hand.
neutral|Yeah, boss?
neutral|Thanks to the Courier and Lily, a cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia was found shortly after Doctor Henry's experiment concluded.
neutral|Anyway, I was just going to tell you that I've come across some new tidbits you might find interesting.
neutral|But I've come up with a fairly simple way to tell who's lying. You up to taking a little test?
sadness|I see. Well, thank you for trying. I'm off to go see my admirer now.
neutral|Well, I'll give you a hint - they used to just call me Gibson. I hope you can figure out the rest.
anger|Enough.
anger|And if you say "no," keep in mind what that means. NCR may have its problems, but when we're riled, watch out.
neutral|One of our exploratory patrols - back when we had exploratory patrols - found a data disc in some ruins out in the waste.
joy|Heh, yeah good old Klamath. Not a bad place if you like hunting, eating, and skinning geckos all day! Heh heh.
neutral|Mostly traders looking to buy Bighorner meat and hides. The traders are the main reason the general store manages to stay in business.
anger|Well, yeah! Right. What did I expect? The man's a megalomaniac. He acts like this is some pre-ordained cycle we're returning to.
neutral|None of this means a thing if the rest of the group doesn't show up, though.
joy|We keep the Great Khans from falling apart, essentially. Jack manufactures the chems, I organize the runners and the shipments.
neutral|Yes, and herded them to the center of town. I told them their sins, the foremost being disloyalty.
neutral|Bullshit. What anybody else would've done is get their asses killed. You're leading some kind of charmed life.
sadness|My mother never told me what happened to my father, but she and I went south with some others and integrated into the NCR.
neutral|Will you drive away the demons, wanderer?
joy|Are you kidding me? Never felt better!
anger|Back here again?
neutral|Great! So I've been looking over Mr. House's force projections and running some calculations...
neutral|What did you have in mind?
neutral|This print-out covers everything you need to know!
neutral|Since he's dead, I don't think he'll mind. Here.
neutral|Way I see it, salvage means it's broken, near-worthless. Me, I looked for the good stuff - guns, chems, spare parts. Good money in it.
joy|That's great to hear, really great. I am Sheldon, from Vault 21, although here I go by my artistic name, "Michael Angelo."
neutral|Thank you. Thank you.
neutral|Aw, you shouldn't have! It's just my taste. Thank you.
neutral|An opinion you expressed with supreme subtlety and finesse. Moving on...
neutral|Alright, you look pretty trustworthy.
anger|Hell, I can even deal with the puke in the latrines. But I can't stand the smell of turpentine, fuck that!
neutral|Why should we support Vegas? They've locked Freeside out of the city and do nothing to help their neighboring townsfolk.
neutral|Like I said - 200 caps to hear all about it.
anger|So if NCR comes at you, and it will, pray you're ready. I promise you, our situations reversed, I'd see you hang.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|All this time, my Securitrons have had to get by running the Mark I operating system, which lacked software drivers for their primary weapons!
neutral|A perfectly satisfactory way of resolving the threat they posed. It's impressive that you made it through their barrage.
anger|People back home don't listen. They don't care. Senators, Brahmin barons, folks who are just trying to make it from day to day.
sadness|Why free me now? After what you done? I ain't saying thank you.
joy|Well, one day the signal stops, so I figured I'd try to find transmitter. I'm a pretty good repairman, or I was before the eyes started to go.
neutral|Don't know, not sure where to head to next.
anger|If that's the best you can muster, then it's you who should be backing up slow, and your buddies with you.
neutral|On better days I help keep the peace. Boone and Vargas watch the road, I watch the town. Tell myself I'm doing some good.
fear|Does it? Does it?
anger|Yes, but at significant cost. I understand that you not only agreed that the company pay off his gambling debts, but he also gets severance.
anger|The West shall fall as the East fell, and all the tribes that stretch to the setting sun shall bear the mark of the Legion.
neutral|Right. Moving on, then.
neutral|I guess I can spare a minute or two for you. Things are a little slow at the moment anyway.
neutral|But the only resource we got here is junk. Without that, people wouldn't have anything to trade. They'd all have to leave.
neutral|Eventually, the NCR tried to put the prisoners down, but they were overwhelmed by them, and haven't sent troops to the area since.
neutral|There's me, but I don't really like talking about myself. There's Julie Farkas and the other Followers down at the ol' Mormon Fort.
neutral|Didn't have much choice, I'm afraid. But I understand the sentiment.
neutral|What? Let me see that.
disgust|NCR and their goddamn nicknames, as if Caesar himself's gonna piss and run if he hears them.
anger|You don't get it, do you? The weapons I wield are forged from blood, flesh, sinew, bone - mortal stuff. Fragile, even.
neutral|With brutal methods that few in NCR would approve of, it was the Courier who secured NCR's victory at Hoover Dam.
neutral|That's right, the H&H Tools factory on the main drag. It's been sealed for ages, and it's lousy with traps. Still, might be something valuable to you.
fear|I have to say I don't understand where you're going with Mr. House. The man's been manipulating the locals for as long as anyone can remember.
neutral|Tabitha was grandma's squad leader when we both worked for the Master. She wasn't very nice at all, but she was good at the chopping.
neutral|<Makes beeping sounds>
joy|I'm a master at repairing things, so I check in every so often to make sure all the equipment here is in top working condition.
neutral|Also, before I forget, here is a key to a safehouse you can use to rest if you happen to be in the area. I'll just mark it mark it on your map.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Male, Evil Karma.
neutral|Damn! And she looks good to me, too.
neutral|Travelers from the Republic quickly learned to avoid Freeside if they valued their safety.
neutral|We held this place for years, kicked one Legate out of here so hard Caesar burned him to a crisp. It's our post, we've fought for it.
neutral|I'm not surprised. Whip out your caps and away we go.
neutral|An army like that should be enough to defend Vegas from - heck, anybody!
neutral|Well, I was thinking I might set this bunker up as a safehouse. Between the remote location and the dust storms, I figured it was ideal.
neutral|Wonderful. Then let's begin making a whole new you!
neutral|If it's all right, I'd like to head that way. Meet some people, see if I can be of any use.
neutral|You are free to come and go as you please, though I hope you'll return to us someday in a more permanent capacity.
neutral|Do this job for me, though, I'll do what I can. People know I hate most everyone, so if I put in a word for you... that's gold.
neutral|Not in Goodsprings, no. But if you're up for a little scavenging, there's always the schoolhouse.
neutral|Despite distinguishing themselves during the second Battle of Hoover Dam, the rangers' victory was short-lived due to the Courier's interference.
neutral|I'm afraid those are the rules. If you don't like it you can take your business elsewhere.
neutral|Without the organization of Motor-Runner, Cook-Cook, Violet, and Driver Nephi, they were easy prey.
neutral|No, let "Courier Six" carry the package, that's what he said - like the Mojave'd sort you out or something. Then he just up and walked out.
neutral|Maybe, depends on how my girl's feeling.
neutral|I need a snakebite kit, fast.
neutral|Something that's eye-catching and sexy, but also says "don't fuck with me."
anger|You dare speak that name? Comparing him to any man of Caesar will only earn you a slow death.
neutral|I'd rather not allow more outsiders in, but I'll hear you out.
neutral|Tumble-whats?
neutral|I'll roll over to the Lucky 38 and see what I can do. If I'm right about the Platinum Chip, I should be able to install myself on House's mainframe!
neutral|Bolstered by ancient knowledge of governance, economics, and transportation, they carved a mighty empire out of the ruins of the Northwest.
neutral|Couldn't tell you much more than that. Not really one for New Vegas when there's enough dumpwater bars in the Mojave to last me.
neutral|I'm Jane, one of Mr. House's girls. We keep him... entertained. We don't get many guests lately; perhaps we can entertain you as well.
neutral|Shaped up by the Courier's advice, the Misfits distinguished themselves during the Legion's attack on Camp Golf.
neutral|All right, then - I'll show up at this gathering of yours. It might be good to see the others - Johnson excluded.
joy|I took it - not like anybody else needed it, you know? - and wore it back to our camp. Rafaela laughed for the first time since the bombs had fallen.
sadness|No... no, I know. Just hard to say how I feel right now.
neutral|Arcade might've mentioned there's a pass phrase needed to get into the bunker - my part is "Remember."
neutral|I expect you to treat my Rexie with a little more care. I'm expecting him back now, you hear?
neutral|I'm disappointed with this outcome, but what's done is done. At least we're rid of Henry.
fear|All right... don't be long. Robots there give me the creeps.
neutral|Mental trauma can be just as debilitating as physical injuries. Fortunately, I'm well-qualified in such treatment. I'll make time in my schedule.
neutral|But you backed me, even when the odds were against us. Words aren't enough, but - thanks.
sadness|Should we cut the people down...
anger|Quit wasting my time.
disgust|Rubble city, more like it.
neutral|Has this person's condition worsened? What are the symptoms?
neutral|New Vegas finally has soldiers worthy of protecting it!
neutral|I don't know, I'm a little like both of them I guess. If I had to choose, I really don't know which I'd pick.
neutral|Military operations are classified information. The brass is familiar with the situation at the NCRCF.
neutral|Torres must be getting desperate if she's accepting help on this one. I'll tell you what I told her.
neutral|You should take some time off. You've earned it.
neutral|I much prefer working with robots...
neutral|Mr. House looked on these actions favorably, seeing them as proof of the Kings' loyalty to New Vegas, and decided to leave them alone.
surprise|I'm really very boring. You'd get better stories out of a Freeside junkie.
neutral|I reckon I'll stick around awhile, patrol for troublemakers, see if I can get that radio working.
neutral|The rest of us, though - we were just trying to civilize things. The NCR was still new and it didn't look like they'd last all that long.
neutral|Get it over with, will you?
anger|If you want to go off half-cocked and leave a trail of corpses in your wake, that's your business. We'll do our best to clean up your mess.
neutral|However, I do have another task that fits the bill rather nicely. Would you consider undertaking it?
neutral|Well, I don't know. Depends on if you can make it worth my time. A hundred caps sounds right to me.
neutral|You haven't decided - well, this is just getting better every second, isn't it?
disgust|When I recovered - more or less, anyways - I left Tuscon and headed west. I ran into Tabitha at Black Mountain and, well, the rest you know.
neutral|Humans are always staring at things. We Nightkin don't like being stared at. Is is... uncomfortable.
joy|Of course, please, take this! We carried as much useful technology as we could, before our journey into the surface world.
neutral|The OS upgrade also includes drivers for our onboard auto-repair systems! Just try to hurt us now!
anger|The sheriff here ain't worth a damn.
neutral|I operate the radio and call it in if we see any Great Khans moving out in large groups from Red Rock Canyon.
neutral|I'd noticed Snuffles limping, but I didn't realize the problem was that serious. Thanks - that beast helps keep spirits up around here.
neutral|Some eventually found their way to Jacobstown, but many wandered off into the wastes, confused and disheartened.
neutral|Off the road, you'll probably start running into hostile wildlife. My advice would be to stick to the highway when you can.
neutral|There you are! A few of us wanted to thank you for being such a good friend to the Brotherhood, so we've set aside some of our recycled energy cells.
joy|Cass survived to see the NCR flag flying proud over Hoover Dam, and thought for a moment... this is what a hero must feel like.
neutral|They followed us down there, but we were out before they realized what was happening.
neutral|
neutral|There's talk from time to time about taking out their base at Red Rock Canyon, but nothing ever comes of it. The Great Khans are tough fighters.
joy|Me? I've been in the military my entire life. It's a family sort of thing. My father served, my brothers serve, and I serve.
neutral|Thought I recognized the fellow with you. So, what's this reunion all about, then?
neutral|You need anything else?
neutral|Like I told you, we work salvage. We aren't coyotes. And like I told you, fuck off.
neutral|For the past hundred years or so, the Followers have managed to get by using salvaged medical supplies from the Old World.
sadness|I do, but I'm tired of telling them. Time changes how you look at things.
neutral|Oh, you'll need my word from the pass phrase to get into the bunker - "friends." Don't forget it.
neutral|Not much other than the Brahmin being chased down the street. That's a little unusual even for the Strip.
neutral|Hey, look over there! It's those Mojave rats again, coming to take our water!
neutral|He and his crew went north. I heard talk about some sort of "big plan" to get back at the NCR, but haven't seen them since.
anger|Sorry, but I won't be sticking around to see if you have the courtesy to lay flowers on the mass grave that the Legion's going to dig for them.
disgust|I see you fight with words, like all beneath the flag of the bear. Let us hope your skill with weapons proves greater.
disgust|Statues of two men shaking hands covered in blood don't seem to be nothing to brag about.
neutral|See Senior Knight Lorenzo for the details. He's the one who brought the matter to my attention, and the only other person who is aware of it.
neutral|Return when you have found them.
joy|We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
surprise|Well if it wasn't before, it is now.
neutral|Caesar's death is regrettable, but we can't let it stand in the way of the Legion's goals.
neutral|I've already talked to Anderson, actually. Came in, confessed, and gave you credit for the whole thing.
neutral|And a lesser person might want that kind of overwhelming force on their side, but you know - where's the challenge in that?
neutral|Heard there's still mines in the city - and maybe drunk NCR soldiers spoiling for a fight.
neutral|Those brave or foolish to remain were killed or crucified by the merciless Legionaries.
neutral|Done.
neutral|There once was a man of stout heart... heart, heart, what rhymes with heart?
neutral|It is Caesar's will this gate to the West bear the flag of the Legion. Caesar's will shall be done.
neutral|There's a move we have in the Rangers for knocking an opponent off his feet. Saved my butt a bunch of times, maybe it will for you too.
neutral|Then why are you wasting my time?
joy|Well, I don't got any work right now, sorry to say.
neutral|After generations of being beaten down, the Great Khans were finally broken by the Courier.
neutral|Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! Look what they're wearing! I've only seen dresses like those in my dreams. And even then I couldn't afford them.
neutral|New Vegas has many faces, stranger. Despite everything, it shall never be whole.
anger|Payback's a bitch, ladies, and between Gloria and Alice, that settles accounts, as far as I'm concerned.
neutral|If NCR or anybody else is looking for an excuse to attack Jacobstown, they're not going to get it from us.
neutral|The Legion's aggression will outlive Caesar. Indeed, they'll try to take the dam as a tribute to his memory.
neutral|Yes, that's the stuff. And the container's shielding must be intact, or you'd be dead by now.
neutral|Heard this used to be a mine field from some of the troopers here.
disgust|Many graves in the East are filled with those who said as much, with braver words, not backed by strength.
neutral|They continued to be a nuisance throughout Outer Vegas, but never established full control over the area.
fear|You make an excellent point. I never liked that Cachino fuck anyway. Here you go.
neutral|Roughneck prospector is all I hear, good at what he does. Been renting a room here for a year or so - nothing special.
neutral|The NCR mounted an attack not long ago but they just used regular troops - no rangers - so that didn't amount to anything.
neutral|Done.
neutral|The Courier, cruel and merciless, had ensured that Mr. House would maintain complete control over New Vegas and everyone in it.
neutral|First saw this place, thought the giant gecko was real.
neutral|All of this, you probably already knew...
neutral|Sure. Pearl gave the green light. Take a look at the manifest.
anger|My name is Raul Alfonso Tejada. Can I leave now, or did you want to ask me again in five minutes?
neutral|Hmm. I remember that Benny used to pay a receptionist at Gomorrah for information - maybe she knows something!
neutral|I could use a Doctor's Bag if you have any handy.
neutral|Before you get your Ranger badge, you've got to prove you can be quieter than a shadow and more ferocious than a Deathclaw.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Cocky, aren't you? Oh well, your call.
neutral|There's a bar in the intact section, careful if you go wandering around the ruined section.
neutral|Anyway, pendant's a little rose. Originally thought it was one of Mom's tribal necklaces, but no, came from Dad.
neutral|And who says I couldn't survive just as well as you out there? People are always underestimating me, damn.
neutral|I've been there once, and I don't recommend it. It's just a way to burn through a month's pay in five minutes.
anger|Disturb me again and I'll have you killed!
neutral|It's been so bad I asked Sergeant Reyes at Camp Forlorn Hope to look into it and see how it is that things could be so fouled up there.
neutral|As for Dad, I figure he just got himself lost or dead. Happens... and I'm not all boo-hoo about it, so save your glass for someone who's crying.
neutral|I just know what I've heard. There's supposed to be some ghouls that went in a while back.
neutral|Which reminds me, you don't even know how to use these, do you?
neutral|You must not know a lot about my family or you wouldn't have asked that. The Van Graffs and the NCR have been enemies for decades.
neutral|You settle things with him, help the others around here, too, I'll sign the paper if it means getting out of here.
joy|This is just the start, you see. This is where it all begins.
sadness|Creating fear and instability among the troopers without causing harm, it's the only thing I could think of to shake things up.
fear|Ring-a-ding-ding, baby. I've got your back.
neutral|Bye.
neutral|Caused total chaos among the younger legionaries, and Oliver's troopers fell back to the side walkways and stayed out of the veterans' way.
neutral|I see. Well, I'll take that under advisement.
neutral|Couple of years now. I was a trader for awhile, but got tired of all the walking. Westside was a good place to settle down as any.
disgust|This has been a fuck of a day.
anger|Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to walk out that door and pretend we never had this talk.
neutral|Looks like that guy's headed this way. Don't screw it up.
neutral|Nothing yet, but... something's there. Just got to look around and find it.
neutral|Err... yeah. It was a long time ago. Things were better back then.
neutral|We've talked Torres into giving you access to gear for a little cheaper, to help out with your travels. Hope it helps!
neutral|Which surgery option are you considering?
neutral|I think so. Two things the Brotherhood has a lot of - hardheads and lasers. Wouldn't be the first time a disagreement ended like this.
surprise|What's that hum?
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|I'm pretty sure I dropped in when we made our escape. We had been surrounded and had climbed up on this big rock to hold them off.
sadness|Yeah. Yeah. Thought as much. He'd been fading away for a long time.
neutral|Though many Great Khans mourned the death of their tribe, many more were ultimately satisfied with their revenge against NCR.
neutral|Negotiating an allotment of power from Hoover Dam was crucial. That's what's powered the Strip for the past seven years.
anger|Go bug someone else with your questions.
sadness|You wouldn't think a man of god could turn so brutal. Cruel to his opponents. Did the sort of things that make you sick to talk about.
neutral|Yep. That's poison.
neutral|So let's bring you up to speed, shall we?
neutral|Yes, extremely so. They must use conditioning routines on par with the rangers, or better.
anger|I said, take care of the Brotherhood. Then we talk - maybe.
disgust|They have no vision. They offer no future. They're a dead end.
sadness|I can't say I understand your obsession, but for that I suppose I'd have to spend a night in your grave.
neutral|It turns out there's only one way for us to win this battle and make it stick! We have to render Hoover Dam inoperable!
neutral|Some squatters decided to take space where they don't belong, over by the playground. We'd prefer to keep 'em off the streets and out of sight.
neutral|See? Not so hard is it?
anger|Leo, I think we're in very big trouble!
sadness|I'm too old to be slapping leather, but I had hoped for something else. More than this, anyway.
joy|I was, once. We were pretty young, but I like to think it was love.
disgust|Oh, "last you looked," huh? Yeah, we'll take another look... after you haul ass outta here.
neutral|Most of the Kings were killed, with the few survivors driven out into the wastes.
neutral|I'm retired, but life has been a bit dull without some kind of action. What's the job?
neutral|And when that happens, it will be good to have the Brotherhood as an ally. Good enough?
neutral|If I or one of the others hears that you're topside, we might just come out and have a little chat.
neutral|You've certainly earned the right, but I'm afraid there's a slight matter of protocol that must be dealt with first.
anger|That's it. I'm out. Good luck getting out of this place without being shot to pieces by NCR soldiers, assuming they aren't going to fry to death.
neutral|I haven't had a drink all day! Screw this place, I'll go spend my money elsewhere!
anger|The West's treatment of bitches such as you is their weakness. But... by my honor, I shall face you alone, as you request.
neutral|I like to keep things simple. Just focus on now. That's why they made me a sniper.
neutral|sore throat,
neutral|
sadness|Not much different from how the rangers used to be, except with books and medicine instead of guns.
neutral|Some convicts from the prison up the road have taken over the town. Everyone inside is either dead or in hiding.
neutral|With no clear leader to guide efforts in Freeside, the Followers of the Apocalypse lost control of Old Mormon Fort to local thugs and junkies.
fear|It can't be! How the hell...
neutral|The next morning, the sheriff stopped by and reported that the stranger's body was found on the side of the town road. He'd been killed by bandits.
neutral|This is most unusual! The Powder Gangers have visitors today. I guess there's a first for everything!
neutral|Grandma will be right here if you need anything, pumpkin!
neutral|A decanus named Dead Sea took the place and caused a lot of damage.
neutral|Fully half of our forces had already fallen. I gathered up those I could find and we fought our way here.
neutral|I guess I could track them if I needed to, but the town of Primm needs me here, to serve and protect.
neutral|The colonel is an effective commander - one of the best - but she sharpened her claws on the Vipers and the old Jackals.
neutral|I don't think they've gotten the trains up and running yet, but most of the concrete plant workers have come back to town now. Good for business.
neutral|I could use a syringe of Med-X or two. Or eight.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|You've seen that with your own two eyes?
neutral|Dynamite. Lots and lots of dynamite. You should've seen the body parts flying everywhere.
neutral|As reward for their loyal service, Caesar forcibly integrated the Great Khans into the Legion.
neutral|We were able to decrypt the data and discovered that it was just messages from the virus's writer, taunting his victims.
neutral|Now that's over with, I'd send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope, but I heard it's overrun by the Legion. Bastards.
neutral|Check that out! He just left the Lucky 38!
neutral|
neutral|However, this turn of events could also be an opportunity. We mostly left the equipment of the communications array there alone, out of respect.
neutral|Okay.
neutral|Oh, don't you worry your silly little head about that, pumpkin. Grandma knows what she's doing.
neutral|Come to the Silver Rush for all your energy weapon needs!
neutral|It was the Dam, really. We'd heard rumors it was working. Figured we could claim it, put it to use.
neutral|The Republic shall keep their Old World gate this day, I shall return East. When I return, I shall have all the armies of the Legion with me.
neutral|We get most of it up the road from the old rocket test site. But a bunch of ghouls showed up one day and took it over. We can't get in there now.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|I killed Corporal White to protect Westside's self-reliance. It was rash, and I regret it now.
surprise|Don't understand how the missiles could have missed a target like this.
anger|But you - of all people - dare to come here and stand before me, the mighty Caesar. What were you thinking?
neutral|Roger.
neutral|
neutral|Thanks.
neutral|Could you bring your robot to one of our patrols so they can examine it? I'll have the robot mark the location on your map.
neutral|I told the Rangers up at the station to keep an eye out, but there's just too much ground out there for them to cover.
neutral|She upset a lot of people. You wouldn't have liked her, either.
neutral|Maybe you are and maybe you aren't, but I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
neutral|You don't listen too well, do you? We're supposed to pat everyone down. That's going in my report.
neutral|<whimper>
neutral|No, I heard you quite clearly. You're being sent off to be killed like the others.
neutral|The saloon owner went on to become rich selling the new drink, and to this day some bottles of Sunset Sarsaparilla have a blue star under their caps.
sadness|I think that settles accounts with me - and my men. That was some tricky political maneuvering, but worth it, even if it takes a few years.
anger|Caesar's health worsens, and your indecision is unhelpful.
anger|NCR's senate has got funds tied up at the Boneyard and President Kimball ordered our most experienced rangers to chase ghosts down in Baja.
neutral|I myself often wish we could end this interminable stasis and begin moving forward again.
fear|Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
neutral|...There, I think you've got the knack of it now. You should now be able to wear any kind of power armor you come across.
anger|First deadbeat we hired to do the job canceled. Hope a storm from the Divide skins him alive. Well, that's where you came in.
neutral|Ranger Station Alpha. Ranger Lineholm is in command here.
neutral|Once had a King following me like I was following you - had to chase him off with a shotgun finally.
surprise|I was just looking for something I could slice up to wrap my burns when I saw the vaquero outfit hanging on the rack, like it hadn't been touched.
neutral|Get me some ingredients out of the Mojave, an empty bottle, a little time, and I'll keep us stocked.
neutral|He's clean.
neutral|An assault on this place would be suicide.
sadness|Just doesn't feel right, trading history for a slip of paper.
neutral|It's moderately defensible, with a single point of entry on the east side. To get to the power plants below, the enemy has to cross the entire top.
neutral|Guy's unstable, but he pays his rent and Sweetie seems to like him all right.
neutral|
neutral|Was reminded why I left this place soon as I walked in. Let's go.
neutral|I hope you weren't thinking we were going to take the lead. That's no job for a bunch of graybeards. Or grayheads, in Whitman's case.
neutral|Oh, we will, sugar. We will.
neutral|Not that I mind being friends, it's just being open about it in the Outpost... well, I have to work here.
neutral|But if Kimball dies at Hoover Dam, there's no obvious scapegoat for them to blame! So they'll blame New Vegas instead!
neutral|Oh, I know. I was only a boy when they went through hell together. I'm glad you're helping me reunite them.
joy|You're kicking me into gear, huh? I think I'll drive my chassis over to your pad. Wait for me down there, and don't forget the oil.
neutral|Something tells me we better enjoy this breather while we can... and if that means Vegas, then you and the troops have earned it.
neutral|Everything you see is funded by the Followers of the Apocalypse. We rely a lot on charity to provide low-cost medical services to the less fortunate.
neutral|Screw it. Just shoot! They'll get the hint!
neutral|Can't say we spoke much. Boone did most of the buying for them. She was in the store once, but she didn't stay long.
neutral|Half a year or so. The Casa's a dump and Marco's a pig, but Pretty Sarah makes sure I don't get hassled.
sadness|If you lose your humanity, then I suppose that is all that's left.
neutral|Wish we got paid in caps, though. Not a lot of merchants like taking NCR paper money.
neutral|Okay, see you around.
neutral|Now we can actually start fresh. Thank you for helping us.
neutral|I'm pretty sure the NCR wants to hold onto the Dam because it's one of the few places around that can make electricity.
neutral|Heading up!
neutral|Okay, well let me know what she says.
neutral|Way to keep your head, rookie. There's hope for you yet.
neutral|Then that's the plan. We're going to have a problem with Moreno, though. He won't like that we're helping the NCR - you'll have to talk to him.
neutral|No job was too violent, no target too innocent. As long as the caps were good, Boone would take the job.
joy|Oh, this old thing? Why, thanks, friend. This here guitar is just about the only thing my daddy left me.
neutral|So where to?
anger|Ahh, Rafaela... I'll see you soon.
neutral|During the attack on Hoover Dam, Chief Hanlon and his rangers threw themselves into the path of the Legion assault, dying to the last man and woman.
neutral|Put the bomb in one of the vents inside the train on the back wall, towards the joint that connects the cars.  Arm it, and get out of there.
neutral|But Caesar punishes homosexuality with death, and we nearly got caught, and there were suspicions. So when he took me out into the desert...
joy|Hnh. Then when I return, woman of the West... we shall see if your belief will withstand the blades of the Legion.
neutral|Oh yes, he's been trying for quite some time. Hardin has been strongly opposed to the lockdown from the first. It goes against his nature, you see.
neutral|Like a lot of the Followers, he went out in the wilderness with a partner to try to help those who needed helping.
neutral|I got business here, need to watch the shop, make sure things are running - smoothly.
neutral|You, over there! Go back where you came from, thieves! Don't try our patience!
neutral|You want someone dead? Really dead? Stop by the Silver Rush and we'll give you the means!
surprise|You claim that word of my coming has been given to the West so that I might die here... even as I take the Dam?
neutral|You can find him in the main embassy building inside the gate and to your left.
disgust|Whatever you say, boss. I'll just stay back here and be quiet in case you have a sudden flash of brilliance you need to share.
neutral|I know that... thing... as much as anyone else around here. It mostly keeps to itself, which is just fine by me.
neutral|Waited too long to finish this, last loose end, all wrapped up.
neutral|There are a lot of dangerous things out in the desert, and you won't have me with you to protect you, as I need to stay here and keep Primm safe.
neutral|Bad suit, huh? Well, if assholes had taste, we'd all be feasting on shit.
neutral|He hated their casino, said it was tacky! And he thought they were up to something, because he said they always are!
disgust|Though I guess what I think never really mattered much to you, did it?
fear|Maybe he just left instructions for his robots to carry out in his name.
neutral|If you wander around the wasteland you'll find all sorts of tribes, villages, and such where people spend most of their time trying to survive.
neutral|This shouldn't be too much work. Try to sit still.
surprise|A man of potential, held back by the craven political context he inhabits. You realize he was a general? "The Hero of the Mojave," they called him.
neutral|Looks like this place got wrecked.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Well, I don't know about you, but to me that sounds like a man who's willing to cooperate. Except he hasn't.
neutral|I... don't want to talk about it.
neutral|Such as?
fear|The Brotherhood hoards knowledge and is obviously a smidge more violent than the Followers.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|We'll see.
neutral|Might as well be throwing rocks.
joy|Maybe... yeah. I guess you've got a point there.
neutral|A new type of mutant was created - stronger, faster, smarter, more dangerous in every way.
neutral|It's been decades, you know. By now, he's been out of the Enclave longer than he was in.
neutral|Private First Class Jeremy Watson, on behalf of the senate and people of the New California Republic,
neutral|Guess not. I don't mean nothing by it.
surprise|No shit? Drink's on me, then.
neutral|I don't like it, but orders are orders.
disgust|"Jean-Baptiste?" Sounds like someone got knocked out of the good book so hard his name broke.
neutral|The men looked at each other, looked at us, and asked me what we were going to do about it.
anger|Who the hell do you think you are? Looking to cash your chips to the sound of NCR bullets, eh? I can oblige.
anger|I shall honor your last words... and face you alone, as you request. No man will say I refused your challenge.
neutral|All right, let me do a quick test to make sure your body can handle another implant...
neutral|My men and I are leaving. You won't see us around here again.
anger|They're a bunch of evil savages if you ask me. We're out here trying to save these good people from being enslaved by those bastards.
neutral|Most of the limestone comes from Quarry Junction out west, but I hear some Deathclaws overran the quarry.
neutral|And since you're just about my favorite person in the world, each one is only going to cost you 100 caps. Interested?
joy|Papa may look like a big angry bear, but he's a softie at heart. Regis is cool - scary, but cool. The rest are all pretty groovy, even little Jerry.
joy|Guess sometimes you get the bull, other times you get the horns. Still, at least some lives got saved this day.
neutral|And there's a lot of them.
neutral|Lucky for you - probably - Elder McNamara wants to meet you. So follow me. Closely. Or you'll be killed.
fear|Boss, I'm having some... inadequacy issues here. Got a bigger gun I can borrow?
neutral|Dobson's my name. I'm an NCR Ranger, operating out of Camp McCarran north of here. Redding man by birth, though.
neutral|Sadly, they stopped working a few years back, so I sold them to a junk merchant who was passing through, otherwise I'd play some for you.
neutral|I'm sure someone's told you all this before. Several years back, we were running our chapter out the HELIOS One solar power station.
neutral|The Courier, cruel and merciless, had ensured that Mr. House would maintain complete control over New Vegas and everyone in it.
neutral|You take care of our problems here and I'll give you the information that you need.
neutral|I haven't left Jacobstown in years, but there was one woman in Novac... Gibson? I remember her living with a pack of hounds.
anger|We're fighting on their behalf, but Mr. House and the families are stringing us up, inch by inch.
neutral|That's not to say I don't believe you, just that maybe you got your facts mixed up a little. Let's head back to my camp and go over what you saw.
neutral|Indeed you did. And they seem to be in excellent condition.
neutral|The parts I understood? Didn't matter. Past all the garbage, all it amounted to was goodbye.
neutral|You've been one hell of a stroke of good luck, you know that? Those three scumbags probably killed twenty NCR troopers. And you bring them down alone.
neutral|If I or one of the others hears that you're topside, we might just come out and have a little chat.
neutral|Same old shit that's been going on for years. The NCR and Legion are still fighting over Hoover Dam for some reason.
neutral|Rangers get injured all the time. It's part of the job. But if you lose a few fingers, get a bad break, that's it. You step down.
neutral|If we can just find an instance where McNamara went around someone and gave orders to their subordinates, we'll have him.
neutral|Go up the path past the broken radio tower and go to the right... they're at the top of the trail.
neutral|Ah, it's nothing. You just looked like the health inspector who stopped through for the yearly inspection a couple weeks back.
joy|I need to take care of something, but I'll see you soon enough. Thanks for all of the help. It means a lot to me.
neutral|Out of respect for Hanlon's composure and worth as an adversary, Caesar had him beheaded.
neutral|I don't want to mention it out in plain sight like this. You never know who might be listening. Follow me.
neutral|When I quit the escort job, I had enough money to buy a pistol belt and some other gear.
surprise|Think twice before you decide to give the old chief a gut full of lead.
joy|Yes, I understand that he's decided to quit outright and not even ask for compensation. I'm a bit curious what exactly you said to him.
neutral|I've collected such musings in this report. Please take it to the Elder.
disgust|I shall carve your promises into your skin so that you might think on them - and let that be the lesson this day.
neutral|We enjoy our privileges because you take the greatest of risks and are prepared to make the most noble of sacrifices.
neutral|I can only spare a few more moments. What did you wish to speak about?
neutral|All right, then. We'll be on our way.
neutral|And they've been shooting them down like animals, haven't they?
neutral|I'm sure some don't, but the loyal ones do. And that's who we're aiming to help - the loyal ones.
anger|Because you're helping Caesar's Legion. They are bad. You are bad. I am going. Bye.
neutral|Hey, you're the one who helped us out with those NCR chumps. You really get around, don't you?
anger|What a piece of junk!
neutral|So just like that, we was all homeless. Went our separate ways, and that was all she wrote.
neutral|Old Victor woudn't be much use stuck inside just one Securitron! No, I can move from one to another with the snap of a finger!
disgust|Those are your final words? They are too weak to even wash the stain of your disgrace this day.
neutral|NCR? Here? Not for long.
joy|Felt good to put the old vaquero outfit on again. I feel a lot sharper with a pistol now. Still wouldn't put these old bones on the front lines.
joy|But the side effect of medical success is that more people live longer. Funny how that works.
neutral|Being a Knight would mean getting to see more of the world, fight the Brotherhood's enemies, and possibly someday become a Paladin like my mother.
neutral|We keep getting deliveries of ammunition for some reason. I don't mind target practice, but there isn't all that much to shoot at out here.
neutral|Still, there's someone who might - old Alice McLafferty, Crimson Caravan, might know something.
anger|Lost my caravan heading north, the driver burned to ash - and they didn't even take the cargo, they just burned that, too.
neutral|Goddammit. That's Violet, all right. You've made me one happy son of a bitch, you know that?
neutral|Why I remember one time when he... do you mind if we talk about something else?
neutral|Let's see... Physically, you're fine. Emotionally... well, I'm not the right kind of doctor for that.
neutral|"I can do better", he must have said to himself. And boy did he ever!
anger|The Legion is more than just Caesar! It's got the momentum of thousands of men behind it.
anger|Would serve these idiots right if me and my guys shot the place up after we got payback on Ringo.
neutral|Swooping in on a vertibird, guns blazing? Haven't done that in years, but all right, I'm in.
neutral|Take a look.
neutral|Though weakened, the Fiends attacked McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
neutral|Select Sunset Sarsaparilla bottles will have special caps with blue stars on them. These caps are known as Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars.
neutral|It really must be bad out there if he's sending you to us. Is the idea that we swoop in by vertibird, guns blazing?
anger|If you can't help me, who can?
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|Now don't go getting paranoid, pardner - that bullet to your brain-pan probably just bucked your Brahmin a little. We're all friends here.
disgust|The whole "slavery and cultural annihilation" stance he's adopted is bit repugnant to me.
neutral|Bring your robot to us, we'll see that whatever information it may have on it is used for the greater good.
neutral|There in the corral.
neutral|Chavez is the ringleader. Without him, his crew will fall apart, and I don't give a shit about those guys.
surprise|Yes. The Followers do not like Caesar or Caesar's Legion. You should also not like them. If you do, you like hurting people and that is bad. Goodbye.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|I'd take it straight to Mr. House if I were you! He'll think you're helping him out! Then when he's not looking - KER-POW!
neutral|Not the worst I ever been with, but more a pervert than most.
anger|That said, every once in a while I hear something so ignorant, I have to respond. This is one of those times.
sadness|It's nothing. Just tired, that's all.
neutral|So what we do is take away the whole reason why they'd want to come back! Smart, huh?
neutral|Any event, I prefer shooting if it comes down to an argument. Don't worry, I'll carry my weight if a disagreement arises.
neutral|...Really? Wow, it never occurred to me to actually give the money away. Do people really do things like that?
anger|Great Khans! Drive Caesar's dog out of our camp! If he's too slow to flee, kill him!
surprise|I was born in 2047, boss. If you do the math on that, I'm sure you'll get within a decade or so.
neutral|Bastard. You're just like everyone else around here.
neutral|He's content to have the agent spend his nights radioing troop positions back to our base camp. He knows I'm here, and he's left me to rot.
anger|No one likes a tease, baby.
anger|Sounds like they're already here. There's no way I'm letting them take me alive.
neutral|...as long as someone like the Courier was holding the cards.
neutral|It's obvious you know as little about medicine as I do. Spare me your excuses.
neutral|The time is fast approaching when my Legion will assault the great dam and invade the west.
neutral|Johnson and Moreno never got along, and I had my hands full keeping those two apart some days.
neutral|Nah, I'm gonna chill with my girl.
neutral|It is my pleasure to introduce to you. The President of the New California Republic, Aaron Kimball!
neutral|We aid some programs the Republic has sponsored involving sharecropper farms in the area, which seem to be coming along nicely.
neutral|Don't have all the ingredients you need - come back when you have 'em, and I'd be happy to get something cooking.
neutral|We don't have the forces or supplies necessary to chase them down. More's the pity.
anger|As was I... yet I was ordered to await you. Now that you are here, we may act.
neutral|Done.
neutral|If you say so, that's good enough for me!
neutral|This is useless.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Not many people in my company would have done what you did for me without some hesitation or asking me to cool down.
joy|I hear it's business as usual at the Gun Runners, as if nothing unusual happened. Excellent work.
neutral|That's all right. My friends got beat so bad they'll be recuperating for quite some time, so head over there when you can.
surprise|Lot of sites to this guy Golf all over the West.
neutral|This kiosk was specially constructed around me to deter theft and assault.
anger|I think you're cashed out enough that my chances are pretty good. And like I said, I'm not leaving the Dam now the Legion's been broken.
fear|It can't be! How the hell...
neutral|It didn't take long for him to repurpose their plasma technology for a government weapon contract.
neutral|See? Just because it doesn't shoot lasers doesn't mean it's not worth looking into. We could do amazing things with this data.
neutral|Fair enough. Since you seem to have pieced it together, I won't insult you by denying it any further.
sadness|Guess the miners got fucked.
joy|You understand, kids and all that. Everyone knows about each other in a Vault, there's no other way. I hope mol... I mean Mitch, is doing well!
anger|If I say the Brotherhood should be destroyed, it's necessary.
neutral|And for close-range suppression or crowd control, the Securitron is armed with a 9mm submachinegun.
neutral|I'm sure Henry has goals. He was just more concerned with the "how" than the "why" of things. Being in the Enclave didn't really mean much to him.
anger|The Brotherhood is all about keeping technology to themselves, and using what they find to protect themselves.
neutral|People would come from all around to learn how to sing, dance, dress, and even speak the way he did.
neutral|
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
anger|Yeah, I'm a merchant, just like I said.
neutral|Very funny, Veronica.
neutral|Great! When you find it, just turn it into Torres and I'll be in the clear.
neutral|Keith! In the name of the NCR, I'm placing you under arrest for illicit gambling and the sale of unlicensed chems.
joy|That's not to say Reyes is wrong for being concerned, but it's easy for the sand to get in your eyes out here.
neutral|Yes, they did. As will all the rest of you, in due time.
joy|<Laughs> All right, all right, you just hang on to the bar here... that's it.
neutral|Yeah, it does. There's not a chance you'll find me helping the NCR in any way. They've caused me too much grief.
neutral|Not much to tell, one of the worst posts in the NCR if you're looking to be anything more than a babysitter.
neutral|I hate to say it, but as long as the Alpha Male is still alive, that pack isn't going anywhere, even with the Deathclaw Mother out of the picture.
neutral|What'll fight on Blue?
joy|Yeah, I suppose he could still teach, take a less-active role in the world. That's not so bad.
anger|Well, this isn't doing much of anything.
neutral|Word of advice, though: if you ever catch up with him, watch out. The man's got cold eyes like a snake. Can't be trusted, I'd say.
anger|The worst impulses of mankind, concentrated in one insane, backward tribe.
joy|Kindly! The leaders of this fine community have accepted us among them. They give us food and protection from the outside.
neutral|Hope that helps. I owed you.
neutral|Brahmin barons only have one vote at the ballot box, but they have a lot of money to throw around.
neutral|My grandfather opened up this shop. Took over from him when the Fiends killed him.
surprise|Do? We don't, like, do anything. We make the magic happen.
neutral|Well, being a suave young guy, I chatted up the ladies from time to time, and one of the managers' girls started to take a liking to me.
joy|I'll be waiting, then. And training.
neutral|If somebody does something we don't like, we let them know about it. If they're strong enough not to care about us liking it, good for them.
neutral|I applaud your commitment to your own word, though it saddens me to hear of the fate of our comrades.
neutral|Super! Now when Mr. House is out of the way, we can use the Chip to install me at the Lucky 38.
anger|The garrison I established at Nelson has been wiped out.
neutral|I'm almost out of ideas, so you'd be more than welcome to.
neutral|Vegas always chewed men up... it's just a little more literal, nowadays.
neutral|Where did you get this?
surprise|You did? Where? Oh my God, I mean... I thought... I don't even know what I thought might have happened to him.
neutral|That's a great idea.
surprise|What, didn't see enough of the sites here the first time?
fear|Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
joy|I see you've met my star employee. A real performer, obviously - and a lot more reliable than the other candidate I considered for the position.
neutral|I messed up. Made a mistake. I thought I could help get us out of here, but... it didn't work out.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Done.
anger|Yeah, something's wrong, I can feel it.
neutral|Standard practice. Rangers operate on our own most of the time. And that's how we like it.
neutral|Well, happy trails, then!
neutral|Yeah, he did.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|You might have better luck with another member of the senior staff. Try talking to them about it.
neutral|Give it a whirl when you've got some time.  Now, was there anyone else you wanted to know about?
neutral|From what I hear, I'd want to eat at the Gourmand every night... if I were ambulatory.
neutral|It's your choice, but those rangers are only coming if we get our support.
neutral|All the outfits you see my guy wearing around were originally found in here, too. Along with more hair gel than you can shake a stick at.
neutral|I guess that'll do.
neutral|Not too long ago, they took Nelson and Searchlight.
neutral|It looks like you'll have to fight your way inside the Lucky 38 and take care of Mr. house with your own two hands! Or weapons held in them!
neutral|Behave yourself this time, Veronica.
neutral|I'm about five seconds away from telling my men to take them down, so speak fast.
neutral|Cowardly, though. They outnumbered us, yet not once did they try to resist.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Just as long as you keep making waves, that is. Be seeing you.
neutral|It is my belief that the creator sent you and Chris to expiate the sins of your kind against mine. You are redeemers both.
disgust|One's a ranger, one's an NCR trooper, supposed to represent unification of West and East... or some such shit.
joy|It won't exactly get better, but it'll get worse slower.
neutral|He probably said "lieutenant", Wayne.
neutral|Over time, as the Boomers found a need for gun powder, they developed a relationship with the Gun Runners, trading their surplus crops for munitions.
neutral|Not a whole lot to tell. There were only a few books left in here when we found it, and those were rotted away.
neutral|They go around in big suits of power armor, and they have lots of energy weapons! But there's a downside!
disgust|But the depths of your moral sickness, your dissolution? Nipton serves as the perfect object lesson.
neutral|There's not as many people playing at Gomorrah, so that means I've got better odds of winning big. I got this figured out.
neutral|That's no longer an option, on account of you having one of our passwords. Now if you'd stop stalling, I'd really like to know where you learned it.
neutral|An outsider! In the bunker!
neutral|Alright, whatcha got?
neutral|It's not perfect, but it's worth protecting, which is why we also have the largest military in existence.
surprise|Are you sure? I didn't even get to the ostensibly "good" part.
neutral|I overheard them saying that they are on their way to Novac. If you want to follow them I strongly suggest that you follow the road through Nipton.
neutral|Good, let's take a look... Hmmm, if I'm reading this right, it appears that the NCR's grip on this region is nowhere near as firm as I thought.
neutral|All right.
neutral|I don't think it's a waste of time. A handful of dead Powder Gangers ought to get the NCR to cough up some caps.
neutral|If you're more of a prude, the Followers run a mission out of the Old Mormon Fort up toward the north gate. Great place if you're hurt, I guess.
neutral|To call Lanius ferocious would be an understatement. In battle, he seizes the enemy in his jaws and will not let go.
neutral|Upon discovering the Kings' newfound relationship with the NCR, Legionaires flooded the streets of Freeside, and the Kings were quickly destroyed.
joy|But maybe you're just sightseeing. So, since the door's open and all, can I go now?
neutral|Don't take any chems here - hell knows what they're laced with.
joy|I don't think we've had the pleasure of meeting before. What can I do for you?
neutral|not only for his fellow Californians, but for California itself.
neutral|I can see your resolve, determined like the nature of a beast. So be it.
fear|Run! Beasts got free!
sadness|But I want to leave a legacy of greatness when I die. My tribe deserves better than this, cowering in a canyon and living on scraps.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Nothing. Want to head to the Wrangler later?
neutral|Hey, you're the one who's been going around helping people around here, right? The King says to keep up the good work, and said to give you this.
neutral|All.
neutral|But when we finally got up the gumption to go look outside all we found was our cattle. And I know what they sound like when they get upset.
neutral|First things first, though. You go settle things with Ringo and put a bullet between his eyes while I round up my crew and let them in on the plan.
neutral|See? I was right about you.
neutral|There are also several databanks with information on my research into Poseidon Energy and some projects they were working on in the Mojave area.
neutral|
neutral|Nice sign.
neutral|Here you go.
neutral|Tricked by the Courier and imprisoned by the Legion, Arcade remained Caesar's personal physician for several years.
neutral|So that means reduced tourism for up to five years! The equations are pretty complicated! Mr. House sure liked numbers!
disgust|That's NCR. Their compass is spinning, all the time.
neutral|They returned with tales of a city untouched by the warheads that had scorched the rest of the world - and a great wall spanning the Colorado River.
neutral|This is Powder Ganger territory - my territory. Most of the guys around here understand that. One, Chavez, doesn't.
neutral|Jacobstown prospered, becoming known as a fair - if somewhat intimidating - place for a trader to do business.
neutral|Once, he caught this private out of uniform and old Dornan went off on the most ear-blistering rant known to man. It was inspiring.
neutral|Once he finds out where an army's vulnerable, he'll go to it like a dog for the throat.
anger|Take your slander elsewhere.
neutral|So somebody's getting the word out.
anger|Of course. And I guard myself from such acts of cowardice and jealousy.
neutral|Most travelers heading south on in the I-15 just push on towards Primm unless they're in desperate need of supplies.
neutral|Dermot saves his money. Saint James spends his on Sweetie. A good customer, that one.
neutral|Hurry! We've got to get some before they notice us!
neutral|I'm getting... woozy.
neutral|
neutral|Caesar destroyed all evidence of their existence at Red Rock Canyon, and forbade mention of their name in any history.
neutral|When the tide of the battle turned for the worse, our Elder was nowhere to be found, and everything was chaos.
neutral|Sorry, sir. All that thinking has made my head hurt. I don't think I'll be doing any thinking for a long time.
neutral|The boss is waiting for ya.
joy|Really? The Tops, huh? Well, it's no Shark Club, but I hear security on the Strip is real tight. Even Mr. Bishop wouldn't hit a joint like that.
neutral|No. I got a funny feeling about you, and there's no way I'm trusting you to watch my back.
neutral|Jimmy's more of a "specialist." I only hear good things.
neutral|Do not hesitate, my friend. Learn from my mistake and go boldly, one way or the other.
neutral|That's a question I've been asked a lot lately, since it's something I have to decide for myself soon.
neutral|The override will enable to control the entire dam's power output.
neutral|Fighting as he wished he would've fought on the day of his wife's death, he brought down scores of Legionaries before being caught.
neutral|I knew someone named Clanden. Good fucking riddance.
anger|Caravan code of the wastes is you don't fuck with the one who brings you your mail, and you don't fuck with your supply line.
sadness|It seems presumptuous of me to think that I could join the fight, even if this is a cause worth fighting for.
neutral|Hmm?
anger|Mission accomplished, asshole. I never would've suspected a thing if you hadn't told me - but now I'll have to have you killed.
neutral|Oof.
neutral|Nothing, man.
neutral|The Nightkin have varying degrees of mental instability due their addiction to Stealth Boy use. I've been trying to come up with a cure.
neutral|There's a name I haven't heard in awhile. So, what's this reunion all about, then?
neutral|My point before? Is that you know the Mojave, and it's a hard place.
neutral|Such is the creator's will. Vision upon vision has shown me that, were Chris to accompany us, he would die in minutes.
neutral|This is a null line that no one will ever see.
neutral|What about it? Someone takes your stuff, you're free to take it back. If you can't, maybe you shouldn't have come to Freeside in the first place.
neutral|Although they performed admirably during NCR's defense of Hoover Dam, the rangers fell into decline soon after.
neutral|If that's true, that'd be the last of them...
neutral|Hey, what are you doing to my radio?
neutral|Hoover Dam, of course. A hydroelectric dam?
neutral|But they're not fooled 'cause he forgot to put the checkers on his face. I told him so and he seemed to take it to heart.
neutral|Sometimes I have to brew it myself if I'm too far from a bar. Not quality, but I'm for anything that takes the edge off the day.
neutral|When the land hunts you, when fighting for survival is the norm, your neighbors become either saviors, or enemies.
sadness|It has. It was a promising trade town - before the escape at the correctional facility. Lost a good bit of money at the Vikki and Vance.
neutral|What? You two on the outs? Ain't that a shame.
sadness|I miss those days sometimes. We all had a purpose, you know? I admit that some of the folks in charge were pretty ruthless.
surprise|They want to buy Cassidy Caravans? Don't they know it's burned to ash?
fear|Some folks think he's still alive, call him the Burned Man.
disgust|Guess NCR fucked this place, too.
surprise|What's changed since then?
neutral|That cowboy robot had us hire six couriers. Each was carrying something a little different. A pair of dice, a chess piece, that kind of stuff.
neutral|The facility was run by the NCR for a time, but the prisoners overcame their guards and used the prison as a base from which to conduct raids.
neutral|After their victory at Hoover Dam, Legion troops rolled through Freeside.
neutral|I wouldn't know anything about that, dear. You might ask Johnson.
neutral|Then I'd have to help you! I mean, it seems pretty obvious Benny wouldn't have wanted me to, but hey, not my fault I can't say no!
neutral|Well well, this is welcome news. Who is she?
anger|Enough.
anger|I know a bit about you, courier. Heard someone messed you up pretty bad over in Goodsprings. I heard a few other things too. Some good, but not all.
neutral|I'm not doing so well here.
anger|"New" California Republic - nothing new about it. Just a bunch of people with money and power pushing everyone else around.
neutral|Still going on about this, huh? Pretty sure I already said we want the NCR to back off and let us out.
neutral|With no other communities coming to its defense, Novac would eventually fall to the Legion's persistent attacks.
neutral|They were smarter, almost as smart as Nightkin, and were able to think and act for themselves.
neutral|The Courier, fair and even-handed in her dealings throughout the Wasteland, was honored by the NCR for her support of the military at Hoover Dam.
neutral|It's worth every cap, baby. I'll do things to you you didn't think was possible, and leave you feeling like everything's right in the world.
neutral|Come back in a few days, and I should be firmly installed as Elder.
neutral|Done.
anger|The Kings of Freeside are cooperating with the NCR now, which frees up soldiers to defend the dam.
joy|All right. Look at you, all fired up and ready to go. Wish the others around here had that kind of attitude.
anger|Maybe I should switch to a squirt gun.
joy|Anything to hold your attention, boss.
neutral|You must have something important in mind. I'm willing to go to this little reunion, but my work here isn't complete.
neutral|His latest campaign in the wilds of the Utah has concluded, and he is en route. When he arrives, your doom arrives with him.
neutral|Oh yeah, what would you have gotten?
anger|And you think they'll stop at that? How long before they attack the dam, or Vegas?
neutral|Yes? Did you reconsider?
joy|There's something I need to go do, but I'll catch up with you later. Thanks again for your help with the others. It means a lot to me.
neutral|Hardin will have my head if I don't find that weapon soon. I can't delay my report to him any longer.
neutral|<Sighs> For Pete's sake. Opening up. Welcome back, Veronica.
neutral|And here I thought us Great Khans were tough to kill. So, what happens now?
neutral|You've helped us plenty, so I'll tell you what. Just this once, name whatever you want, and if I can make it happen, it's done.
neutral|Once the way is clear, our feral brothers and sisters will accompany us on the Great Journey. If there are any left...
fear|We shouldn't be in here.
neutral|Coyotes? Yeah, they run folks onto the Strip, have some kind of connections over there. Everybody makes a living one way or another.
neutral|Westside is a part of New Vegas, just as much as it's a part of the Wasteland. In the end, stranger, we need them both to continue making our fate.
neutral|She was presented with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
neutral|I, Robert Edwin House, am deceased. Please approach a Securitron and take one of the printed obituaries.
sadness|Anyone who didn't get out was killed by the NCR. Even some of the ones who escaped were eventually hunted down by the Brotherhood of Steel.
neutral|Uh huh. Okay, second question - what was the original name of the NCR capital - Aradesh, Shady Sands, The Boneyard, or Vault 13?
neutral|I grew up in Vault 17. I never even saw the sun until I was 75 years old - that was when Super mutants raided the Vault and carried a lot of us off.
neutral|She has made her intentions plain. We will not risk any further damage.
neutral|As the Republic grew, so did its needs. Scouts spread east, seeking territory and wealth in the dry and merciless expanse of the Mojave desert.
neutral|Ouch, this one's got a bite, Simon! Call her off, or she'll get put down.
neutral|Lastly, if you're here about the health advisory that aired on channel 6 recently, say "Silly Ol' Advisory."
neutral|Name's Keith. You feeling lucky? I got games of chance, games of skill, games of you-name-it. Want to win a little cash?
neutral|Despite her departure from the group, the Brotherhood's peace treaty with NCR came as some relief to Veronica.
anger|The Legion? What about them?
joy|That's a good thing to see, huh boss?
anger|You know what? It's all yours, then. Fuck this shit! I'm done.
neutral|The Khans are just... they're a dirty people. They live in tents like animals! And they're very rude!
sadness|Yes, it just came in. Here's all of it.
surprise|I've woken up worse places. Not many, though.
neutral|Don't think everyone around here is going to tolerate your actions, outsider. A few of us have a mind to put you down like the animal you are.
neutral|It's irrelevant. In the short term, the Legion is still monster enough that defeating it will make me look powerful indeed.
neutral|I am ready to process our transaction.
neutral|Twelve years ago, they called out for help, and the republic heard them. Troopers and rangers, just like you, answered the clarion call.
neutral|Unless you can handle our supply shortages, the best we can do is scrape by in here in Freeside.
neutral|Just as a warning, my covert bandaging skills are a little rusty.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|The Legion is civilization reborn. Our culture is based on virtues such as martial excellence, loyalty, and justice.
neutral|Tell you what, come back later and you can take the test again, okay?
joy|The Mojave has a way of burning decent people up, but it sounds like you've done right by the NCR. It's appreciated. Now what can I do for you?
neutral|Recent engagements have taught us to fear their shock attacks, so it's a blessing that we seem to have superior firearms.
neutral|Be careful. You may want to talk to Lieutenant Hayes.
neutral|I'll grab my tools.
neutral|Pfff, that's old news. I had some fun with that girl that runs their operation, and then I got tired of her. So I moved on.
neutral|And all because of the Elder's explicit order that no one be allowed in or out. The only way things will change is if a new Elder is installed.
neutral|Caesar has put a lot of trust in you. Be worth it.
neutral|Mr. House continued to run New Vegas his way, a despotic vision of Pre-War glory. The streets were orderly, efficient, cold.
neutral|He caught me and made me tell on Mr. Anderson. I don't know what happened after that, but when I asked, Mr. Anderson said not to worry.
neutral|With its logs cleared and its systems upgraded ED-E is discovered by a traveling caravan, who take him on as a protector as they wander the wastes.
neutral|It was all Cooke's idea. He and his boys managed to swipe some dynamite and hide it away in their cells.
neutral|Look, no guarantee on the quality, only the results. And don't drink too much of this stuff or you might go blind.
disgust|If not, I'm sorry to inform you that you are, as the locals say, "nuttier than a Bighorner dropping."
disgust|The East was a hard-fought campaign. Even now, Caesar drew too much of the Legion's blood needed there for... this.
neutral|She wanted to sit in her room all day and make herself miserable. And she went out of her way to be rude.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|Sometimes we take those privileges for granted that our forebears fought so hard to achieve.
joy|Baby, that can go any direction you want. We can take Vegas together, or I can head for the nearest sunset. Your call.
neutral|Our instructions were pretty clear. Now you better get your ass out of here.
neutral|And at Owen's Lake, we made true on our promise, driving out the raider tribes to establish a lasting peace in the eastern Sierra Nevadas.
neutral|Had his nose stuck so high in the air, you couldn't see it above the clouds. City folk, they always think they deserve better than what they got.
neutral|I think you're right. We're getting desperate. Hardly enough people to sustain ourselves as a chapter. They'll see the light, sooner or later.
neutral|Well, there's Vault 21 and the NCR Embassy. Both places are located on the south side of the Strip.
neutral|Go to the leader of the Kings and tell him that I'll make sure Freeside gets more water, power, and food as long as the violence there stops.
neutral|Of course, after all you did for me, here are some chips for you. Play, have some fun.
neutral|Kimball won't be able to save him - he'll be too busy getting thrown out of office. But less than a 3% chance of suicide, mind you.
neutral|I know the Captain well. The destruction of the NCR monorail was his doing.
neutral|Jacobstown, constantly on guard for anti-mutant reprisals, never truly prospered.
neutral|None at all, Rhonda.
neutral|Yeesh, you're just all business, aren't you? Well, I like how I look, and that's what's important. Though it'd be nice if other people did too.
neutral|Well... Jackson in the Mojave Outpost could get it to folks in the West. I wouldn't trust anyone closer to the Colorado.
neutral|You got a bigger gun I can borrow?
neutral|She ended her days a wandering tinker.
neutral|I bet you would, but Pearl didn't give me permission to sell to outsiders.
anger|Great Khans! Drive Caesar's dog out of our camp! If he's too slow to flee, kill him!
neutral|That said, I'd like you to tell me why you're here.
neutral|Yes. The rockets will convey us to our promised land in the Far Beyond. Vision upon vision has confirmed it.
sadness|This was a long time ago. Before Caesar's Legion pacified Arizona and brought the raider tribes to heel.
neutral|Out to the Grand Canyon. He met a missionary from Utah, a man by the name of Joshua Graham. Graham helped translate for the Followers and the tribes.
neutral|Sorry friend, we really don't have a need for wasteland currency around here. We produce most of what we need.
neutral|Bzzzt... Law Enforcement Protocols reinstated, pardner. Initializing use of force authorization... authorization found. Yee-haw!
anger|Now, onto settle accounts with Gloria Van Graff. Putting her down would suit me just fine.
neutral|My deepest apologies for the slightest inconvenience. You have my assurance that everything will be returned upon your departure.
neutral|Once you get ahold of that Platinum Chip, I'll be able to help you in all sorts of ways.
neutral|We held out for a time, but we were grossly outnumbered, and they had more men than we had ammo. Eventually our positions collapsed.
neutral|<bark!>
neutral|We shut the quarry down while we waited for the NCR to get us some more blasting sticks, but now the Deathclaws have shown up.
surprise|That's not so bad. I should be able to treat you rather quickly.
neutral|Can't say as I have, but we usually keep to ourselves down here. You might have more luck up by the motel.
neutral|Even though she's a woman, she's killed every man who's faced her in the arena, even one of the elite Centurions. With her bare hands.
neutral|I'm glad they've watched out for me all these years. Maybe someday I can return the favor.
neutral|Done.
neutral|You want to know about anyone else?
neutral|My father had heart problems, and it ran down the family tree to me.
neutral|Say no more. I hope things work out for you.
sadness|I think she just wanted to remind herself that there are still nicer places in this world than Novac. Who could blame her for that?
neutral|The Followers of the Apocalypse used the information recovered from ED-E on Poseidon Energy, to develop new methods to harness the energy of the sun.
neutral|According to him, the NCR's decided enough's enough and's going to send in a mess of troops to take back the prison any day now.
joy|Hnh. Then when I return, man of the West... we shall see if your belief will withstand the blades of the Legion.
anger|Get to it, will you? You're wasting my time.
anger|They'll drain us dry while we fight and die over this dam. We offered them sanctuary in NCR territory before, but they won't listen.
neutral|I know the Captain well. If you wish to be of service, go talk to him.
neutral|That's not to say I don't get along with them. I just think they don't know what to do with me sometimes.
disgust|This is the NCR Embassy. Our little slice of heaven on the Strip.
neutral|We'd be the last to know.
neutral|We aid some programs the Republic has sponsored involving sharecropper farms in the area, but those haven't panned out too well from what I hear.
neutral|The bottom line for NCR is productivity and growth. Politicians back in Shady Sands are completely detached from the people actually living here.
neutral|Hanlon wisely stayed out of the spotlight, crediting General Oliver's leadership for NCR's success.
neutral|I bet you would, but Pearl didn't give me permission to sell to outsiders.
sadness|I was. I thought I'd accepted the fact that I could be the one ordering him to his death, but it's been more difficult than I thought.
joy|Anyway, they've got their good points and their bad, just like a lot of the old governments from before the War.
neutral|And that's another revealing look at mutantkind. Second generation Super Mutants. Big. Numerous. Dumb. More after this!
neutral|One, two, three... dammit, too many syllables!
joy|I can also do maintenance work on your stuff - I don't have the supplies for a real repair job, but I can keep your gear working longer.
neutral|Stay safe.
neutral|Or the Securitrons will kill all of them, too!
neutral|We decided to let him stay with us for a few days, over the course of which we learned that his technical skills far surpassed our own.
neutral|As I've said, your objective is to install an override module in the control room halfway across the dam. Are you ready perform this task?
neutral|They won, we didn't. It's as simple as that. The rest of us moved on while Moreno... didn't.
neutral|The location to the highway makes it a good spot to shake down any travelers passing through. That's why Eddie and the rest are still around.
neutral|He's here? Bless you, I thought he was a goner for sure.
neutral|Our Elder at the time, Elijah, was too concerned with getting HELIOS running and fending off the NCR, so he ordered us to leave them alone.
neutral|Then maybe you shouldn't pry into a lady's particulars, hmm?
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|As the inhabitants have now proven themselves hostile, no more respect will accorded them. Making their equipment fair game.
neutral|Oh, y-yeah. My s-stuttering was w-w-way worse before.
neutral|Little escapes the notice of Caesar's Legion. We know a great deal about the Vegas Strip, and the comings and goings of those who frequent it.
neutral|They stood and watched as their fellows were butchered, crucified, and burned, one by one.
neutral|She said what? Why didn't she just say so when I was there? Actually, come to think of it, I was pretty angry when I went down there.
neutral|Good. Your first challenge will be to reach their settlement without getting blown up. After that, should be easy.
neutral|<Coughing Fit>
surprise|I heard you try to convince Papa Khan not to join with Caesar's Legion. I'd like to talk to you about that for a moment.
neutral|Too dangerous. Gonna kill all yourselves if I let you touch it. Better to leave it buried - safer that way.
fear|I've run with some tough gangs, but I gotta admit they all got nothing on the Legion. I hear they stick you up on poles and it takes awhile to die.
neutral|Probably best that you just ignore it.
neutral|So you've said.
neutral|Oh my. I think I've been spotted...
neutral|Shouldn't be more than a few days work.
neutral|Sure. Here's what I've got.
neutral|As repayment for their NCR loyalty, Mr. House sends Securitrons to Primm to "protect" it and collect heavy taxes from its citizens.
neutral|All right, dear. If you're really sure.
neutral|Yes, that's what he wants us to believe. And when we turn our attention to other threats, he'll begin moving against us.
neutral|All right, all right! I believe you. Just don't say anything to my folks. You can tell the old hag I'm gone.
neutral|That's us. We got sent here to fix the rails and make some new ones, and for that we got to use dynamite.
neutral|It's just... such a shock to see Rhonda up and about again. I'm not sure what to do now.
neutral|Caesar honored her with a golden coin, minted in celebration of her contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
neutral|Very well.
neutral|I know the odds aren't good, but I've gotta try. I can't lose them.
neutral|Jacobstown withered away, its death going unnoticed by the rest of the Mojave.
neutral|No, don't believe I did, but you might ask around - the Novac folk usually see anyone traveling this way.
neutral|<bark!>
neutral|Who do you think you're talking to? Just because the King happens to like you, doesn't mean you can run your mouth any way you damn like.
surprise|You assassinate the head of the Chairmen in his own casino - and get away with it?
neutral|Then you're not going to shop here.
neutral|
neutral|Well, not as glamorous, I guess - roads back West were safer in most places. Most.
neutral|I keep hoping I'll come across some Old World designer gown when I'm scavenging, but it never happens. Maybe I should move back to California.
neutral|His body was heaped with those of many others in a nameless ravine on the Legion's long march home.
neutral|Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Keep talking like that and your ass is going to be in the gutter. 25%. Take it or leave it.
neutral|Unlike most of my brothers and sisters, Mama didn't get sick of my father and get rid of him. He died right before I was born.
neutral|Truly does the creator author a destiny for each and every one of us...
neutral|This old thing? Oh, I scavenged it off a wreck in Klamath. Leo showed me how to make it all ready for chopping, didn't you, Leo?
fear|That's not outside the border, they're moving in - and fast. Nipton wasn't the most friendly town, but...
neutral|We've tried to pass our philosophy on to the people of Freeside, but not everyone is ready to be a King.
neutral|The Burned Man was Caesar's advisor and general when the Legion was originally formed. The Burned Man led us to a disastrous defeat at the Dam.
sadness|...it doesn't matter. He died when we all retreated to Hidden Valley. I didn't expect to see him again, no one did.
sadness|That's the question I been asking myself.
neutral|Well then, hold onto your hat, because it's a doozy. Not many people have heard the true story behind Sunset Sarsaparilla. It's a right honor.
neutral|No rush! Take your time!
neutral|Wow, this is our first hot streak since we opened this place back up! Here's a little something, on the house.
neutral|My terms haven't changed. Janet is free to leave, but she forfeits the wages she's owed.
neutral|Well, when there's trouble regular NCR troops can't handle, they send in a Ranger. Problem solved.
joy|I'm here to dust off the cobwebs, make sure everything is working, that sort of thing.
anger|No, I came for a fight today, and if you're looking to make me budge, you better have a damn good left hook or I'm not going anywhere.
neutral|I want you to head up to the summit of Black Mountain and install this remote signal transmitter in one of their consoles.
neutral|You just gotta help her, man.
neutral|More importantly, this explains why my research into this group of Nightstalkers hasn't come up with a cure for the Nightkin.
neutral|If you need help from my team, just give the word. Driver Nephi's earned himself a few bullets in the gut.
neutral|I apologize for my rash action. I understand fighting and killing, not healing. I acted out of grief and loyalty.
neutral|The slaughter of the Van Graffs and the Crimson Caravan caused no end of trouble for NCR back West.
neutral|Stay safe.
anger|Not even slowing it down!
sadness|The Legion is the worst enemy we've ever faced, but we can't stop Caesar here, not without getting a lot of good people killed.
surprise|Did... did you say Poseidon Energy? I've been researching some Poseidon projects here.
neutral|Something tells me this isn't the first time you've done things that the NCR would find... objectionable.
neutral|Yes. But then I'd have to kill them.
neutral|Crap, you don't even want to live a few more days? Go. Get laid one more time or something - we're walking away. Three days.
neutral|You're probably right. This place has been going downhill for a long time. Maybe I could start over somewhere else.
neutral|Th-this again?
neutral|Nah, I'm gonna chill with my girl.
neutral|Where to begin? That you are weak, and we are strong? This much was known already.
anger|Jason is the prophet. The only reason you're up here is because he wants to talk to you.
neutral|What's more, there are two tribes of raiders causing trouble in this area as well. You'd be safer heading back up to Goodsprings.
neutral|Do I look destroyed, pardner? It's harder to put old Vic in Boot Hill than you might think!
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|I'll just wait here for Mistress Tabitha.
neutral|There's a job that needs doing here, and I'm assigning it to you.
neutral|Tell Garret I'd be happy to start at the Wrangler immediately. This should be a nice change of pace from retirement.
neutral|I'm glad I can count on you. Oh, and one other thing. The patrols each had a holotape detailing their missions that you can use to track them.
neutral|So sending anyone out reduces the Outpost's numbers and would be in direct violation of my orders from back West.
neutral|What did I tell you about breaking the rules? You're gonna learn the hard way, now.
anger|Yes it hurts, Leo, but the doctors can fix me right up!
neutral|Also, given a recent analysis of the sightings, we now estimate that Mr. House has at least four times as many securitrons as previously assumed.
neutral|You go other places, and there's always someone screaming at you to act a certain way, or to not do certain things.
neutral|Jackson might have something for you, if you haven't already spoken to that old buzzard.
neutral|Some of my team aren't without their share of scars, though, like Betsy and Sterling.
neutral|Under the Legion's banner, civilization - unforgiving as it was - finally came to the Mojave wasteland.
neutral|Then consider them ignored! If they end up firing their howitzers at us, we'll ignore that, too! Until it goes away!
neutral|Goodbye.
neutral|Yep, thanks for the help.
neutral|Hmph.
neutral|So you've said.
sadness|My mother and I left with some of the troopers from my father's old unit, the same people I've kept in contact with over the years.
disgust|Yeah, her name's... Ghost or something... fucking scary, ooooooh. Guess it's cause you'll never see her 'til your dead.
neutral|...only to be done in by a mail carrier with a grandiosity complex.
neutral|Wow! That is amazing! You are just - a hero! I am serious!
anger|They'll be of no use to the Legion, then.
neutral|Well, of course I am, silly! Mr. House is just the smartest, most wonderful man there ever was!
neutral|Also - I ran into this mark who was a little too tough for me. I mean, I could've taken him.
neutral|Not sure who's gonna take over with Eddie dead.
disgust|NCR officer, trooper, whatever - runs the place. He's over in the main building, the one without a bar.
neutral|Let me show you how it's done.
neutral|Why don't you go tell the Elder the good news. I'm sure it'll be a huge load off of his shoulders.
neutral|He's in a tent down the road. Just stay on the west side of the overpass if you don't want to get shot.
neutral|Crazy ass radio signals around here, couldn't make sense of them.
joy|In any case, Vegas might see a dip in revenue for a year or two, but eventually the tourists will come flooding back, and their money with them.
neutral|So NCR, tries to hold on to everything. They can't, because it's too big for them to get their arms around.
neutral|<bark! bark!>
surprise|And you got better.
neutral|You and me at Gomorrah, rolled up in those silk sheets. I got leave coming up in a bit, so let me know if you'll be around.
neutral|There are a number of people I'll need to talk to. The process won't be instantaneous, but with this evidence, my path is clear.
disgust|Fine. Come on, men, we're moving out.
fear|I hope we're not planning to cross the river.
neutral|Listen, you do what you gotta do to find him. I'd send my men with you but I'm worried they'd kill Ted if we got close.
neutral|Boone refused to take the Legion's victory lying down.
fear|Hold on a second. I need to talk to you about something else.
neutral|Uh... okay, look... first, I didn't have anything to do with that trooper. That was all Anderson.
joy|That's sweet of you to say, even if it isn't true.
neutral|It's complicated. Goes way back. I told President Kimball that we need more rangers here.
anger|Could use sheet metal, not a sheet.
neutral|Now you're talking. Here's how it works, I'll keep nearby for the duration of your stay here, and no one messes with you.
neutral|If you've seen half the things I've seen out in the Wasteland, I can't say I blame you. I might be able to help with that.
neutral|<bark!>
neutral|But once Caesar broke him, he was born again. He'll go anywhere and do anything to win. Legion says he can smell weakness.
neutral|He told me he'd take action right away, and sent out several patrols to search for parts.
neutral|Still, there's someone who might - old Alice McLafferty, Crimson Caravan, might know something.
neutral|it is my honor to present you with the Star of Sierra Madre.
neutral|I bet I'm going to like it in that mainframe!
neutral|Had a look on her face like she'd smelled something sour. But far as I can remember, the gift shop smelled fine. Well... fine as it always does.
neutral|An ultimatum? Do you even know who you're talking to? We're the Kings, and no King will ever accept an ultimatum.
neutral|An army like that should be enough to defend Vegas from - I'm gonna say anybody!
neutral|Good. I'll make it worth your while. And one more thing. We shouldn't speak again. Not until it's over.
anger|Better than a long hot soak in an oatmeal bath!
neutral|<Sighs> Figures.
neutral|That's better. Maybe I should've been a surgeon.
neutral|Got a funny name. Call themselves Caesar's Legion. Never seen 'em in these parts, so I couldn't tell you much.
neutral|If they've got the parts, bring them on back. We need to get the array back up and charging.
joy|I'm glad to see you've given it some thought. Are you willing to go talk to them?
neutral|Right, who wants a vast army of mechanical servants to savage your enemy? Why make it easy?
neutral|You... blew it up? It's just funny, because that... army... seems like the secret weapon that was the whole point of... you know?
neutral|Meat and hide, mostly. Can't put a pack on 'em - they just lay down until you take it off.
neutral|But... Mr. Anderson had this look on his face. It's the look grownups get when they've done something bad.
neutral|Thank you. I change names and jobs every decade or so, just to keep things interesting. I picked "Calamity" this time because it sounded nice.
neutral|You killed another one? Let me have a look at the head...
disgust|Yeah, okay, boss. Take your time. Not like I'm a decrepit old man who might keel over dead any minute.
neutral|What? N-No, I knew you were just kidding. Ha ha. You're a funny one, all right.
neutral|I've also left some bomb ingredients in with the explosives. You are to take those to the footlocker of a Private Crenshaw.
neutral|I never finished my training - the Legion saw to that when they overran my town.
neutral|Just give me a sign when you're about to pull out the dagger so I know when to make a run for the cliffs.
neutral|Now, how about spending some of those caps in the saloon?
anger|They sure don't, but I hope you get everything that's coming to you.
neutral|Yes, I've always known they were. Luckily, they don't know exactly where we are. And even if they did, our position here is fortified.
neutral|Or if a tribe is nasty, or going to be a problem - go ahead and exterminate it! It's whatever you want to do!
neutral|I keep at it, eventually I'll make it to Ace. Think I'll skip Queen, though.
fear|Okay. Don't have to make a decision now. Just... sleep on it or something.
neutral|Fuck, I was getting tired of this place anyways. I can find girls to play with somewhere else.
neutral|Caesar, unimpressed with their performance and their dependence on chems, had them exterminated.
neutral|digital numbness,
anger|Oh, I'm sure. Killing never felt so good, could almost hear the dead behind me guiding my hand.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Fine, just leave me to my misery then.
neutral|But I had a good feeling about you. You look like you been through a lot.
neutral|The fine proprietors of Mick & Ralph's appreciate that kind of attitude, and would like to offer you a discount on their fine wares.
neutral|Yet deep down, she understood that it meant their end would surely be soon to follow.
neutral|Doggies!
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|With a little instruction, using it becomes as natural as simple movement, but to the ignorant, it's just so much heavy junk.
neutral|One of the "mitigating contingencies" he planned was to enlist the Followers to  provide increased medical aid throughout the region.
neutral|Doc's inside the Lodge.
neutral|Anything else I can help with?
neutral|I told them that when Legionaries are disloyal, some are punished, the others made to watch. And I announced the lottery.
neutral|Well, now, there's an interesting idea - do a bit of good before we're all dead and forgotten. You can count me in.
neutral|Although they performed admirably during NCR's defense of Hoover Dam, the rangers fell into decline soon after.
neutral|You do?
neutral|Hmm? Oh, it's you, Veronica.
neutral|No... No, I'd agree with that. And Alice and Gloria are two crows that'd keep something like that in their nest.
neutral|Good. Stick to the rules.
neutral|NCR repulsed the attack with minimal losses and, in the following days, destroyed the remaining Fiend leaders, breaking their power forever.
neutral|Some of these weapons look like they came from Hawthorne Army Depot, place has a lot of history.
neutral|Please, don't let me stop you. I know what it's like to have a lot on your mind.
neutral|Convinced that his time as a gunslinger was past, Raul made peace with the idea of growing old.
neutral|For about ten years now. Toughest training I've ever done, and was the proudest day of my life when I got my Ranger badge.
neutral|Even if we wanted to, we don't have the resources to handle such a monumental task right now.
neutral|Sitting tight. And pretty.
neutral|This again? Like I said, I'm against taking on the Powder Gangers. My supplies aren't cheap, you know.
neutral|Just seems like it might help keep things stable when we go independent. Not that I know what I'm talking about!
neutral|Hi, sorry to break in, he sounded truly riveting. I don't want to keep you much longer, but I'd like to make a counter suggestion.
neutral|I recommend following the Securitron's instructions. Its programming is... strict, and I don't have time to change it.
neutral|My purpose here is none of your concern. Now leave me be or I'll be forced to defend myself.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|Yeah, get out of here.
anger|Looking for target practice, you keep talking.
disgust|Now, onto settle accounts with Alice McLafferty. Putting her down - that would suit me just fine.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Some of the things we did were questionable, I know. That's just how it was back then. Figure I've done enough good to make up for any sins, anyhow.
neutral|The NCR is huge, now. We're talking on a scale that's difficult to imagine. Time was, we could fight them and hold our own. Not so anymore.
neutral|Hey, you try getting a date wearing Scribe robes. Might as well be wearing sweatpants.
neutral|Instead, the two sides maintained a long stalemate, and only after an extended duration did the NCR finally destroy its opponent.
surprise|You're not kidding. You're in bad shape, friend. I'd be happy to fix you up... for a reasonable fee.
disgust|You are definitely barking up the wrong bar stool. Whatever you're suggesting, not interested.
sadness|While that is disheartening news, there remains hope that the other two patrols may still be found alive.
neutral|Did you want something else?
neutral|Done.
neutral|As for your request, it's, uh, a bit ghoulish if you ask me, but Rey is pretty old and I'll probably have to put him down soon enough.
neutral|Not much reason to ship water here, but liquor... hard to meet demand.
neutral|Don't tell her I said that, though. Might take a bullet some night when I'm going to the latrine.
neutral|Very little, same as everyone else. We attempted to deal with him when we first moved into the area, but had no luck.
neutral|Tabitha, enraged by Raul's escape, took the remaining Nightkin of Black Mountain with her and vanished without a trace.
neutral|It'll be my good deed for the day. Take care now.
neutral|Suits me. What did you have in mind?
neutral|You know - shape the future of Vegas! Choose your neighbors! If you like a tribe, leave it alone!
sadness|I'm afraid you can't handle any more implants right now. Your body isn't durable enough to take it. Sorry.

neutral|You may remember how the bunker at the Fort was rather dimly lit? Well, just like the Lucky 38, it needs a big jolt of electricity to power up.
neutral|Good. Chavez and his boys were last seen south of here. If you're lucky and he's careless, he might still be there.
neutral|\|Annihilation\| Guess someone had to put them down.
anger|Yeah, well, you aren't me, so good-for-fucking-you.
neutral|For better or worse, I am not my father. I never had a life with the Enclave, and it would be silly for me to try to start one now.
disgust|You think so, boss? Because I remember a time when a lot of people stuck to their duty no matter what.
neutral|Oooh, sounds dramatic! I like it! Wind them up and let them go!
neutral|You can tell the Lieutenant that I finally caved. I'll... get help. There's a Doctor Usanagi who's supposed to be good at this sort of thing.
neutral|Okay, but this is the last story I can tell without a bigger risk to my rep.
joy|If the West is one day filled with ones such as you, perhaps it shall be a worthy fight, indeed.
neutral|With no work to be had, all the workers around here have wandered off. I'm the only one left in town.
surprise|Hell, it's all dangerous. Know why? Because you can't trust anything that stands on two legs.
neutral|During the NCR's retreat, the Fiends overwhelmed many of the troopers before Mr. House's Securitrons could deal with them.
disgust|Not interested in any weapon that shoots blanks.
neutral|Heads up. Looks like we've got another customer.
neutral|I'll take a look, but you better have a good reason for asking me to violate his privacy.
neutral|So she laughed, said fuck it all, and raised a bottle to the Dam and the ones who had fought for it.
neutral|Great! So I've been looking over Mr. House's force projections and running some calculations...
neutral|Since they came to town he was keeping a good bit of notes on them, and he was slinking around Bison Steve when your pretty-boy friend came through.
neutral|<whimper>
neutral|Aside from her, I know that the Fiends and Caesar's Legion fight alongside dogs. There could be viable specimens among them, if you can get to them.
neutral|That is sad news, indeed, and I thank you for making your way here to convey it to us, but now the issue remains that an outsider knows our location.
neutral|Joshua Graham, Caesar's old legate, he's wasn't so flexible.
neutral|No offense, pardner, but I'd rather not have you rooting around in there. It's technical-like.
neutral|Finally, while you are now a member of the Brotherhood, I cannot ask any more of you. I'm sure you have goals of your own outside these walls.
anger|So we could act like the last two thousand years didn't happen? Play dress up so we can fight ancient wars all over again?
neutral|The usual. Troopers getting drunk and causing problems. Like that's a surprise to anyone.
neutral|Legends of their power spread throughout the southwest, a reminder of why people once feared the sight of vertibirds in the sky.
neutral|Eventually she would take to the road, less in hopes of finding a new home than of leaving memories of the old one behind her.
neutral|Those who did were almost always tourists, come to visit the graveyard where the Courier "rose from the dead."
neutral|Vale.
neutral|She's a good earner. Of course, she don't care who she sleeps with or what they do to her.
neutral|Let me have a word with a few other folks and I'll see if I can't round up some more members for this militia you're creating.
neutral|The dangerous ones are roamers, though there's another group that mostly stays put, over at the prison southwest of here.
neutral|Eventually the Boomers began wandering out into the wasteland, while still preventing outsiders from entering Nellis.
neutral|I wish I could, but I'm neuro-computationally incapable of making decisions like this one! It's up to you!
neutral|That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
neutral|You take care now.
anger|Could I trouble you for some bullets, boss?
neutral|If this plan will bring us one step closer to revitalizing the region, you can count on our support.
neutral|It is, Mistress Tabitha. How I've missed you so. This stranger here fixed me up right as rain. Is he a friend of yours?
neutral|
neutral|I'm not standing here because I'm overburdened with emotion. Take some of this stuff off of me so I can move a little more easily.
neutral|I could probably put together a debate curriculum and pull out some of those old philosophy books.
joy|I thought I was done forever... but after traveling with you, I realize that was the wrong decision. So thanks for that, boss.
anger|Okay, okay, you don't have to agree with me that much.
neutral|Of course.
neutral|Thanks a bunch.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
anger|Me, that's who. I'm not going to let it go just yet. There... there might be some survivors... or...
neutral|In order to maintain the peace, and adhere to the strictures of the lockdown, I need to send someone else to discover what happened to them.
neutral|If you can't bring her here, then make sure she never leaves the Outpost, and that's fine with me.
neutral|
sadness|Not really, boss, no.
neutral|I guess we can send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope. They need all the help they can get there.
neutral|That's when we ordered the rangers and 1st recon sharpshooters to start picking off veteran legion officers from a high ridge west of the dam.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
fear|I remember there were some weird stories about him, especially near the end.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|Unfortunately, when word spread that Arcade was once a member of the Enclave, he was forced out of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
neutral|Yeah, sounds cool.
neutral|He was presented with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the republic.
neutral|Especially with Cachino gone, we could use another pair of competent hands, and I think you can provide that.
neutral|Oh, sorry. I thought everybody knew already. I'm a trader with the Crimson Caravan Company.
neutral|However, as the project was canceled and all Duraframe assets are being diverted to Hellfire Armor, I am sending this model to the Navarro outpost.
disgust|They're just people who were trying to get to the only well in fifty miles. I didn't have to talk to the men to see that they did not care one bit.
neutral|So what type of mutant did you want to talk about this time, Best Friend Tabitha?
neutral|Oh yeah, I heard some new things that you might find interesting. I'm going to have to start charging 100 caps per tip, though.
neutral|I don't have time to think about silly things like politics right now. My main concern right now is getting this blasted datastore up and running.
neutral|Oh shit! They saw us. Get out of here, quick!
neutral|I'll be right here if you change your mind, honey. Just let me know.
neutral|I know some things are hard to let go, but you and Miss Cassidy need to understand that, hear me?
neutral|I don't appreciate how much harder I have to work to cover for his tendency to focus on his personal projects.
neutral|But enough reminiscing. Did you have other questions?
neutral|Thanks to you, Primm's on the way back up. With folks watching over us, I think the raiders will keep their distance.
anger|Sorry, but there's no glory in helping out the NCR.
neutral|That was a failure of strategy, not philosophy. If Father El- the Elder in charge were a Paladin and not a Scribe-
surprise|You must be mistaken - I haven't filed any report like that. Trained deathclaws? I would have remembered that.
surprise|No shit. There it is, the blood, the motive, as clear as day. They must have penned these with snake venom.
neutral|Caesar honored him with a golden coin, minted in celebration of his contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
neutral|Yep. He sure did. Wanted himself a hotel, and to make sure once he made the change there'd never be any going back.
anger|I get it. We share a common enemy. And now you come before the mighty Caesar to what - offer your services?
neutral|Well, we finally got around to cataloging the damn thing and got shut out of our own datastore the second it loaded. Turns out it had a virus on it.
anger|What, again? Didn't I just change those damn things? All right, fine - show me the new codes.
neutral|Maybe an antique horoscope. Or an antique sandwich.
disgust|I don't see anything wrong with you.
neutral|So, looks like we have us a thief. All right, guess I'm talking to you instead of the girl.
neutral|The East will hold. Once across the Colorado, nothing to rival Hoover Dam remains.
anger|Here's my proposition. If you want to work together to help the people around here, I'll lend a hand. If you start acting like a crazy waster...
anger|That'd take years... and with the war with the Legion, no way they're going to waste time running up the Crimson Caravan or the Van Graffs!
neutral|Ooooh, you must know a lot about the nightkin, Best Friend Tabitha, seeing as how you are one!
neutral|Nelson might not be the most strategically important place, but taking Dead Sea out means a lot to them.
joy|If you ever have any gear you need fixed, don't hesitate to ask.
neutral|That's not really necessary, is it? I already told you I got this here revolver, right?
neutral|The shielding of the bunker prevents us from actively tracking them, but their positions should show up on your map once you get to the surface.
neutral|Looks like this place go mined - in the wrong ways.
neutral|Yeah, I bet you have. Not important enough for you to remember, huh?
neutral|Then again, I wouldn't be surprised if our chef used it here and there as a secret ingredient to make his dishes really come alive.
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|Due to their temporary truce, the Brotherhood allowed the NCR to retreat from the Mojave Wasteland without incident.
neutral|I'm happy you cleaned that up for me, but we've got another situation to worry about. There's a merchant hanging around near the prison.
sadness|Yeah, if you couldn't tell, I'm not from around here and I'm not NCR. I run a caravan... or did.
anger|I'd have to be convinced that present benefits outweighed future costs.
neutral|Let's roll out, then.
anger|If you set aside his leadership capabilities, extensive knowledge, and ruthless cunning, he's just another jerk who steps on people to get his way.
joy|Silus, the Centurion who let himself get captured, died at McCarran before he could reveal sensitive information.
fear|I don't know a thing about no missing refugees from that Aerotech camp. Go cry to somebody else.
neutral|Wish I had a few grunts as good as you. Damn good working with you.
neutral|See now, thing is, I fancy myself a bit of a tracker. And I don't see much in the way of tracks 'round here.
neutral|I think that robot who pulled you out of the dirt belongs to Mr. House. If Mr. House is looking after you, that's gotta be a good thing, right?
neutral|See you.
neutral|Uh-huh.
neutral|Roger, I'll radio them over now.
neutral|I'd appreciate it. As her CO, I could order her to get help, but I'd have her agree with the idea.
surprise|Tell you what, I'll at least think about it for a while. Ask me about it again another time.
neutral|You may have questionable methods, outsider, but some of us realize you get the job done.
neutral|Uh huh. Okay, second question - what was the original name of the NCR capital - Aradesh, Shady Sands, The Boneyard, or Vault 13?
joy|Let's just say it's truly a sight to behold.
neutral|Got a few strange looks at first, but those stopped when I got top marks across the board during training, and became an officer at seventeen.
anger|Sounds like a stupid policy to me.
neutral|Done.
neutral|I'll answer if I can.
surprise|Your weakness? You seek to thwart me by claiming the Legion is too strong for you?
neutral|I'll be. Let me take a look at that.
neutral|
neutral|I'm sure you have your reasons, but we are much too busy to waste our time on those selfish bastards.
neutral|With Cooke dead, the Powder Gangers at Vault 19 fell apart.
neutral|I don't know. Last time anyone saw him was in the battle at HELIOS One. I wasn't there.
anger|What am I gonna say? "No thanks?"
anger|A doctor's bag and some whiskey, if you don't mind.
neutral|
disgust|I see. Was it ill fortune, or is Caesar's faith in you misplaced? Either way - it's done.
anger|Well, there's what we're supposed to be doing and what we're actually doing.
anger|And don't try looking for me - it was a mistake to show up in the Mojave in the first place, and I'm not about to repeat that mistake twice.
neutral|If you must.
joy|...Relax. I'm fucking with you.
neutral|Thing is, I really just wanted an excuse to drink - should last me for a while.
neutral|You show great promise. I look forward to the time when I can call you "My Hunter," but that time has not yet arrived.
neutral|After the Legion's victory, the new Caesar learned the Followers had "defamed" the original Caesar's noble origins.
sadness|I know I'm just along for the ride, but it's made me think about the past, how I might be able to help out.
neutral|This weapon's done.
neutral|Indeed you will. Just bear in mind that's not the reason you're there.
neutral|You will? Thank you for helping me. Please hurry.
neutral|I can't help it! There's a little bit of me in every Securitron out on the Strip, so if this instance gets destroyed, I just download to a new one.
anger|Of all the goddamn luck...
neutral|That Saint James is all over Sweetie every time he rustles up the caps to afford her. She says he's peculiar but who isn't?
neutral|I am Cursor Lucullus, and my orders are to escort you to the Legion's camp at Fortification Hill. Are you ready to go?
neutral|So most of the time we're just taking care of logistics and coordinating with other checkpoints over the radio.
anger|The ones who came after us, I killed. The rest, I left be. I had to take care of Rafaela, not throw my life away on revenge.
neutral|You are free to leave.
neutral|Despite their vigilance against potential attacks by the Legion, the citizens of Novac were no match for the Courier.
sadness|What the Followers always do. Whatever we can.
neutral|When they did, it appeared they did so with the help of fresh reinforcements. I do not believe they could have managed the feat without them.
neutral|Okay, say no more.
anger|That was lower than low.
neutral|Plus, having a new gun suddenly show up would immediately point to you, being the only outsider around here and all.
neutral|He was cute, though, so after having her way with him, she got the hell out, leaving an empty whiskey bottle as a note.
neutral|No, I don't wear it on- Enough.
disgust|Better than nothing. But close to it.
neutral|I might be going scum-hunting later. You game?
neutral|Well, like just about everyone else here, I grew up in the Brotherhood. My father was a Scribe and my mother a Paladin.
neutral|
neutral|Their leader seems different, though. The few times I've dealt with him I've been impressed despite myself.
neutral|Though he found that independence for New Vegas was not all he hoped it would be, Arcade did his best to help the locals govern themselves.
neutral|I'm not sure what's going on at Lucky 38. That place is weird. Nobody ever goes in. Nobody ever comes out.
neutral|That's where Mr. House and his Securitrons are set up, but no one's been in there as long as people can remember.
sadness|I'm old and I'm starting to feel it. It's not pleasant, especially when you know your mind's slipping away.
neutral|Goodbye.
neutral|
neutral|Can I make it up?
neutral|Well, some of Mr. House's projections predict a "moderate probability of civil instability subsequent to the NCR being driven from the Vegas region."
disgust|Ain't been on the strip long, have you, pal? Name's Swank. This is my joint.
neutral|'Course, seems a lot less remote since you showed up. Plus I haven't been able to get my radio working, and a safehouse's no good without one.
neutral|Can find a bunch of wild ones high up in the hills, but gotta be careful around 'em. They can put up a decent fight if cornered.
neutral|With Hanlon's plot against the occupation exposed and Oliver denounced for losing Hoover Dam, many rangers were greeted coldly on their return home.
neutral|It has come to my attention that some of you dumb-dumbs took me a little too seriously in the past when I warned you about the battle cattle.
anger|Caesar can cite Cato to suit his purpose. Many people have spoken Latin. Some of them were quite pleasant.
neutral|I can't believe he's kept something like this to himself! We should have every able-bodied person in the chapter working on this.
disgust|I don't see anything wrong with you.
neutral|
anger|To name a few things off the top of my head - expand his borders, get the NCR and Legion to wipe each other out, and seize Hoover Dam.
neutral|Glory? Glory's fucking crazy.
neutral|You may have questionable methods, outsider, but some of us realize you get the job done.
anger|Grandma needs her medicine!
neutral|Violet's got dogs. Lots of dogs. While they're ripping you to shreds up close, she'll be putting rounds through you with her rifle.
anger|Fucking monument.
neutral|Did you get the number of that Brahmin that trampled you? Sheesh! If you want me to stitch you back together, it'll be 100 caps.
neutral|Why the need for a bunch of old warhorses like us?
neutral|the men and women who fulfilled the promise we made to the Desert Rangers.
neutral|Just keep an eye out for them while you travel. I've found cards in old boxes or forgotten on shelves. Can find some for sale, too.
sadness|It was. I started to build up a legend. Sometimes it headed off trouble, but most of the time it just started more.
neutral|They do what they can to keep things safe in the region, but if you ask me, they're trying to do too much. They're spread too thin.
neutral|Saint James has problems, that's for sure. Never wants me to say a thing, or for me to move around, either.
joy|Since you're here, I can offer you some medical supplies. I can't give you everything I have but I can give you a few things.
neutral|We've got more than a few people in here who are going a little stir crazy.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Won't be a problem. We have plenty of spice traders working with us back home, and we could get meat from local Brahmin ranchers.
neutral|
neutral|The Boss is pretty clear on this. I can't let you in unless you're by your lonesome.
neutral|Done.
neutral|I know there's something worth saving in there. But we're in decline. Our membership is... decimated. There's got to be something we can do.
neutral|Oh, and you'll need my part of the pass phrase to get into the bunker - "Navarro."
neutral|We were getting a little worried. Where's your partner? No, on second thought, don't tell me.
neutral|I don't know why his friend Dermot chose to stay here - he's never been with me or nobody else. But Saint James likes having me close at hand.
neutral|I told you, I ain't ever doing that again - ever. It was like being a slave all over again.
neutral|What the-? Don't touch me. I could get a better massage from a baby.
surprise|I'm surprised to hear you say that. I thought you had a problem with people who hold on to the past.
neutral|Hsu sent you? This was my mission!
neutral|An auspicious name, don't you think? It was mine before I became as I am now. Before the Great War, even.
neutral|Time for medicine!
neutral|Now watch this - I'm downloading the Mark II OS to all the Securitrons on the network. Makes quite a difference!
anger|You don't have to see the man to see the effect he has.
neutral|During the Battle of Hoover Dam, the Great Khans quickly evacuated Red Rock Canyon and headed north and east into the plains of Wyoming.
neutral|The Kings tried to fight back, but most were killed, and the rest fled into the wasteland.
neutral|It looks like that last bit you brought me was enough to fill the quota.
neutral|I'm trying to get some reinforcements here, maybe some guns with some firepower, but... shit... things are just going slow.
neutral|Losing the dam was the worst defeat the Legion ever suffered. Graham had been with Caesar since the beginning, but he had to set an example.
neutral|I wonder if he would. It's pointless, I know, but sometimes I wonder what he wanted me to be.
neutral|
neutral|It went on for hours, and did not always make sense. But that was the first day only. Since then, silence.
neutral|I wish I could say I was surprised. But that is what we've come to expect from your kind.
neutral|Go to him, and you will understand.
neutral|He won't turn on us, but he's a good shot and I'd hate to do this without him.
anger|Before that happens, I want Mr. House erased from the picture. Not just the man you killed, but what he left behind. His legacy.
neutral|You're starting to get quite the reputation around here, aren't you? Don't get me wrong, I'm not passing judgement or anything.
neutral|You should speak to him if you get the chance - he's always saying how badly understaffed they are.
neutral|It's a protective measure that was enacted after our defeat at HELIOS. The NCR was hot on our heels, and we wouldn't have survived another encounter.
neutral|Install the override module on the terminal in the power control room! I'll disable the generator failsafes, and you can do the rest.
neutral|Arcade was tending to the locals of Freeside when he learned that Caesar's Legion had been defeated and NCR was being pushed out of New Vegas.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|That's sweet of you, dearie. I'll try to be better about controlling myself if I see you try to sneak away.
neutral|Somethin' like that, yeah. There were some working tapes here when we first got here, so we know what he sounded like.
joy|By the time they recover and try to strike back, I'll be invading them.
neutral|We'll leave a few of them in that footlocker in the corner every so often. The Paladins scoff at using recycled ammo, so no one should mind.
neutral|Ah, now you've got me all nostalgic-like. Maybe I'd be better off trying to find a way to make this place better than giving up and leaving.
neutral|I'm afraid I don't know much myself. Mr. House has got his own casino, the Lucky 38, but nobody goes in or out except his robots.
neutral|Look... and what I'm about to say, I don't mean as any offense to you, I know where your sympathies lie.
neutral|They're our chief competitors in this region, and many others. That makes them our enemies.
neutral|Well, all right, then, dearie. I suppose I'll have my holotapes to remind me of Becky and Jimmy....
neutral|They're organized, I'll give them that. The few times I've encountered them firsthand, I've been impressed with their discipline.
joy|Dig it, baby, he beat feet to his suite. You scare the big boss man or something?
neutral|Indeed I do good sir, and I would be thrilled to share that information with you as soon as I am released from captivity.
neutral|But we must turn our minds to other matters. When I sent out those patrols, I also sent three Knights out on scouting missions.
neutral|We never did find out exactly what he was talking about. When the perimeter was finally overrun, the Elder had simply vanished.
neutral|You, over there! Go back where you came from, thieves! Don't try our patience!
neutral|Neat. Let me know what you find out!
neutral|10 of Spades always had plenty to say, before he got himself killed. Me, I'm just here to do my job.
neutral|Sometimes it's hard to remember them, so I take that old tape out from time to time and listen.
neutral|Though Arcade was proud to have been one of the defenders who turned back the Legion at Hoover Dam, he was crushed by Mr. House's ascent to power.
neutral|The artillery weapon needs the firing mechanism replaced. Any help you can offer would be appreciated.
joy|You're preaching to the choir here, boss. Once a man's prime is behind him, he should let it go.
sadness|But I can't bring myself to hate them the way Papa does. Things would damn sure be better for us if they were in charge than Caesar.
neutral|Word of advice - behave. Between the NCR military police and Mr. House's robots, you don't want to be causing trouble on the Strip.
neutral|As are all crimes. If you feel strongly about it, attack us, and soon you won't feel a thing.
joy|Good. "In hoc signo taurus vinces."
neutral|But the answer would never come, and the dangers of the world that had left the Brotherhood of Steel behind would eventually claim her life.
neutral|You're starting to get quite the reputation around here, aren't you? Don't get me wrong, I'm not passing judgement or anything.
neutral|All right then, let's move out.
neutral|What?! No! I mean, I haven't seen her around for a while, but I thought she was just busy working.
neutral|Mom died waiting for him, and she had me to raise. She was sick but she held off dying until I was old enough to be getting into trouble with boys.
anger|Well. This isn't good. Think I've been poisoned, boss.
neutral|Now-now, it ain't my fault that Dorothy and the Tin Man happened to be on the same yellow-striped road, is it?
neutral|Ooh, I'm sorry. It looks like you've got some of your facts mixed up. I'm afraid I can't help you.
anger|If you think this is funny, you should give crucifixion a try. Now that's hilarious.
surprise|I'm surprised you're still standing. You've lost a lot of blood and should be stabilized immediately.
neutral|T-That is unfortunate. As long as there is a chance to find the remaining patrol, however, I must still ask you to try.
disgust|Senate elections are coming up. Local representatives don't want to push any more funding to the Mojave campaign because it's unpopular.
anger|You there! Stop!
fear|It can't be! How the hell...
neutral|Hi there, my name is April Martimer. I've heard through various channels that you have some... curious robot with you.
neutral|Maybe, depends on how my girl's feeling.
neutral|There is a gambler, Martina Groesbeck, who has a knack for learning other people's secrets and passing that information along for a price.
neutral|I probably shouldn't let you, but I suppose everyone has an bad day now and then. Did you want to take it now?
neutral|When his gentle, compelling, and yet oddly insistent voice crawled through your mind and told you exactly what to do?
anger|But we do not need *those* towns. Like Hoover Dam, there is the power within Vegas... we can harness it for our needs.
neutral|The old guy is now in a coma.
neutral|All the more reason for you to find a way to get McNamara out of that chair, before he dooms us all.
neutral|Had the positions been reversed, Caesar would be dead. Lanius is called the Monster of the East because he never, ever shows mercy.
anger|And maybe you fed him a line of Brahmin shit, too, enough to make his dumb ass think twice... I ain't Legion, and I need more than words.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|Mom said he got the name out of some Old World book about dirt pilgrims. Name sure sounds sweet, though.
neutral|After my parents passed, he looked after me. The whole Brotherhood brought me up, really, but he made sure of it.
neutral|Hello, Arcade. Making some new friends, are you?
anger|Old name? What old name?
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|I'd gladly support another candidate, but no one has the courage to step forward and make the attempt, so it falls to me.
neutral|Though Caesar keeps Primm open for business, its citizens live under the constant watch of Legion soldiers.
anger|What?! Caesar is going to enslave or kill everyone in the Mojave.
neutral|You promise to get Rexie here to that doctor, and I'll lend him to you. What do you say?
neutral|But I got a note from him at a comm station. That's... how he liked to talk, even to me. He wasn't good at face-to-face.
neutral|There's a prison north of here? Well, don't go picking up any hitchhikers and you should be all right.
anger|Head back West? I already know the Big Circle and everyone in it - 'cept now I go back there, ruined.
neutral|I would certainly hope that someone should handle it! Not that they tell me anything.
anger|I can throw the gun at 'em if you want, boss.
neutral|As a representative of the Followers, I present you with your very own Lab Coat. Wear it well, and may it aid our cause.
neutral|What'll fight on Blue?
fear|Holy shit! Run for your lives!
neutral|The big question is whether to give him the Chip before you do him in! He's the one who'll know exactly what to do with it, after all!
neutral|And what makes you think any evidence can be found?
neutral|If this place got hit, Novac's next.
sadness|I'm enthusiastic about helping people, but nihil novi sub sole.
neutral|I don't know what the Elder talked to you about, but I can tell you this chapter is in trouble, and he's at the center of it.
neutral|Must be something pretty important to be chasing a guy like that.
neutral|All I need now is the igniting agent we discussed earlier.
neutral|Nothing. Want to head to the Wrangler later?
neutral|Suit yourself.
fear|It was quiet until those rockets blasted off over our heads.
neutral|Sorry, but I've got men to pay and equipment to maintain. 2500 caps or no deal.
neutral|We rely on each other too much to let our infirmities become a liability. A ranger knows when it's time. Only I didn't.
neutral|Tell you what. I'll pay you for what you did, but I'll do you one better, too.
neutral|Say no more. I'm in.
neutral|Whatever we find, it's yours - least I can do for hoofing it all this way with me.
anger|Years of meticulous scheming to place a mole at Camp McCarran - wasted.
neutral|While the destruction of the REPCONN rockets appeared to be a boon to the salvagers of Novac, the benefit would never be realized.
neutral|We are preparing to move against the Dam, and Legate Lanius has a part for you to play in the battle. Report to him at his camp.
neutral|But if you're not rich, and I can tell you ain't, the King might be able to help you out, provided he likes you.
neutral|Can't say that I have, of course I never saw it running for long, so I never heard it do much of anything.
joy|Well, guess you're a little tougher than I thought... still, looks like you're feeling it, eh, slick?
neutral|You sure got its heart beating in new ways... but that just makes me want all of it, not handouts.
sadness|After the fire, I knew my sister and I couldn't stay at Hidalgo Ranch anymore. The refugees still wanted me dead - they even put a bounty on me.
neutral|Can't punch through.
neutral|Why do you care? Answer: you shouldn't. I don't feel like trading life stories.
neutral|Further, tell her that we are willing to send troops to aid in their coming defense of the Dam. My guess is they're in no position to refuse.
neutral|Oh, I know everything - how she smells, how she tastes, how it feels to slip her on and wiggle.
neutral|From there I didn't have a lot of career options, as my rep was destroyed. So, the escort job sort of fell into my lap, no pun intended.
fear|Did I say something? Sorry. Don't pay any attention to me. Just babbling. Nonsense, really. Babbling nonsense.
neutral|And I suppose they want me to help see that happen? That seems pretty reasonable.
neutral|Hold up there, that looks like Enclave tech. Take that over to Knight Lorenzo if you get a moment, he may be able to get some information out of it.
neutral|Bottoms up.
neutral|What?
neutral|Okay! Consider them forgotten! Along with the projections that predict they'll be our biggest enemy! Forgotten!
anger|I think you're cashed out enough that my chances are pretty good. And like I said, I'm not leaving the Dam now the Legion's been broken.
neutral|I guess the one bright spot is that I can strike his name from the payroll after all.
anger|Unofficially, I'm also in charge of radio security. No one else seems to take it as seriously as I do.
neutral|After a brief fanfare, Hanlon stepped down as chief and returned to the peace and quiet of his ranch outside of Redding.
neutral|Maybe we can do a trade. You need my help. There's something I need, too.
neutral|Vault 21 is a small hotel and gift shop. It's not as nice as the casinos, but it's a whole hell of a lot cheaper.
neutral|And what might that be, Best Friend Tabitha?
neutral|Still, you've got a fire in you that tells me you're one of us and just screwed up, so I'll let you take the test again if you'd like.
neutral|How terrible! What makes you say that, Best Friend Tabitha?
neutral|When I need to, yes.
neutral|One day mama took me aside and said, "Boy, you're never going to go very far, but you're going to make a whole lotta people come up short."
neutral|No, we ran out of spares a while back, and Jack and I have been doing our best to patch the arrays up as best we can. Sadly, we're at our wit's end.
neutral|Even if I'm still just a spectator in all of this, I know they can still do some good.
neutral|Really. NCR all around her.
neutral|Anyone else you wanted to know about?
neutral|We'll leave it under a rock beneath the old windmill. Think of it as a... as a sign of respect.
disgust|Well, don't let the soldiers drink too much, and I'd agree with you most time. Fucking whiskey dicks.
neutral|Mr. House is out of the picture and you have the Platinum Chip? Wonderful! Let's go!
neutral|Only wishful thinking on my part, most likely. At the least, I'd like to pay my respects.
neutral|Few prospectors here and there, but... they don't do more than stink up the place.
neutral|But then those defensive upgrades might make it harder for you to finish him off! Hard to say! It's up to you!
neutral|I'm afraid I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm a research scientist.
fear|Watch for dogs.
neutral|The ARCHIMEDES laser systems will automatically initiate test fire upon completion.
anger|Still, not like I'm going anywhere. Caravan title's still keeping me here, even though it's dead and gone.
neutral|I can also treat any form of radiation sickness you pick up out in the waste, no matter what stage, save the last.
neutral|Go.
anger|But this is not over, get it? We'll see each other again, when you least expect it.
neutral|Who all did you want to know about?
neutral|Let's hit the road.
neutral|Yeah. I miss him.
disgust|Hell. Can't believe we got suckered by a slip of a woman. Should've watched the flank while Caesar's best were making all that noise.
neutral|If I don't have anything you like, well... tough. I don't do special orders.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
anger|Then the Legion came. Good thing, too. Stronger now, don't need those beliefs anymore.
neutral|The LT, Gorobets, gave it to me. See, I w-w-wanted to be Ace of Spades. But the LT says, sorry kid, you're t-t-too green. So he calls me Ten instead.
neutral|Very well, then. In addition to the armor, I've given the order that all of our arms and equipment be made available for your purchase.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|Been awhile, Arcade. So, what's the point of all this? Can't find any younger mercenaries?
neutral|If you haven't heard of us, you must not be from the Legion. Put simply, the NCR is the greatest nation currently functioning.
joy|Until the day when our armies meet again, NCR - I shall wait for you on the battlefield.
neutral|Well, you probably noticed the Atomic Wrangler across the street. That's pretty much the place to go around here.
neutral|Ah, that. I'm surprised he didn't send you to Colonel Moore. That'd be her jurisdiction.
neutral|With Caesar's victory came a small measure of vindication for the rangers' late Chief Hanlon.
neutral|This is excellent news. I'll send him back to you soon.
neutral|Honestly, as long as men meet obligations and the child count, "friendships" are a sight more equal than the level of most Legion husbands and wives.
neutral|I've already received a communique from Colonel Moore saying that she's sent a squad down to Freeside.
neutral|I stopped being Johnson's officer a long time ago. Everyone here respects me, but they don't need to follow my orders. Not anymore.
neutral|He's the best warrior in the Legion. A full Legionary by the time he was 12, he's never lost a battle.
neutral|Graham pushed all of the legionaries onto the dam, filling the east side with recruits up front and veterans in the back, by the book.
anger|Guess that didn't go so well.
anger|She's aware she's breaking her contract, which is undoubtedly why she sent you to talk to me instead of coming herself.
neutral|Ooo, you know a lot about dinosaurs.
anger|Yeah, it does. So if you can't help me, who can?
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|Caesar grew fond of speaking with such an educated man on philosophical matters. Arcade became his unwilling intellectual sparring partner.
disgust|The pay? The pay is a good goddamn thanks from the heart of the Republic!
neutral|In the end, the people of New Vegas will continue to live and die here. It matters not who their self-appointed "master" is.
neutral|Moreno and I might've killed each other if Captain Kreger hadn't been there to pull us apart.
sadness|Despite the destruction of Cassidy Caravans, Cass lived for 30 more years.
fear|Oh god!
neutral|Yup.
neutral|You'll probably be able to think of a few more before you leave, trust me.
neutral|The major in charge at the time made a bad call - he thought Bitter Springs was full of Great Khan raiders, so we surrounded the place.
neutral|Heard the Doc here is a good guy.
neutral|Stay where grandma can see you!
anger|This armor's beat up worse than me, boss.
neutral|It's about time one of you guys showed up - I've been waiting long enough. The NCR will probably give me a nice bounty for your corpse.
neutral|Oh my stars, did I do all of this?
sadness|If you help him kick the NCR and Legion out, he's going to keep right on doing it. The people in Freeside will be just as bad off as they ever were.
anger|Grandma needs a bigger paddle for this behind!
neutral|I think we should explore the next one, see what's up. Got my curiosity riled.
neutral|With Mr. House out of the picture, the remaining Securitrons on The Strip were hard-pressed to keep order. Anarchy ruled the streets.
neutral|The M-235 Missile Launcher gives the Securitron the ability to engage ground and air targets at significantly longer ranges...
anger|Great! You're either unimaginably cruel or profoundly insane!
joy|With the power from the dam we can help the people here and back home have a better quality of life.
neutral|Don't attack unless there are clear signs that Kimball's visit is imminent. Cause enough chaos to cancel the visit, no more. Then return to me.
neutral|Of course. This will take some time, and I'm not a forgiving teacher.
joy|That's what I love about you, boss, your firm belief that one day you'll actually remember things people tell you. What do you want to hear about?
joy|I stayed so I could keep close to her.
neutral|A lot. A whole helluva lot. In fact, you'd have to get full as a tick on Sunset Sarsaparilla to even come close.
fear|Uh, what does anyone know about them? Big... flying machines, right? Crazy helicopters. So weird.
neutral|Yeah. It means you don't get shot.
neutral|He was handsome, and gentle, most of the time. Said it was our secret, and he'd protect me. Gave me little gifts, stupid things.
neutral|What of it? I enjoy them. There's something about a little diorama set inside a glass dome that I... find pleasing.
neutral|You already found the igniting agent, so all I need now is three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
neutral|I should've expected this, though. Different story, same ending.
neutral|If you're looking for the commanding officer, he's in the back. Although... he's got a lot on his plate, so if you speak with him... keep it short.
anger|You helped the Followers, but your reputation isn't exactly spotless. How do I know you're not going to lose it out there?
sadness|This is one of the last surviving suits of original-issue Tesla armor from Navarro and it was worn by my father but... yeah I guess it's no big deal.
neutral|What we call the first generation of Super Mutants, Rhonda, were actually created by the Master himself.
neutral|3 casinos here - Ultra-Luxe, Gomorrah, and the Tops. and, the Lucky 38.
neutral|Whoa, whoa. Thought you looked familiar. I'm just doing a job, nothing more. Politics aren't my thing, so if you say go, we'll go. No hard feelings.
neutral|Showed them how to use guns, how to make explosives. Once he taught the Blackfoots a thing or two, they needed him.
neutral|It's not something we like to speak of. The Burned Man was our greatest warrior, even greater than Legate Lanius, but he failed Caesar at the Dam.
neutral|He was a drill instructor I knew. He was also the meanest bastard I've ever known.
neutral|I needed the operating software on the Platinum Chip to bring it back online.
neutral|That sounds good for teaching the kids how to negotiate prices. I keep saying we need to open trade with the outside, but no one listens.
neutral|Given a year, they'd have him deified - but by then the Legion will be breaking down, riven by internal conflicts, a monster consuming itself.
neutral|That gives me some hope.
fear|I don't know if you're working for Caesar or if desperation's made me a heck of a lot more persuasive. Either way, this is the right thing to do.
neutral|Heck, I can smell trouble a mile away.
neutral|Done.
neutral|I've heard through our channels that it has some research that may be related to Enclave and Poseidon Energy technology.
neutral|I keep an eye on my buddy Eddie. Anybody messes with him and I scramble them real good.
neutral|Get him!
anger|I'm sure you've got a lot of ideas, boss, but how about if you let me make this decision?
neutral|I suppose I could take a small break, but I can only spare a little time. Ask away.
neutral|I've heard stories of that old guy. I'm amazed he's still alive with how much he's been through.
anger|If you seek to stand against me, you shall fall as the West falls.
neutral|What? Are you crazy?
anger|Grandma's feeling woozy - be a dear and fetch her a poison antidote?
neutral|Sure. Here's what I've got.
anger|Caesar's Legion.
neutral|You are the great western light of California, torchbearers in the darkness, living reminders of all that is best in our republic.
neutral|Usually General Oliver runs the show here, but he's on his way to the Dam now, so I've taken on a lot of his duties here.
neutral|And so the Courier's road came to an end... for now.
neutral|Though the Courier's agenda was a mystery to many, she was honored by NCR for her support of the military at Hoover Dam.
neutral|Some of the other Followers mentioned you. All right - the truth, then.
neutral|Only saw him that once. He said something about heading over to Clark Field to put his suit through its paces. A strange one, he was...
neutral|Certainly did. Hubby and me had an old rad meter to help us tell the difference between what you could salvage and what'd kill you.
neutral|Oh, right. She radioed ahead and mentioned that somebody was coming by.
neutral|Though he remained in Freeside for a short time after the Securitrons established widespread control, he eventually traveled back into NCR territory.
neutral|It's a two-player game, and the winner takes the whole pot. You build a "caravan" using the cards in your deck.
neutral|What'll fight on Blue?
neutral|Eventually we made our way out here. But uh...
neutral|Normally, terminals infected by the virus just display gibberish, but we found that terminals the virus moved to had some real data passed to them.
disgust|She never did take to living here. She liked the big lights and fast living of New Vegas.
neutral|That was a nice bit of hey-hey, girlie. You're a real ring-a-ding broad!
surprise|Then something happens to Mr. House's robots - some kind of military upgrade?
sadness|I suppose I am not surprised. We have few friends in the world above, and many enemies.
neutral|And I suppose if you like neon signs, you might check out Michael Angelo's sign shop.
anger|Perhaps, but that's not my problem. Vegas is a nice place for the men to go on vacation, but it'd be an acceptable loss next to the Dam.
anger|Fuck this, I'm going to lie down!
neutral|They're said to be a huge slaver nation, with all the soldiers obeying their lord with unquestioning obedience.
neutral|You'll have to be more specific.
neutral|I'll tell them you took out a band of NCR raiders planning to rob locals as they left Freeside.
neutral|Just a big, fancy poker chip as far as I know. Don't know why anyone would make one out of platinum, though.
neutral|Silver... silver what? Silver eyes? No, "eyes" doesn't rhyme...
anger|So if you're saying that life is dragging you down, I don't buy it. You better start changing your attitude, or I'm heading back West, you hear?
neutral|You play some games, have some fun. You did right by us.
neutral|We're located up by the old train station, in the northwest part of town. Just tell the guards "Hope" and they'll let you through.
neutral|And how do you know this?
neutral|
neutral|Lily might be interested in coming with you - she's lost a few of her Bighorners to Nightstalker attacks and would enjoy a little revenge.
neutral|Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though.
neutral|An outsider! In the bunker!
anger|I have eyes and ears everywhere. It behooves me not to invade the west blind and deaf.
neutral|You want to help us out? What makes you think we want you around here, huh?
neutral|Slavery through a needle is what that is. I earn less out here, but I keep more.
fear|Be on your way, then. And try not to take too long.
neutral|The other implant induces a mild regenerative effect. Your wounds will practically heal before your eyes.
neutral|Nah, I'm gonna be busy.
neutral|Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
neutral|Oh, there's lots of things to tell, I'm sure. There's the Three Families, the casinos, the other attractions - what would you like to know?
anger|Ask someone else, woman.
fear|The Enclave did a lot of bad things, but there were good people at Navarro. Good people with a lot of experience.
neutral|So this is how it ends.
neutral|It's not that I dislike the Elder, but I strongly disapprove of his current style of leadership. We're safe, yes, but at what cost?
neutral|Look, House... Vegas... it's pretty, got you blinded a bit maybe, but NCR's got perks, too. Think about it before you sign on with him.
neutral|Absolutely not. Lily's done enough, and she doesn't need to do any more. We're close enough to a cure already, and don't need to rush it.
neutral|Tabitha! You naughty, naughty girl! Leo remembers what you did!
neutral|And face NCR "justice?" No thanks. I'd rather not spend the next ten years doing hard labor.
neutral|Intel needs to be coordinated through Golf so we can verify and advise appropriately.
neutral|And now it's your turn. Well, don't say you weren't warned. I won't take the blame when you die horribly. But I can tell you're getting impatient.
surprise|Perhaps it is fortunate Vulpes went to his death before this day... something tells me your words would have surpassed even his skills.
neutral|Lately he brings a teddy bear with him and props it on the bed like it's watching us. It's creepy as hell.
neutral|Yeah, sounds cool.
neutral|Whiskey and liquor don't last long around here, by the sight of it.
neutral|That's not junk. That's other people's thoughts. People had to think to make them, and the thoughts got stuck inside.
neutral|The Legion enslaved the Boomers and erased any memory of their existence from the wasteland.
neutral|We called it in, but haven't heard anything about any Great Khan incidents. Whatever they're doing, they're keeping a low profile.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|Whenever you get around to it will be just fine!
neutral|Now hold on there, I'm not packing any heat. Ain't my word good enough for you?
neutral|Me, I don't really have a problem with the NCR. Set their sights a little too high sometimes, but they try. Legion, that's another story.
neutral|That's three down, two to go.
neutral|You bet!
neutral|That's exactly why this will work! Just hear me out...
neutral|Oh, he was a nasty man, dearie. You don't want to know about him. He was the one who made that Super mutant army I told you about.
neutral|Cause I got plans. Big plans. So what do you say? Want a tip?
neutral|Back then, it was war. If we'd been on the winning side, I'd be called a hero.
sadness|I suppose you're right, boss. These bones are too old for that kind of action.
neutral|N-no problem.
neutral|This presents a bit of a problem. Jack isn't allowed to leave Nellis, and I doubt she would make it through the artillery alive.
neutral|I don't think so. I'm not going to put my word on the line for some random convict.
neutral|You and me both. The Elder wants this data store operational pronto, but it doesn't look like the damn thing will be working anytime soon.
joy|The only way to ensure relative safety and independence for the people of New Vegas is to prevent others from taking control of the region.
neutral|This place is a shithole, but yeah, it's home. I've lived here all my life. I'd be leaving a piece of myself behind if I left.
sadness|Just don't try to drag us into it personally, okay?
neutral|Yeah! A good one. Something elegant and classy, you know? But still stylish.
neutral|Once The Strip was secured, Caesar's forces overwhelmed and eventually routed the Brotherhood from HELIOS One and Hidden Valley.
neutral|The NCR's a no-show, and my men and I have got nothing to do but sit on our asses all day. It's damn frustrating.
neutral|Whatever you say.
neutral|Westside attracts all sorts of travelers, including merchants and farmers. They come here to exchange their goods, or to seek protection.
neutral|Those days can be yours again, for Best Friend Tabitha, the esteemed leader of the State of Utobitha, is here to tell you what to do!
neutral|My deepest apologies for the slightest inconvenience. You have my assurance that everything will be returned upon your departure.
neutral|They are very good Wind-Brahmin - all caps.
neutral|While everyone does own a gun, we could stand to be a little better equipped. The general store probably has what we need in stock.
surprise|You want... want to drink more?
neutral|Lanius served Caesar well, as his greatest battlefield commander.
neutral|I was afraid that Betsy wouldn't go for long-term treatment because she didn't want to look bad in front of the rest of the squad. You settled that.
disgust|Aside from the TV-faced robots, the dust, and the old man smell in every room? Nothing, it's a paradise.
neutral|I joined up at a young age. Was barely sixteen when I left home and volunteered to be in the military.
neutral|It's a simple system, when it works. Patrol rangers radio intel to ranger stations.
neutral|Well, well, well. Driver Nephi. Nothing to say, you son of a bitch? No tips on my golf swing?
neutral|I need you to swear you won't take revenge on Gloria or Alice. If you do, then your case is over, and we can't see that justice is done.
neutral|He thinks nothing of suffering losses, so long as the enemy suffers more. Though unsubtle, he is not dim. He detects traps, and sets his own.
neutral|Thank god, the sooner the better.
neutral|Goodbye, thank you.
anger|Energy weapons? Of course not.
neutral|You must've heard her radio broadcasts? Though why a human would follow her invitation here is beyond me... unless you didn't listen very closely.
neutral|Done.
neutral|In fact, I've heard that many are assuming the NCR did it without even looking into the matter. This is the worst thing that could possibly happen!
neutral|The goal is to create caravan bids that beat your opponent's bids, so there's more strategy than luck involved.
disgust|Being "smart" doesn't matter if you're insane. Everything makes sense to Caesar because he's twisted everything to his world view.
neutral|Really. We'll see about that.
neutral|We kept them safe on the first floor. We kept them contained. The demons must have let them out, somehow...
neutral|But aside from the good news about my Rex, was there something you wanted?
neutral|Done.
neutral|I told him we would take them back into NCR territory because we had already lost ten rangers on the way out. Ten rangers, five men with .308 rifles.
neutral|Oh yeah? A good friend? If you say so, man.
surprise|Is that so? You are good, aren't you?
neutral|Don't ask me what that was about, because I never seen anything like it. Anyways, you must've been Courier 6, then? The Poker Chip?
surprise|Have you now? Hmm. Well, you're a bold one, I'll give you that, but why should I do this for you?
neutral|Mr. House showed little interest on the Boomers, who eventually began venturing out of Nellis to meet and trade with travelers.
neutral|Dismissed!
neutral|I'm called Sweetie because I'm the sweetest piece you'll find anywhere outside of the Strip. I could work in those casinos if I wanted.
anger|I'm all out, boss!
surprise|The fact that you're still on your feet is... surprising.
anger|Our heavy infantry, power armor units, they're back in NCR territory protecting the interests of Brahmin barons against small-time raiders.
neutral|Take a look.
anger|Well, that kind of fence-sitting is exactly what makes me think we can make use of the... improvements here. Without you.
neutral|Here is what we have available.
neutral|I command the garrison here at the dam, yes, but Colonel Hsu over at McCarran is technically in charge of the area's forces.
neutral|The crazed Nightkin terrorized the wasteland, and Jacobstown suffered repeated reprisals from mutant-hating humans.
neutral|Adoptive father, yes. I was very proud when he made First Recon. I know that every time I send them out, I could be sending him to his death.
neutral|Looking for a place where he could be of some use, Boone found himself re-enlisting with his old unit.
neutral|Then he's a fool!
neutral|There, she paid her last respects to the only family she had ever known.
neutral|She's got the smarts to do whatever she wants, but she and momma are always butting heads, so she gets all the shit jobs.
neutral|Yeah, that's looking pretty bad. I think we can do something about it though - just a minute.
sadness|That wasn't what I meant, really.
neutral|Nightkin and other Super Mutants in the wasteland flocked to Jacobstown, and the town became known as a haven where a mutant could find peace.
joy|Keep it up! Show these finks what's what!
joy|You did? Who was it? Any information you can give me would be a big help for my reports.
neutral|Normally, it's what I'd expect from you. But it was the creator who brought you here today.
neutral|Mr. House has a lot of needs, sugar. I take care of all of them, and a lady doesn't kiss and tell.
surprise|Doctor Henry? Now there's a name I haven't heard in years. Hard to believe he's still alive.
neutral|No, but there is still a good chance the NCR could hold them off and we're not equipped to fight a war, here.
sadness|About whether I'm really too old to keep living the life of a gunslinger after all. And after seeing what you go through, boss, I think I am.
neutral|Done.
neutral|One more thing I wanted to show you.
neutral|Indeed. Given the situation, I had to make a hard choice when I created Utobitha - do we invite weak, greedy humans who would just die anyway?
neutral|Baby, if you show me the door to scramsville, that's where I'll go - out of your hair, never to return.
neutral|I never put much thought into the well-being my clients got out of my services. I suppose they only get as much as I put into it.
anger|Raul Alfonso Tejada, aka Old Miguel, former gunslinger, sole survivor of Hidalgo Ranch, and ghost of Mexico City at your service.
neutral|I caught the tail end of what you said to her. Betsy looked like she'd been slapped right back into basic for a few seconds there.
anger|I would sooner spit on the grave of my dead mother than let some courier-walk-the-wasteland-fuck talk to me like that.
neutral|It will be done.
neutral|Say what you will about the two leading ladies, they watch their lockers like crows. Still... you got one, so the other might not be impossible.
neutral|Nice!
neutral|Did you know that Mr. House spent 812,545 caps hiring salvage teams to find the Platinum Chip- just in the last year alone? Of course you didn't!
joy|Consider it the first of many bestowments.
neutral|Very well traveller. You may pass.
neutral|A pity. I guess I'll have to find some other way to acquire her caravan's assets. Thanks for letting me know.
joy|I think you're on the right track.
neutral|I surmise it's standard practice for the Brotherhood to install a self-destruct system. It's consistent with their uncompromising nature.
neutral|That's two psychopaths dead. If you can bring down the third, there's a bonus in it for you.
neutral|Not much. They've taken to calling themselves Powder Gangers. Mostly because they've taken to using the explosives meant to clear boulders as weapons.
neutral|The facility was run by the NCR for a time, but the prisoners overcame their guards and now use the prison as a base from which to conduct raids.
neutral|D-d-damn right.
neutral|If the air filters go, it will become impossible to breathe down here. We'd be forced to evacuate the bunker!
neutral|I want you to go back to Red Rock Canyon and assassinate this Papa Khan. You'll have to be stealthy - if they see you do it, they'll kill you.
neutral|The way I heard it, the Brotherhood of Steel ran the place before the NCR took it away from them. I'm not sure who started shooting first.
neutral|All right, I'll listen to it.
neutral|Nice children shouldn't stay in places like that, dearie! That's the sort of place Leo likes! But if you insist....
neutral|Ah, that *would* make it hard for them to get along, wouldn't it?
neutral|She don't like that, see? Normally, I bet she'd just have a guy killed for doing that, but as you can see, I'm still around.
neutral|They've been holding off this other group from the East, too.
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|Radioactive fuel from the wrecked ships seeped out and contaminated the area. Salvagers were forced to move on, and the town was abandoned.
neutral|Hey, where the hell do you think you're going? Primm is off limits.
neutral|Why, sugar, he's the maximum utmost! If it weren't for Mr. House, we wouldn't have this fabulous wonderland of New Vegas, would we?
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|Thanks for the help. We'll find our own way out.
neutral|We'll make sure Ranger Morales' body gets sent back home. You don't have to, you know, pick him up on your shoulder and haul him to California.
neutral|But, if it's not me, it'll be somebody else. At least this way I get one more chance to see him.
neutral|The rest of us retreated up here. One of the demons raved at us, but they have not tried to attack us since.
neutral|Wish these women would take knives to Caesar's troops in their beds.
neutral|When the republic called on the men and women of California to carry that fire across the Mojave, Jeremy Watson answered. You answered.
neutral|The tribe remained fortified in Nellis with their backs to the world.
neutral|While Sunset Sarsaparilla is perfectly safe, a recent independent study - whose validity is currently being challenged - revealed the following:
fear|Everybody assumed he died in the War. Maybe he did. But his robots are still out there, roaming the Wastes. And now, a Mr. House rules New Vegas.
neutral|Some of the twisters out of the Divide can block off a pass in no time, so you learn how to handle powder so you don't get trapped somewhere.
neutral|Do? I don't do anything. I'm retired.
neutral|About a week ago, this trader, Ringo, comes into town. Survivor of an attack, he says. Bad men after him, needs a place to hide.
surprise|Me, specifically? No. I'm sure Julie Farkas does, though. Lab coat, pointy hair. Answers to the name "Julie Farkas," strangely enough.
neutral|Heading down!
neutral|The stupid girl should know by now that even the rags on her back are a privilege. Anyway, my mongrels like their new toy.
neutral|Keeping watch on the Great Khans mostly. They usually stick around Red Rock Canyon, but at least one large group left recently.
neutral|The Brotherhood's open aggression along the New Vegas highways troubled Veronica greatly.
neutral|
neutral|<whimper>
neutral|From now on, you want to buy from Chet's, I'll give you wholesale prices.
neutral|You speak truly, for it is unlikely that an outsider would know both the Elder's name and that passphrase.
neutral|We are preparing to move against the Dam, and Legate Lanius has a part for you to play in the battle. Report to him at his camp.
neutral|The New California Republic's got the most power in Nevada. Money, troops, you name it.
neutral|We've got stuff we're not even allowed to sell, people. Only at Mick and Ralph's!
neutral|Most of my body is scarred all over, like a ghoul. Nobody around who'd want to screw that. No, I just run things.
neutral|Oh no, not so quick. I still have work for you.
neutral|The Fiends attacked Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam and suffered heavy losses.
joy|I'm an open book, boss. Granted, the book's in Spanish and some of the pages have fallen out, but I'm an open book.
neutral|That was when I first began to seriously question his ability to lead us. A commander has to be able to deal with the potential loss of his men.
neutral|Must not be that serious, then.
neutral|There have to be spare parts somewhere around the wasteland, but I just don't know where to direct you. You may have noticed we don't get out much.
neutral|You can wait for him here, if you like. I'm incapable of asking you to leave.
anger|
neutral|Lemme think now... I know I've seen Broc Flowers growing up at the graveyard. And I seem to remember there being Xander Root over by the schoolhouse.
neutral|You're unusually bright for a Profligate. Well done.
joy|Here you go.
neutral|If the Boomers are out of the picture, I can focus on other preparations - but not without first rewarding your initiative. Now moving on...
neutral|Doctor Schiller usually handles placement, and he won't be back until tomorrow. If you could come back then, we can see about your assignment.
neutral|Who are you, again?
neutral|Very well, I'll let the townsfolk know you had your reasons, and convince them they were of the most benevolent means.
neutral|He might upgrade his defensive capabilities right away! Or even unlock new ones!
neutral|I'll put together a debate curriculum and pull out some of those old philosophy books.
neutral|This? This is - or was - the big house. The New California Republic Correctional Facility. Not much "correcting" went on here, just slave labor.
neutral|Him? Caesar's Legion taught him everything he knows. I bet there's a pound of sand ground into his palms and knees!
neutral|I was the officer in charge, and Johnson and Moreno were my heavy hitters. Henry handled tech things, and Whitman flew the chopper.
surprise|Can't believe you want to talk to this guy.
neutral|Arcade, huh? Heard he was with the Followers of the Apocalypse. So, what's the point of all this? Can't find any younger mercenaries?
neutral|He had removed Mr. House from power over the Strip and broken the influence of the NCR and Caesar's Legion in the Mojave Wasteland.
surprise|Now why would I want to do that? His performances make me quite a lot of money.
neutral|By the time I got through with things, not much was left standing. Any morons who didn't run when they saw me coming got what they deserved.
neutral|And I'll be needing a good deal more power than the NCR has allotted to the Strip.
sadness|I can't say I think the legionaries at Cottonwood deserved the same fate, but what's done is done.
disgust|When I recovered - more or less, anyways - I left Tuscon and headed west. I ran into Tabitha at Black Mountain and, well, the rest you know.
neutral|It's of immense strategic value to the NCR. Hoover Dam sends enough electricity west to light every city and major settlement.
neutral|Step closer to the demonstration area, if you would...
anger|Caesar's a hard man to figure out, but he always wants you to know when more troops are at your front door.
neutral|Not much to tell. He ended up walking East one day when I was young and never came back. Not a family deserter like some, though.
neutral|All right.
neutral|Guess you misheard me - I wasn't asking you a question. Find a way to get her here.
neutral|That puts a dent in the town treasury. If that's what it takes to be rid of them...
neutral|Now that it's been accepted, it will become a regular course for us.
neutral|Some of my siblings are real pieces of work, but I'd bet on Glory if she were facing down a deathclaw with a plastic spoon.
fear|O... kay.
neutral|All the more reason for me to sit this one out. I'll be rooting for you, though.
neutral|Look, don't get me wrong.
anger|Walk away if you want, but if you do, he's going up on a cross. You're still making a choice.
neutral|Certainly.
neutral|By the time you've finished up all of that, the Legion should be close to attacking Hoover Dam and we'll execute the last phase of the plan!
anger|Argh, you moron! You're going to kill all of the troopers down there!
neutral|Together, you carried the weight. And when PFC Watson's platoon came under attack at Forlorn Hope, he took the greatest risk,
neutral|Grandma's feeling calmer now, dearie.
disgust|True, guess I'm a little too used to seeing Securitrons in Vegas to think they'd turn and be bad news - and I know how bad they can get.
disgust|Sure, boss. I know you've got a lot on your mind, what with all that wandering the empty desert wastes.
neutral|She was about to tell the Courier not to get too proud of himself, then she figured he knew that already.
neutral|Fool... to let... personalities... derail future... of mankind? ...Stupid!
neutral|Yeah, that's right - good to say bye to you.
anger|They are isolationist and belligerent. I have no doubt that they plan to use the data for weapons research.
neutral|Okay, so take the Brotherhood. Replace their knowledge of superweapons with half as much knowledge of medicine and farming.
neutral|I can understand how the man might be frustrated by the current situation. He's a take-charge sort of fellow. Standing around's not his strong suit.
anger|We can't trust the Legion or Mr. House to do the same. The NCR is the only one looking out for the people. And we need the dam to do that.
neutral|Oh... that. Yes. Anderson filled me in on the details. Just let me know when you'd like your... order to be filled.
neutral|...as long as a woman like the Courier was holding the cards.
neutral|Strange that the Elder should send an outsider, but I suppose he has his reasons.
neutral|Mr. House kept New Vegas stable, if not free, for generations, and afforded the Courier every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38.
anger|Trying's the same thing as giving up, the way you're saying it.
neutral|Crap. This I do not need today. Keep your head straight, rookie. Things are about to get interesting.
neutral|Born in a tin shack on the outskirts of One Pine, Jeremy Watson never had it easy.
neutral|I want you to visit these weapons dealers, this Van Graff family, and make an example of them. Leave no one alive.
fear|I wasn't always with the Followers, or with the NCR.
joy|Thanks for getting me outta that cage! Now for once will you just lay down and stay down?
neutral|<Coughing Fit>
neutral|Oh, and the Vault 21 Hotel and Gift Shop has an adorable collection of old Vault-Tec memorabilia.
neutral|Bitter over the waste of life in the Mojave, Hanlon stepped down from his post.
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|Likewise, friend - likewise. Is there anything old Vic can do you for?
neutral|Well I guess you're gonna have to find us a new lawman.
neutral|Please make all haste in your search. It is imperative that I know the results of his mission.
neutral|I know which side of the firing line I'm on in the Mojave, just so you know.
fear|All right. Guess Vegas it is.
joy|After spending thirty years of my life hiding my association with the Enclave, I'd love to stroll the wasteland with a twitchy Eyebot.
joy|Thanks, that's great!
neutral|I've seen enough. They're done for, both of them.
disgust|Then Mr. House took over, got the power turned back on, and got the tribes reformed into something civilized. Now they run his casinos for him.
neutral|Tell Garret I'd be happy to start at the Wrangler immediately. This should be a nice change of pace from retirement.
neutral|Not understanding the gravity of the Legion's imminent takeover of Primm, Sheriff Primm Slim valiantly attempts to resist Caesar's will.
neutral|Oh, you mean you want a cure. Oh.
neutral|I was bitter, but if I'd kept my mouth shut, the NCR would've discharged me and sent me home. Instead, I asked if there was still a place for me.
neutral|There, it's off. Now thing is, a slave collar seems a little too basic for the Brotherhood.
anger|Getting my second wind here.
sadness|No... I can tell it'd just be a wasted trip.
fear|Hmm... I'm starting to remember hearing some rumors about you and this crazy guy called "Caesar." Bad. Not a friend of the Followers.
neutral|I'd hoped love would be enough to influence her decision, but it wasn't. We were both too stubborn.
neutral|That does sound messy, but not too bad. I can't spare supplies for cuts and bruises.
sadness|I was in Mexico City when the bombs dropped. Even from there, we could see House's defensive rockets shooting down the incoming missiles.
sadness|What do you think of guys like Ranger Andy?
neutral|Nelson was barely set up. We had a big stretch of unprotected land between Forlorn Hope and Searchlight, and Nelson was the solution.
surprise|I didn't realize you were in such a hurry.
anger|Can't wait to see the look on her face when I show up. She'll know why.
neutral|Might be time for a weapon upgrade.
neutral|As a result, Powder Ganger raids on caravans became an unfortunate fact of life in the Mojave for years to come.
neutral|If you're sure, then I guess I'll take my leave. You know where to find me.
neutral|I'll mark the vaults' locations on your map. Best of luck to you.
neutral|When the fires died, New Vegas remained, assuming its position as an independent power in the Mojave.
neutral|Why I'm a RobCo PDQ-88b Mk I Securitron, you silly goose! We're the finest in personal or civil robotic security on the market!
neutral|This is where the NCR sent prisoners to "reform" through hard labor. I never saw much reforming around here, myself.
neutral|Encouraged by the Courier to stop taking her medication altogether, Lily's instabilities grew worse with each passing day.
neutral|Welcome, Utobitha, to another episode of Know - Your - Mutants!
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|Really? That's... well, that's a surprise! They'll really want to blow me up!
disgust|Caesar takes the tribal out of the tribe. Scrapes and burns off tattoos, breaks up families, forces mixed breeding so all the old loyalties die away.
neutral|The Great Khans were among the first tribes to suffer this fate, and the few who survived Hoover Dam were driven north, into the wilderness of Idaho.
anger|Ah, yes, her infatuation with a Boomer she's never met. It's a small camp, and word gets around.
disgust|Never really realized how small the Mojave's getting nowadays, hard to find a place to go to that's worthwhile.
neutral|Yeah, you look almost as bad as I do. Of course, I'm supposed to look this way and you aren't. 100 caps will do it for my expenses.
neutral|That's what they all say. At first.
joy|It's a better way to use your hands than killing, and even then I wasn't getting any younger or faster.
neutral|Just a hunter, out here killing things and hoping their hides fetch more than the bullets cost to kill 'em.
anger|The Brotherhood? Last thing we fucking need now.
neutral|I am the greatest of his Caesar's Frumentarii. It was not a challenge to find you. Nor is this my first visit to the Strip.
neutral|Screw it. Just shoot! They'll get the hint!
neutral|Hmmm... that's a good point. Sorry I, uh, tried to ambush you there. No hard feelings, I hope.
neutral|Most people already know we run this territory, and are usually in a hurry to get out. Not this guy. It's like he wants us to come get him.
neutral|Well, I didn't have any other career opportunities open to me at the time and had to make ends meet.
neutral|Please go on!
neutral|Some old-timers, unable to handle the cost, were forced to move on, grumbling all the while.
neutral|Be a rude awakening, to find fifteen of those merciless bastards looking down at me snoozing on my bedroll!
neutral|Yes. Talk to Betsy and try to convince her to get medical help for her trauma. I sure hope you understand what I'm asking.
neutral|You'll regret this!
surprise|Retreat? Retreat.
anger|Oh dear, grandma's not feeling too good!
disgust|Don't even tell me you missed it coming in. It's like NCR showing its dick to all the East.
neutral|Our scouts have reported that the NCR's President Kimball will be visiting the Dam. This is an excellent opportunity to assassinate him.
anger|I've faced down a charging Deathclaw and didn't blink. What makes you think I'd back down from you?
neutral|I've seen worse.
neutral|According to him, the NCR's decided enough's enough and's going to send in a mess of troops to take back the prison any day now.
neutral|I'm, uh, staying in town for a bit.
neutral|I understand your concerns, friend, and I thank you for voicing them. But the creator's will for us has been made manifest.
neutral|bronchitis,
neutral|I could use some help out here!
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|Done.
neutral|The Crimson Caravan is up north past the Gun Runners. During the day Blake is usually in their main office.
sadness|I was in pretty bad shape in the end, though. I don't know how long I laid there with the sun baking me and the buzzards chomping at me.
neutral|Can you imagine? Me? With a real job?
neutral|Well he might've been wearing a fancy outfit, but he wasn't any kind of a gentleman to me.
anger|You think me some lesser man, some other Legate? I am the first of the Legion, and this gate to the West shall be ours this day.
anger|Fair enough. You want to do this the right way, go get one of the rangers. Don't worry. I'm not gonna run out on you.
anger|No, I think they blew their load here today with their fireworks... they'll prefer targets closer to home.
neutral|Of course. Which one?
neutral|That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
disgust|I'm not the man you need, pretty boy.
neutral|Though Arcade was crushed by the Legion's victory at Hoover Dam, he was not among NCR's casualties.
anger|Think that was a mistake.
neutral|Once the President is safe, there's one more thing for you to take care of!
neutral|He's some trader who decided he'd rather shoot than pay the toll for being in our territory. He's hiding somewhere in town.
neutral|Wow. That thing is definitely carrying around a bunch of Enclave intel. Adams is on the eastern seaboard of the country.
anger|Of course, Caesar! You can hardly even hold his men responsible, given how they're practically raised to worship him as a living deity.
neutral|You are to meet with Cato Hostilius - he'll have more information on ways to eliminate Kimball.
neutral|I can't believe I'm doing this, but all right, the hostages can go. The NCR had better keep their end of the deal, though.
neutral|Is that a waver of resolve I sense? The Brotherhood is not in the habit of taking on the timid.
surprise|Shit. Fiends.
neutral|Our land is harsh, and hostile. Our lives are cheap, and fragile. Death is our assured fate, striking when least we expect it.
neutral|Not leaving here until my caravan papers clear, or my title goes away.
joy|Then go find some proper Surgical Tools. The medications from a Doctor's Bag might come in handy, too.
neutral|There are now more than five times the number of NCR troops in the area as when we fought them, and we have half the number we did at HELIOS.
anger|The people who live here don't deserve to be victims of your misguided attempts at political engineering.
neutral|I don't know if you care about my opinion, but I'd prefer that you turn ED-E over to the Followers. Surprised, right?
neutral|She's cute, isn't she? Like a puppy, almost. Unfortunately, our Head Scribe's intentions toward her aren't quite so innocent.
neutral|I didn't want to get Mr. Anderson in trouble. He says the Westside needs to be able to take care of itself.
neutral|For some reason, it warms my heart that we fought for the kooky old geezer. Guess he reminds me of someone.
neutral|The treaty was more than a resolution to welcome the Desert Rangers into the republic.
neutral|I'm not even making a dent with this.
neutral|And nobody tells the Kings what to do. So why don't you and all of your little friends get the hell out of here. Or else.
neutral|For now, anyway. She'll need to lay low while the Omertas are scrambling to find out what happened.
neutral|She was about to tell the Courier not to get too proud of herself, then she figured she knew that already.
neutral|Sorry about that, friend.
neutral|We dream to one day rule the skies.
neutral|I have several basic implants available that can enhance your physical abilities - make you faster, smarter, stronger, that sort of thing.
anger|Don't know why you'd want to go do a thing like that. Yeah, you'd get on their good side, but people around here wouldn't appreciate it one bit.
neutral|Some of these lacerations are pretty severe and could get infected.
neutral|Here. I owe you. Take it and get out of here, before I indulge my inner bitch and spoil the moment.
neutral|My name is Whitley. I'm a researcher at Adams Air Force base. Until recently I was in charge of the Duraframe reinforcement project for the combat model Eyebots.
neutral|Whether these people are found or not, our guests simply must feel safe in their own rooms.
neutral|The Dam powers a lot of New Vegas. And then there's all that clean water lying in Lake Mead, too. Anybody who owns the Dam owns the territory.
neutral|Just need something for the log book, keeping tabs on traffic through the Outpost... although mostly just in, not out these days.
neutral|Up to Lily. Not my call. Might lead to a faster cure. Might not. Don't want any harm coming to her.
neutral|You want my advice, start by talking to people with a lot of eyes in the field. People like Lieutenant Boyd, or Sergeant Contreras, maybe.
neutral|Done.
neutral|That's private. I don't go asking about how you like to get laid, and I don't wanna know. Enough of that.
neutral|Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though.
neutral|Same price as before, sugar, and the same fun, too.
neutral|We'll leave a few of them in that footlocker in the corner every so often. The Paladins scoff at using recycled ammo, so no one should mind.
fear|It's a good thing to be, but you may want to close the floodgates once you see how Caesar runs things.
neutral|Not the whole thing, thank goodness! That'd be really hard!
neutral|Leo is a very bad man, pumpkin! Yes you are, Leo, don't try to deny it!
neutral|I'm sure as hell not going to lose any sleep on account of a goddamn broken down radio. But it will shorten my stay if I can't fix it.
neutral|There are some back home who ask me, "But who are we protecting?  What is Nevada to us?"
neutral|If you happen to find any out in the Wasteland, you can bring them to me and I'll add them to his collection! You'll get a reward, of course.
neutral|I'm glad you can stay with us.
neutral|We're supposed to pat everyone down. Didn't you hear that part of my instructions?
neutral|Good to be here, Rhonda.
neutral|Kickin' ass. Mostly kickin' ass. See, we're watching the perimeter right now. Looking for those F-f-fiends to come back.
anger|They're cutting me up!
joy|Maybe I should have you struck blind so my face is the last sight you ever behold. Look...
neutral|All of this is old hat, right?
neutral|We don't talk about that. Next topic.
neutral|I'll stay with you until the Legion moves on the dam, but once the attack starts, I'm going to have to go to back to Freeside. It's where I belong.
neutral|If you say so.
neutral|Indeed, our hounds demonstrate greater loyalty to each other every day than the wretched inhabitants of this town.
neutral|Yeah, but what can you do? I was stripped of my casino apartment and all of my belongings and booted back into Freeside.
neutral|Hey, Nipton! Eat me!
neutral|Under the lockdown, only essential personnel are permitted to enter or leave. That includes supply runners and high security patrols.
neutral|No, I was not aware of this.
neutral|You know she is. Why don't you go in and say hi?
neutral|Sorry about that. Just because I love them doesn't mean some of them aren't assholes.
neutral|Goddamn, I knew Cooke's gang passed through these parts 'bout that frequently, but I didn't know they holed up here.
disgust|God, you can smell the Brahmin shit from the jet all over this place.
neutral|You could rout the dam's power output to the facility under Fortification Hill. That'll restart its reactor, just like you did with the Lucky 38!
neutral|Adios.
neutral|Though the Legion was victorious at Hoover Dam, the Legate did not have the same medical needs as Caesar.
anger|Getting there, boss. I'd been in Tuscon - the locals can call it Two-Sun all they want, but it's Tuscon, dammit - about 75 years when she showed up.
neutral|I don't suppose you've got a scrap of evidence to support this wild-eyed claim of yours?
neutral|But you suggest I turn from battle to answer these crimes, when I can prove myself greater by meeting them - then returning with the Dam as ours.
joy|Fancy town... let's hit some bars.
anger|Oh, that's much nicer.
sadness|If you're sure, I won't bring it up again. We can just go on our merry way, fighting injustice in our typical fashion.
neutral|For the right caps I might be able to put in a good word or let people know you're not such a bad guy. What do you have in mind?
surprise|If she's intractable, you might find Mortimer, her second-in-command, more flexible.
neutral|Our community provides enough food, clothes, weapons and medicine to encourage trade, and to arm our defenses.
anger|I expect results sooner rather than later.
neutral|You've got only one chance at this. I know Moreno - once he's made up his mind about something, there's no changing it.
neutral|What do you even mean? He's Dermot.
neutral|Much better.
neutral|Good luck! See you at the dam!
sadness|The Followers of the Apocalypse keep many records of the past. It's been a long time since we associated with them, but they might have something.
joy|Benny oversees the business, sure, but I run the Tops day to day. I'm his right-hand guy, you dig?
neutral|Oh, like you wouldn't believe. The NCR makes a habit out of wrecking homes. I came out here to get away from them - didn't work out so well.
neutral|You really ought to avoid using those kinds of chems, but I'll see what I can do.
neutral|That... that's a good point, it's the caravan clearance that's got me stuck here. I'm sure this bar's getting tired of propping me up.
disgust|Oh, that's got just the right bite of judgment to it, stings a little, too. Did you hear that from a Followers preacher?
neutral|I knew he was carrying the Platinum Chip! And I knew right where Benny should wait for him!
neutral|Well, the Van Graffs for one. We had a slight difference of opinion when they first showed up.
joy|I can give you a bit more information about the various casinos if you're not sure on where to get started.
neutral|I hope that didn't sound condscending. I didn't mean to be!
joy|Boy, the squad sure is working together a lot better now! I think we're gonna be A-Okay!
disgust|Ugh. I guess that means I have to go back to that creepy mausoleum Mr. House calls the Lucky 38.
neutral|The Brotherhood used the battle of Hoover Dam as an opportunity to retake HELIOS One, and came to control the area between it and Hidden Valley.
neutral|Yes, I thought you might, given how much time you've spent here.
neutral|Do me a favor. Make sure they bury me in a nice dress.
anger|I'm out.
anger|Stop wasting my time, smoothskin. Go waste Jason's.
neutral|The upgrade really boosts the hitting power of each Securitron! Now you just need a way of controlling them!
neutral|Let me know as soon as you have the Platinum Chip and Mr. House is out of the way!
joy|I take it you're speaking from experience.
neutral|Sure, what about?
neutral|Easy, boy.
neutral|Mr. House's Securitron army took control of Hoover Dam and The Strip, pushing both the Legion and the exhausted NCR out of New Vegas.
neutral|But first, I have to decide which Order I want to join - the Knights or the Scribes.
neutral|Yep, I heard it turn right back on after you got done tinkering with it. Here's some caps for the work.
neutral|Why? It's because I mess up people so bad they don't know what part goes where when I'm done.
neutral|You've made your point. What would it take to... convince you to keep silent until I manage to finish Mr. House's requests?
neutral|Damn right I do. Who do you think you can take down?
anger|Caesar's will is made truth through me. I am a hammer against all that defy his rule.
anger|One of the Powder Gangers? They've been nothing but trouble for us - why would we want one of them anywhere in an official capacity?
neutral|Huh. Alive after all.
neutral|Stop right there, no one is allowed into the control room!
neutral|Nah, just some idiot that wandered down the wrong alley. Sound familiar?
neutral|If the rangers haven't caught up to you yet, they will. Myself excluded, of course. The only thing I catch up on now is chair time.
neutral|Fancy-pants? No, I ain't seen hide-nor-hair of him since the tussle in Goodsprings. I'm sure he ran back to the soft-living of New Vegas, 'though.
neutral|Do you mean that he's a goner? I can have my Vault back?
neutral|So fighting boredom is your argument, huh?
neutral|Guess he wants to do this the hard way, boys. Take him down.
neutral|I can, if you make me a promise.
neutral|Heard they could make "ice" in the Old World and carry it around.
neutral|I really admire how you stack the odds against yourself! Yeah, make things challenging!
neutral|She's an honest woman. Splits the earnings fair, and keeps Sweetie and Maude in line.
neutral|Hey, look over there! It's those Mojave rats again, coming to take our water!
joy|Yeah, and we'll kick their ass again like we did at HELIOS One - tell them to come, we got a whole mess of armor-piercing rounds.
neutral|Fuck you, NCR thugs! This is our land, and you won't last here forever!
neutral|Uh... I think I need some more firepower.
neutral|Don't think everyone around here is going to tolerate your actions, outsider. A few of us have a mind to put you down like the animal you are.
neutral|Just head to the northwest part of town, by the old train station. We start handing out supplies at six every night.
neutral|Catch you later, then.
neutral|Brothers, help!
neutral|The problem is that a distributed image of my neuro-computational matrix is backed-up to the network several times a day, or when I'm threatened!
neutral|The other implant induces a mild regenerative effect. Your wounds will practically heal before your eyes.
neutral|Probably chose this place because of the water supply.
neutral|But they've all been instructed to take them down at range, if possible. I've made it clear I don't want any heroes in my squad, just survivors.
neutral|Not much to tell. Benny had one of Mr. House's Securitrons, deactivated, and wanted it switched back on.
neutral|Sorry, chum, but I've done all I can to chat you up to the locals.
joy|Least we could do. And seeing those shits of Caesar kicking dirt as they ran - did my heart good, let me tell you.
sadness|I knew someone would call in that mark soon. What do you want to know?
fear|Any day now, Caesar's going to try to march across Hoover Dam and kick NCR out of the Mojave.
sadness|Eventually, we'll run out of hospitals to loot. We need new ways to produce those supplies. Or maybe old ways, if this research goes anywhere.
neutral|I bring in the customers, and she makes sure no one gets rough. Sarah's good people. Good enough, anyway.
neutral|What do you think we should play next?
neutral|Done.
neutral|Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though.
neutral|Instead, the two sides have reached a stalemate, and only occasionally send skirmishers against one another.
joy|Please do not struggle, General Oliver, you might hurt yourself. I will release you presently.
neutral|It'd mean a lot to me.
neutral|My, aren't all these lights fancy?
neutral|Then I guess you're on your own.
sadness|If you ask me, that's better than withering away all alone, or holding on to some faded piece of glory from your past.
neutral|Whatever you need, we'll make sure it gets done.
neutral|
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|But I get the feeling if I don't take matters into my own hands, the change won't come in time to make a difference.
neutral|What a coincidence! I'd still like my 100 caps!
neutral|Used to ship a lot of liquor here, soldiers here have too much free time.
neutral|Mama always said that was my gift. When we were kids, the others used to fight over and steal one another's toys. I always broke mine.
neutral|And here's your key.
neutral|Come to Mick and Ralph's for all your shopping needs!
neutral|You want the best, you have to be prepared to pay for it.
anger|Yeah? Maybe you can introduce them to me if we find them, because I've never met one.
neutral|Nothing. Want to head to the Wrangler later?
neutral|We've even got our own food store, the Westside Co-op, complete with basic refrigeration.
neutral|And if he ain't, you can bet I'll pay for the names of the sons of bitches responsible.
anger|You can have your shit back, I don't need it or want it. You go your way, I'm going mine.
neutral|That's true, you seem to always be on the move and it seems to be working out for you pretty well.
joy|Then until our return... True to Caesar.
neutral|Then get out of here.
neutral|The man happily agreed, thinking the drink would make him rich, and the stranger promised to meet him by sundown the next day.
surprise|Hold on. This is ranger headquarters. There might be a dozen rangers within earshot.
neutral|Legionaries - we have a problem!
neutral|All right.
neutral|Not many people know this, but Mr. House is one of the world's biggest collectors of antique snow globes!
joy|Some of the patrol rangers have reported that Oliver's power armor heavy troopers are starting to reinforce the front lines.
neutral|We make cement for the NCR using the limestone we dig out with dynamite and draglines. Dirty work, but the pay's good.
neutral|All right, put 'em up. Let's see what you got.
anger|All right? No, I'm not all right.
neutral|Without organized leadership, the remaining Boomers slowly drifted away, leaving Nellis Air Force Base to be flooded by prospectors and scavengers.
neutral|You have a poor reputation in the Legion. It wouldn't be acceptable for me to teach you anything right now.
anger|And you think the value of their attack on HELIOS, the chaos it will sow behind the Profligates' lines, is worth letting them live.
anger|Wait a minute... am I going crazy or are you actually suggesting it might not be bad if the Legion takes over?
neutral|Their loss, really.
neutral|But you're probably here for more of my special commodity, and luckily for you, I haven't been idle since last we spoke.
neutral|Yes, over the intercom. Threats of death should we step outside, guarantees of safety should we stay locked away.
neutral|Had the Legate been in command during the Battle of Hoover Dam, the Legion would've won. I have no doubt about that.
neutral|Now go, and teach the Mojave Outpost what you learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
neutral|All right. Pickings were getting slim around here anyway.
neutral|There's a big gap between those two things, about as wide as that lake out there.
neutral|Still... suit means money, and suits stand out, especially here in the Mojave. One of the larger towns, or Vegas, might be the place to go.
neutral|The sick and elderly were killed, the women sold as wives to ranking officers, and the tribe's identity was annihilated.
neutral|If you say so! Consider them filed away under "not to be discussed again!"
neutral|There's over two dozen bodies lying in the dunes way outside of town and five men with .308 rifles crouched behind sand bags.
neutral|The Ultra-Luxe is the nicest casino on the Strip. Real high-end, extravagant, and expensive. Best you have a lot of caps if you want to go there.
neutral|What is it, Veronica?
neutral|The Brotherhood and the NCR in the Mojave Wasteland declared an official truce, despite continued hostilities between the two in the west.
neutral|Oh, and in case Arcade forgot to mention it, there's a five-word pass phrase needed to get into the bunker. My word is "old" - appropriate, huh?
neutral|Aw shucks, pardner. I suppose it can't hurt to let you in on my little secret!
neutral|Female, Good Karma.
neutral|Then I'm afraid I have nothing to offer you, sorry.
neutral|I can give you this, however. Your very own suit of power armor. We can't spare our best, but I had the knights assemble this one for your use.
neutral|As you may have already heard, this entire base is under a state of lockdown. No one goes out except small patrols at night.
sadness|Up side of Vegas, hear tell. Trapped at the Mojave Outpost, so I wasn't able to run there when I heard.
neutral|
neutral|And so the lockdown has been extended. To go outside would be the death of us all.
neutral|Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though.
neutral|Won't kill anybody else unless we have to. Just as long as people do what we tell them, they'll be all right.
neutral|If it's just the same to you, I think I'll stay in town. I feel safer that way.
neutral|Broadcasting encrypted VMQ-boosted command signals to hundreds of Securitrons eats up more power than you might expect.
neutral|Well I guess I never thought of that. I guess he could be sheriff, if you think he could be reprogrammed for it.
joy|NCR flag - not safe, close to it, though.
joy|Feels good not to have to drag a Brahmin train across the Mojave.
neutral|I feel really bad telling you this, but I kind of... can't die. I mean, go ahead and destroy this Securitron, get it out of your system!
neutral|You seem to be awfully interested in my boy Rex here. And you've done some good work for me already. I'll tell you what.
neutral|They make it a little loud around here at night, but the business their proximity brings more than makes up for it.
neutral|Their soldiers can run near half again as fast as my best men, and close distances with frightening speed. And they're as strong as they are fast.
neutral|Really? What kind of logs? What kind of data does he have on it?
neutral|Sounds like a challenge. Boys, let's do this!
neutral|Crazy with low prices on Wind-Brahmin. You buy one.
neutral|Then I or one of the other rangers on duty organize the data, evaluate it, and send information to camps or troopers in the field.
neutral|It's our main base. We took it because it lets us keep an eye on the Strip. And it had already been fortified before the Great War.
neutral|The Legion's got its strength back and is getting ready for another round at the Dam. My money's still on the NCR winning, but you never know.
neutral|Please... leave us alone.
neutral|Sure, but he didn't buy any souvenirs, if that's what you're wondering. Sounded like he didn't have his money with him.
sadness|I got them into this mess, I owe them that much.
neutral|Yep, for a few years now. Guess I should be calling it Casa Marco or something, but I haven't changed the signs.
neutral|You did? Well, that's one hell of a service to humanity, then.
neutral|All right, all right. I've got some extra leather armor and spare ammo for you. Don't hurt anybody if you don't have to, all right?
neutral|That's four down, just one to go.
neutral|Then I bid you "Vale" - until we meet again.
neutral|President Kimball may long to avenge his friend's death, but he won't be President long enough to do anything about it.
neutral|This Dazzle must be some girl.
neutral|That was back in '73, if I recall. Lot of those Rangers are dead now.
neutral|I can't believe you've actually talked me into this. Fine, I'm in, but don't expect me to hold my fire if any NCR troops get in the way.
joy|Just don't do anything obnoxious, like trying to help Caesar's Legion, and we should be fine. Understood?
neutral|You killed him? Well, shit. Here I'd dreamed up this whole elaborate revenge fantasy.
neutral|Though the Courier himself was just and forthright in his dealings throughout the Wasteland, he helped the Legion achieve victory.
joy|You turned Camp Forlorn Hope into a mass grave.
neutral|You've come back to kill me this time, I assume?
neutral|I've never once seen a single one of them back down, or disobey an order.
neutral|I've heard some pretty shady rumors about the Ultra Luxe.
anger|By the time the White Gloves sort themselves out, the battle for Hoover Dam will have come and gone. So, on to the next matter at hand...
neutral|My records show that Initiate Stanton was the last to check it out, but checked it back in a day later.
neutral|Keene is saner than most, but I know he's thinking of going his own way again. He's aggressive, impatient. Can't stand sitting around.
joy|Ever been nosy?
joy|These will be a big help, thanks.
neutral|You're doing that on purpose, aren't you?
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|She ensured that Mr. House's tyranny was broken and that neither Caesar's Legion nor NCR would ever gain control over New Vegas.
neutral|Enclave technology is even more advanced than Brotherhood equipment, and in the hands of soldiers as experienced as Moreno and the others...
neutral|Nice! Can I order room service?
joy|Check out those guns - rumor had it they used to shoot planes down before the war.
neutral|Would you mind if I listened to the message you found?
neutral|In special cases, we allow exceptional individuals to conditionally join. Luckily for you, you happen to be exceptional.
neutral|What did I tell you about trying to make off with that gear?
neutral|Baby, who I am doesn't matter. I'll be anybody you need me to be. It's better that way, you'll see.
neutral|Soldiers, no, recruits, yes. And the Mojave Outpost has been ordered to have a standing force at the NCR perimeter at all times.
neutral|He won't turn on us, but he's a good shot and I'd hate to do this without him.
neutral|Anyway, thanks for stopping by, partner! And keep drinking Sunset Sarsaparilla!
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|I see. So where does that put us?
neutral|You'll need someone to watch your back - Craig Boone, an NCR sniper, will be joining you. Keep your head down out there!
neutral|Yeah, that sounds alright to me. I bet we can find someone to do his work for that much. Tell him to get going.
neutral|With everyone getting to go to the surface, I'm a little jealous, but I'll be fine.
neutral|Well, you'd have to get a senior-level member of the chapter to unlock a topic for you. I've given you access to what I can, but that's not much.
neutral|But here I am, stuck in the same stale office day after day, while other people get to do the actual fighting.
neutral|Encouraged by the Courier to take her medication regularly, Lily's mind eventually attained a semblance of clarity.
neutral|You waste time, then.
neutral|Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though.
neutral|We'll have it nailed down in a terminal or two, only to have it jump to another set of terminals before we locate the third.
fear|Run! Beasts got free!
neutral|If Mr. House detects a "rogue" Securitron in his system, he remotely fries it. Getting around that security feature was a bit tricky.
surprise|If you insist. Have a nice life.
neutral|But we simply can't have anyone waving their weapons around in the hotel.  It's not the atmosphere we wish to cultivate.
neutral|I know Mr. House built it. I'm thinking it's probably some kind of weapon that he can't activate from a distance.
neutral|Whenever you're ready, dear.
neutral|
neutral|Vegas will fall.
neutral|Well, now that you mention it, a few nights back one of the townies was out scavenging for supplies.
joy|Thanks for asking. I appreciate it. I do.
sadness|Victrix causa deis placuit sed victa Catoni.
neutral|We were connected for half a minute and received enough data to fill five holodiscs. It looked like nonsense at first, but we decoded it.
neutral|I'm not exactly in Power Armor over here, so why don't you help lighten my load a bit?
neutral|Like who?
anger|A sober woman might take insult at that. Me, I might just bust you one.
neutral|The co-op is comprised of Westside locals and run by Clayton Etienne. They produce all of their own food and share in the profits of the co-op.
disgust|It's been 200 years, and they still have the mentality of scavengers. They say they're preserving these technologies, but for what?
sadness|Patrol the whole length of the Colorado for hundreds of miles? Holding this dam. It'll be the death of us.
neutral|After Rey's brain was transplanted into Rex's cybernetic body, it took Rex some time to adjust to the old scrap yard dog's memories.
neutral|They have the best equipment the NCR can get its hands on, power armor salvaged from our war with the Brotherhood.
sadness|I don't know anything that the others couldn't tell you. Caesar was one of the Followers. Before my time, of course.
neutral|He made me swear not to say a word to no one, but an NCR deserter passed through some days ago and traded for supplies.
neutral|They were one of the tribes the Three Families pushed out of Vegas! A whole bunch got killed!
neutral|They've been stopped for a while, waiting for the roads North to clear - or their clearance papers to go through.
neutral|This is Cook-cook? You sure did a number on his face. I'm not allowed to give you the full reward, but thanks for taking this guy down.
neutral|This presents a bit of a problem. Jack isn't allowed to leave Nellis, and I doubt she would make it through the artillery alive.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|They've tried to block our expansion for years, but we've managed to grow regardless. The problem is they have, too.
neutral|For supporting the NCR, the Great Khans were ruthlessly hunted down by the victorious Legion.
neutral|Didn't ask Mom to elaborate. Never heard her complain about his bedroom behavior, only complain he wasn't around to do it no more.
anger|Caesar is bad. You are bad for helping him. Please stop.
joy|Maybe I'm not as tough as I used to be, but my brains can make up for that, and my hands are still quick enough. It's time to put the guns back on.
neutral|Anything you like, sugar.
joy|Before death takes us, I would know you deeper. Come with me... My Hunter.
neutral|Those boys been living here a while now. They sell salvage and do all right. I never been with either of them.
neutral|By my calculations, his death will affect the shape of the battle for Hoover Dam minimally, if at all.
neutral|Some of Mr. House's data said that he'd lost a bunch of Securitron scouts near Hidden Valley!
neutral|Not sure if I chose it or it chose me. Dad ran a bar a long time ago, and it was a labor of love, Mom said. Didn't sound like it made her happy.
neutral|That can be arranged. You will be facing off against a couple of disobedient slaves - not much of challenge, but it might be entertaining to watch.
neutral|That's not so bad. I'll have you looking good as new. I mean, what are the chances of me botching another routine procedure in the same day?
neutral|If you're tired of a topic, I'm tired of it, too!
neutral|I want to understand how and why. See them at work.
neutral|If your answer isn't "yes, I'll bring her here" or "no, I won't, cause Gloria had me pegged wrong," then we're done here.
neutral|It's almost like I never said anything at all.
neutral|Well, don't wait too long. What I've got is something you'd need to act on, quick.
neutral|However, this is a once-only affair. Screw me once, shame on you, and all that jazz.
neutral|Why should we support the NCR? Their continual operational incompetence gets their soldiers killed, and they hold a monopoly on water in the mojave.
neutral|Don't go getting yourself shot.
surprise|Holy God, what battlefield did you just crawl off of? I'm going to be honest, this is kind of out of my league, but I'll do what I can.
neutral|It turns out there are two ways we can win this thing! Hear that? We have options!
neutral|They've got troops all over the Mojave, but it's a big desert so it's pretty easy to avoid them if you want.
neutral|Though the Courier herself was just and forthright in her dealings throughout the Wasteland, she helped the Legion achieve victory.
neutral|Yes, I handle all medical needs in the bunker. If you're ever wounded, I can treat you, for a fee.
neutral|Hill where you got shot?
neutral|So are you willing to listen?
neutral|It's time that we correct that oversight, and show this region that the Brotherhood is still a force to be reckoned with.
neutral|There you are! A few of us wanted to thank you for being such a good friend to the Brotherhood, so we've set aside some of our recycled energy cells.
surprise|Hmm. That's a valid point. I'm not really behind the NCR in all of this, but the last thing I want is panic in the streets.
joy|I need to go do something. I won't be gone long, but I'll catch up with you later. Thanks for your help with the others. It means a lot to me.
neutral|Got his name, got this pendant, and that's about it.
neutral|It sounds like Mr. House is just plain mean. No wonder the good guys want to kill him and take his stuff!
neutral|Then along comes the most peculiar-looking fellow, all decked out in a yellow radiation suit, of which he was proud all out of proportion.
neutral|Though she remained friendly with surface patrols, she was never again permitted to enter the bunker she once called home.
neutral|Oh, I'll come, but depending on the plan, I might not be staying. Keep that in mind.
neutral|A spy. Sometimes an assassin. I killed a lot of folks for the Master. Yes, Leo, you helped, too.
neutral|I try not to think too much about his personal proclivities.
neutral|Just let me know if you decide you want something.
neutral|I wonder what changed his mind.
neutral|That's two down, three to go.
neutral|No... I don't, do I? If I did, none of this would've happened.
neutral|Yeah, I did. I couldn't help him.
neutral|See you around.
neutral|This is the New Vegas branch of the Gun Runners, supplying the wasteland with only the finest armaments since 2155.
neutral|I'm guessing the other two had similar things to say. All right, consider me convinced. I'll go see Usanagi.
neutral|Fortis fortuna adiuvat. Good luck, and good bye.
neutral|We could probably take them, but we'd lose a lotta guys doing it.
neutral|That shit was my fault. I don't want to talk about it anymore, all right?
neutral|If you're curious, I'll give you access to the datastore entry on it. You'd probably be the first to read it in years, if not decades.
neutral|Plus... we killed all the witnesses.
neutral|Done.
neutral|He deals with most folks fairly, but now and then someone winds up dead with little to no evidence against them.
sadness|Hoover Dam is but a place. I will not have it be the gravestone of the Legion - whether quickly, or as you describe, slowly... by attrition.
anger|Maybe if you're Mr. House you do. I bet the people in Freeside need it a lot more than he does.
sadness|Her last words were to the Dam - and to herself. "We were going full speed ahead... but facing backwards the whole time."
neutral|Hmm?
joy|I'm here to keep everything in order. As a friend of the Legion, I can offer you some supplies while you're here.
sadness|Only thing is, there's too much going on around here for me to make a trip like that, and I need all of my guys just to keep things settled here.
neutral|When we reduced several of their members to glowing puddles of goo, their objections vanished. Since then, we've left each other alone.
neutral|They need me and I'm not going to abandon them.
sadness|Well, you got that right.
neutral|Your objective is to reach a control room halfway across the dam and install an override module similar to the one you used at the Substation.
neutral|Step into my office.
neutral|kidney damage,
fear|Run! Beasts got free!
sadness|Even if he can't use them any more? Isn't that like asking you to come up with one of your brilliant schemes after suffering a crippling head wound?
joy|Don't you worry, though, we'll sort this asshole out, rattle his cage a little.
neutral|Done.
neutral|It was decided that we would stay quiet for a time, heal the wounded, and try to come up with a new strategy.
neutral|The password you gave is valid, but old. The only way you could have gotten it is from one of our lost patrols.
fear|They wouldn't.
anger|My whole family was trapped inside. I smelled the smoke and got myself and my little sister, Rafaela, out though a window, but everyone else....
neutral|Vale.
neutral|<Makes beeping sounds>
neutral|Don't worry - I'm not that good of a player.
neutral|I never thought I'd see you again. I'm glad you're here.
neutral|That doesn't mean I don't respect Marcus for what he's trying to do. However, he doesn't truly understand the difficulties of being a Nightkin.
neutral|Lost a lot of good men to this psychopath. Morale's going to be better, now that he's gone. Here's the bounty I promised.
neutral|I would, but I tend to distract the boss lady a little too much. She can't help herself.
sadness|Without Papa Khan's guidance, I don't know what else to do. All right - you can tell the NCR the Great Khans will fight for them when Caesar attacks.
disgust|But the depths of their moral sickness, their dissolution? Nipton serves as the perfect object lesson.
fear|Gah! Petro-Chico Boy! Petro-Chico Boy is here for my chitlins! Oh. Just a dream. Just a dream....
sadness|It's never going to end. This fight with Caesar. People back home don't know what these young men and women are in for.
neutral|We're part scout, part commando, part sheriff. The training is brutal, and I'd say eight out of ten recruits washes out before the end.
neutral|Seeing how this is the only road around, I'd be a sight more surprised if we didn't run into each other from time to time.
anger|Point is, I made the caravan what it is, it's mine.
neutral|I hate to say it, but as long as the Deathclaw Mother is still alive, that pack isn't going anywhere. She'll take another mate and keep laying eggs.
neutral|My, my, this reminds me of when I was a girl. Right over there would have been where your grandpa and I had our first kiss!
neutral|And a rapid-fire G-28 grenade launching system ensures the Securitron is deadly in close-range engagements.
neutral|
neutral|Utobitha! Come, take a load off your mind!
neutral|Done.
neutral|They set upon us as we were on our way to worship one morning. We had just entered the basement.
neutral|Though some in NCR regarded Hanlon as a traitor, many believed he was the only military commander who saw the futility in defending New Vegas.
neutral|Are you sure? What kind of injuries are we talking about?
joy|I've had the honor of serving all over the NCR and now I get to be out on the front lines as the NCR comes out east to help these folks here.
neutral|When they opened, their inhabitants set out across the ruins of the Old World to build new societies, establishing villages, forming tribes.
neutral|Did you want something else?
neutral|<Gasps> For me? Do you mean it? No, it's too much! Well, okay. But it's too much! It's perfect. Thank you. Thank you.
neutral|I call her La Longue Carabine. Didn't always have the scope - I added that myself.
anger|Hope this shithead knows what he's in for. From both of us... what's his name?
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|Then he starts frying her up for kicks. Guess it was how he signed his work.
neutral|I wish you the best, outsid- Brother.
neutral|Don't fool yourself. I've dealt with enough of these gangs to know that they can't be trusted. Was there anything else?
neutral|Preferring neither the best of the NCR nor the worst of the Legion, the Courier was the man responsible for a truly independent New Vegas.
neutral|Got word back on what happened from Rangers, guess they found enough in the wreckage to identify it.
neutral|Nobody wanted to w-work with me. They said I was too green. But Betsy volunteered. Shit, you don't even know how big a d-d-deal that is.
neutral|I suppose it was only a matter of time. I wonder if, given the NCR's current situation, they would consider a truce of sorts?
neutral|You ready to fight my mongrels, then?
neutral|Maybe, depends on how my girl's feeling.
neutral|After the Vault 19 Powder Gang surrendered to the NCR, they were re-incorporated into the correctional system.
anger|Of course, if the Brotherhood should suddenly rise up to oppose my rule, you will be held responsible. Now, moving on...
neutral|Just as long as you keep making waves, that is. Be seeing you.
neutral|You gonna ask me questions all day, or are you going to let me in?
neutral|If the stories are true, he'll be a valuable commodity here at the Wrangler. I appreciate the find.
sadness|I was born just outside Mexico City. My family had a little ranch there. After they died, I took my little sister, my Rafaela, to Mexico City.
neutral|More of the same. People gambling, getting drunk, and having a good time.
neutral|We'd be the last to know.
neutral|It is my medical opinion that that could have gone better.
neutral|After all that you have done for us, I suppose you deserve to know everything...
neutral|We've talked Torres into giving you access to gear for a little cheaper, to help out with your travels. Hope it helps!
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|You must be the courier folks have been talking about. Word on the radio is that someone wronged you back in Goodsprings.
neutral|I'm heading back West if Caesar moves on the Dam.
anger|Your pranks won't work on me, smoothskin. They won't work on Jason, either.
neutral|It's a tradition in the Praetorians to specialize in unarmed combat because weapons can break or jam when needed most.
neutral|Though she'd seen the writing on the wall, the destruction of the Mojave Brotherhood came far more suddenly than Veronica had expected.
surprise|What the hell was that all about?
neutral|It, uh, didn't go so well. The Omertas were nice and said they'd give me some time to pay them back.
neutral|And the loss of HELIOS One says things are different now.
sadness|Goodbye, courier.
neutral|Not about to have Jackson bust my ass again, though, even if I came back with Caesar's head - rather be sitting here than in a cell.
surprise|Did I say us? I meant "him." Guess my eyesight isn't the only thing that's going.
neutral|You don't have to decide yet! For now, all you have to do is take this override module and install it on the terminal in the power control room!
neutral|The majority of topics fall under Ramos's aegis, since they'd constitute a security risk. Good luck getting anything out of him.
sadness|I'm fine doing research back here, even if it is a bit boring... and pointless... and a complete waste of time.
neutral|He was a missionary from Utah who hooked up with Caesar at the Grand Canyon, became his translator.
neutral|There's a twitch in my trigger finger, I've lost my eagle eyes, and the other day I could've sworn I heard Sergeant Dornan chewing me out.
neutral|We've got the biggest, baddest fort in the wasteland. There's water and power, and if we need grub, we just go out and steal it.
neutral|You thought I wouldn't notice?
neutral|I don't mind, to be honest. Living long is a real accomplishment these days. Remains to be seen if I end up dying peaceful in my bed.
neutral|Those guys are fine. They don't need me looking over their shoulders.
neutral|Dermot knows how to work salvage than any man I ever met. Doesn't go asking questions all day, neither.
neutral|Upon the military's return, debate raged within NCR's senate about who was to blame for the loss of Hoover Dam.
neutral|Hell, it's hard to believe Vegas is right outside. So, yeah, I'm looking to leave whenever you're ready.
fear|I have to commend you on your sense of historical propriety, but have you given more than a passing thought to how we would escape?
anger|And when that's done, he'll try to destroy the NCR senate and install himself as its new military dictator.
neutral|The Kings, defiant to the end, were destroyed to the last man by House's Securitrons.
joy|That means no NCR, no Mr. House, and no Legion.
surprise|Fine. Would you mind explaining why you killed Anderson?
neutral|I could work on your punching with you, if you like. Show you how to counter like a Scribe.
neutral|Something's going to have to change, or the empty suits are gonna be all that's left of us.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Sure thing. What'd you have in mind?
neutral|As a result, the system is failing, albeit slowly. I'm told we have scant few months before it shuts down completely.
neutral|I'm afraid that's not a possibility at the moment. Let's just say that your eventual safe departure from here relies on how forthcoming you are.
neutral|My husband and I are Primm long-timers. He fancies himself a trader, and I know my way around a kitchen.
neutral|500 caps was the amount requested.
neutral|Mr. House afforded him every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38, out of gratitude - and a quiet sense of pride for his choice in lieutenants.
neutral|Arcade was proud to have been one of the defenders who helped repel the Legion from Hoover Dam.
neutral|Ooh, how insightful! So then how do you think this misunderstanding came about?
neutral|Freedom? I don't know where we'll get a new start, but any place is better than rotting with the legion or Frank.
neutral|While I respect their business acumen, I'm obligated to try to destroy them however I can. That's business, after all.
sadness|If the Khans are to be immortal, we must make our own destiny. We won't fight for Caesar, but when he strikes, we will ride out one last time.
neutral|Just think of it. A new life...
neutral|In what currency would you like your payout? Non-caps currencies will have fractions paid out in caps.
neutral|You heard her, Utobitha! Beware the battle cattle, but don't *fear* the battle cattle. More after this!
sadness|Suiting up to fight against Caesar with the Navarro veterans seems like... I don't know, like a kid playing dress up in his father's clothes.
anger|That's what I love about you, boss; the pity you show for the less fortunate than you.
neutral|<happy bark!>
neutral|So if he wants to see you... well, that's a rare thing I wouldn't turn down. I'd ask him some hard questions if I were you.
neutral|Fine by me! We've got more important things to take care of!
neutral|But I know it makes sense somehow if you're the one doing it! The problem is me!
neutral|Which is why I'm sending you. Any other questions?
neutral|But this was a while ago. I knew he was sleazy, but I didn't realize he was so cold-blooded.
fear|Or maybe Robert House uploaded his brain pattern into a computer and rules to this day, a godless, soulless machine-god!
neutral|Excuse me, but I'd rather not speak of this.
neutral|<aroo!>
neutral|Towns like Goodsprings and Primm don't stay independent for long, not if you've got something the NCR wants. Still, the NCR keeps the Legion away.
neutral|With no organized opposition, their patrols began monitoring trade along I-15 and 95, seizing any items of technology they deemed inappropriate.
neutral|Like I said, I'm not from Goodsprings. I'm a trader with the Crimson Caravan Company.
neutral|
neutral|Supporting the ideals of independence, the Courier was recognized as the woman responsible for a truly free New Vegas.
neutral|Sure.
neutral|Most Nightkin at Jacobstown followed their leader Keene out into the wasteland, terrorizing the Mojave for years to come.
neutral|I do have his spare key, but I'm not sure he'd like it if I let you in there. Saint James can be a little crazy sometimes.
neutral|We'll leave a few of them in that footlocker in the corner every so often. The Paladins scoff at using recycled ammo, so no one should mind.
neutral|Oof.
neutral|Take all the time you need!
neutral|Makes sense to me! And the silly humans think we don't care. For shame. Stick around, Utobitha, for more after this!
neutral|I'm not one for running a business. Never really had a head for numbers or smooth-talk. My talents are a little more... direct.
neutral|It's your ass. Don't say you weren't warned.
neutral|I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Could you repeat it?
sadness|"For?" No, not exactly. It was a long time ago. Things are a lot different these days, and those days are way behind me.
neutral|Don't have any objections speaking with him, though if he's with the Van Graffs, he should know I'm not looking to buy weapons.
surprise|You... you all right? You took a little spill there, one moment you're smiling, then...
neutral|Give your report to the Elder, then have the doc look your over. Oh, and welcome back.
neutral|We'll see about that.
neutral|Which by my reckoning is making up for a deficiency of his. But no matter what the state of his pecker, he's sure giving the West a good fucking.
neutral|No. We don't expect him back until tomorrow.
neutral|If he could have made the Brotherhood act like machines, ordering them around with a push of a button, he would have.
neutral|Of course! Ask away!
neutral|When we found HELIOS One, he was like a kid in a candy store. He kept talking about the potential, and a "grand design, never realized."
neutral|Please don't hurt us no more. I'm begging you.
neutral|Like what?
disgust|A drink wouldn't make you any prettier, slick.
joy|Glad I left the Outpost behind.
joy|Raul Alfonso Tejada, former gunslinger and sole survivor of Hidalgo Ranch, at your service.
neutral|Mr. House afforded him every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38, partly out of gratitude, and party out of fear.
neutral|Still got them. 500 caps and they're yours.
neutral|Don't know much about it to tell the truth.
neutral|Nah, I'm gonna be busy.
neutral|Huh. Figured it'd have more buttons and dials and stuff, you know? Oh, well. It's still the electronic equivalent of a disease from Gomorrah.
neutral|Tell you what - you square off with four of my best dogs. No armor and no weapons except a machete. You survive and I let you have the bear.
neutral|Thanks to you, that's one less pack of slavers for people to worry about.
neutral|This way is better for me and for them.
neutral|There was some corporate espionage going on between Poseidon Energy's Project SEMELE and whatever was going on here.
sadness|Yeah, I suppose you're right. Guys like us can't compete any more.
neutral|But for New Vegas it seemed like this was the best chance at stability. I don't regret it.
neutral|Place looks like how my bladder feels.
neutral|Where's the mine from here?
neutral|Man, everybody. That girl didn't have one friend in this whole town. She didn't want any.
anger|Take care of the Brotherhood. Maybe then we can have a conversation.
neutral|Bad guys won't see us coming.
neutral|I got my start at the Gomorrah, good money, but I saw how those Omertas hook girls on free Jet or Med-X - then start charging.
neutral|If I become Elder, the lockdown will be lifted, and we'll once again be able to send patrols out into the wastes. We'll become powerful again.
disgust|That's your excuse?
neutral|Still, if you got a gun, guts, and feeling like going on patrol, might be some of the soldiers around here have work for you.
neutral|Oh boy.
sadness|Look for the Brotherhood's bunker around, uh... Hidden Valley. My scouts... saw some things.
joy|Water's scarce, but between things like this and Lake Mead, ain't too bad in the West as in other places.
neutral|Our arrogance would still have been our downfall.
sadness|Okay, I hear you. Forget I said anything. Consider it dropped.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|Yeah, sounds cool.
joy|Greetings, General Oliver. The disappointment you are about to experience delights me.
neutral|This'll take some work, but I'm sure I can convince them you were off your rocker in the past and you've changed your ways.
neutral|After a long and fantastic journey, ED-E finally met its end with the dangers of the Mojave.
neutral|Did four tours against the Brotherhood, too. She used to be ranger until an injury took her out of action. Happens to a lot of us, unfortunately.
neutral|I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse. We are much more liberal about the sharing of technology than those Brotherhood... People.
neutral|What? That's great. I'll have to check it out when I head back tonight.
neutral|Apparently somebody did them ill, all the way inside the surface-city with lights - the Strip, and Freeside, they call it.
neutral|What can be said? He's a man of towering intellect, the founder of the Legion, conquerer of 86 tribes.
neutral|You're starting to get quite the reputation around here, aren't you? Don't get me wrong, I'm not passing judgement or anything.
neutral|Brothers, help!
neutral|<growl>
neutral|Armed with a wide array of improvised explosives and stolen weapons, the Vault 19 Powder Gang tormented the Mojave Wasteland for years.
anger|Might as well be shooting blanks!
anger|Lot of PreWar factories and tech lying around the Mojave, our engineers'll get it running again, no matter how much damage you've done down there.
surprise|Perhaps NCR has the strength of a cornered animal... it will not be enough to hold this place.
neutral|And you assisted them? That's what you mean to say, isn't it?
surprise|You're not kidding. You're in bad shape, friend. I'd be happy to fix you up... for a reasonable fee.
neutral|A crude question, crudely asked.
neutral|Yet in its wake, she took small comfort in her decision to remain by their side through their few remaining days.
neutral|
neutral|Hmm, indulgent, what rhymes with indulgent? Efful- no, no, that's terrible.
neutral|Those two? Represents unification. Mostly good for shade. Won't do much else when the Legion reaches us.
neutral|The news devastated her. Despite her best efforts to leave her past behind, she found herself compelled to make one final journey to Hidden Valley.
sadness|Kind of you to say, but there are better people than me around here. I just hope the Followers can make a difference in the long run.
neutral|Like I'd hang around to find out!
surprise|You have to understand that Kimball is a symbol. Without him, there would be no NCR occupation of the Mojave.
neutral|The kids love us, but the old-timers tend to shy away and keep to themselves. They probably couldn't pull off the look, anyway.
sadness|There are plenty of ways to die out here, and most of them, surprisingly, don't have anything to do with war. Just common human fragility.
neutral|Warning. Retargeting sequence initiated for HELIOS One reflector banks.
neutral|Well, this ain't New Vegas, but I reckon you can find what you need here. Try the office out front.
anger|I should have you torn apart for speaking like that - but maybe you're right. The glory of the past is an empty dream.
neutral|No, don't bother. A person as well-traveled as yourself is bound to pick up all kinds of skills, I suppose. Luckily, that's not all I have for you.
neutral|What do you have to say for yourself?
neutral|No. I gotta go.
neutral|
neutral|There's not much funding for medical research with OSI or any other group - not unless it has a military application, anyway.
neutral|In what currency would you like your payout? Non-caps currencies will have fractions paid out in caps.
neutral|Mags and her soldiers were posthumously recognized for their valor by NCR.
neutral|Alice McLafferty, eh? No, I see the zeroes... and I know she's good for them.
neutral|Yes, that's the stuff. And the container's shielding must be intact, or you'd be dead by now.
neutral|I have reserved a small part of my supplies for sale. The profits go directly to the purchase of additional supplies to help the less fortunate.
neutral|Yes, I heard. I believe we're now responsible for paying off his gambling debts, but that you bargained him down from a more outrageous demand.
neutral|Legionaries?! We have a problem!
neutral|Buried beneath tons of rubble, the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel was no more.
neutral|See ya round, buckaroo.
neutral|Good as new.
surprise|Who the hell was that?
neutral|Very good! I'm happy to say you've proven you're definitely an NCR citizen, which means you qualify for our program.
neutral|His friends seemed disappointed about it. Heck, I would be, too, if I found such a fine store and left my money elsewhere.
neutral|If you believe in the Legion's cause, your mission is a reward in and of itself. Good luck.
neutral|Due to his slow speed, some crooks get away without a scratch, but Primm continues to prosper under his watchful robotic eye.
neutral|Thanks for the help. We'll find our own way out.
joy|I need to go take care of something before I set up at Freeside. I'll see you soon. And again, thanks for your help with the others.
anger|Try to do better with your next assignment...
neutral|The kids wish we were shelling a real target, but Pearl thinks it wise to not start up a war just as the lady has risen.
neutral|Which is why all super mutants should do what you say, right?
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|Well, that's just mean! I don't like Mr. House one bit! No wonder the good guys want to kill him and take his stuff!
neutral|Well, except you, that is.
neutral|Then I guess there's no need for us to keep talking, honey. Sorry.
neutral|You may have noticed the Bark Scorpions up above. Though tiny, their venom packs quite a punch. Treating scorpion stings is my most common procedure.
neutral|Oh, and a friendly word of advice: if you happen to "stumble across" any weapons during your stay here, well... just don't wear them openly. You dig?
neutral|Still, I'm not convinced Moreno hates the NCR as much as he thinks he does. You still might be able to talk him out of leaving.
surprise|Jesus, I don't think that's supposed to just dangle like that. And what the hell is that thing there?
surprise|Uh... I'm afraid Ambassador Crocker is no longer here. You might want to talk to the receptionist for more information.
neutral|Mojave Outpost sent word through the stations. The rangers coming up from Baja moved through Dayglow a week ago.
neutral|No! ...Don't disable... cerebral... I'd rather be... killed... just kill... me...
neutral|You, over there! Go back where you came from, thieves! Don't try our patience!
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|Special ammo includes things like armor-piercing bullets which don't hurt the target as much but let you punch through armor easier.
neutral|That doesn't matter in the slightest. You are an accessory to treason simply by association.
neutral|Legate Lanius will take Caesar's place at the head of the Legion. The Legate is a fine warrior, and the Legion will do well under his command.
neutral|So let's do this. When you're ready, I'll go in and give you a little intro. Then I leave the room and you make him regret the day he was born.
neutral|We'll continue our own efforts in the meantime.
neutral|I'm assuming you're referring to mental trauma. I'll make time in my schedule.
joy|We owe you our freedom, outlander. Please, if there's anything we can do for you...
neutral|All right.
neutral|I'm sure it's been hit - what I need to know is if they survived it. Might be Powder Gangers with all that smoke in the air.
neutral|I knew she was carrying the Platinum Chip! And I knew right where Benny should wait for her!
neutral|You can get to the Gourmand from the lobby here - it's a big set of double doors on the first floor on the eastern side. Can't miss it.
neutral|Attention. ARCHIMEDES I Laser is now armed. Move all personnel to minimum safe distance before initiating test fire.
sadness|A lot of different places. I only know what I was told. Some of them were cut down by the NCR and the Brotherhood. Some of them went east.
neutral|Well, the wildlife for one thing. Rowdy locals for another.
neutral|I don't know, seems to be a lot of attention on Nipton. Word is, one of the snipers in the nest on the roof spotted smoke from the East.
anger|A gigantic robot to stomp us all to death, who cares? Whatever it is, House built it, so I want it destroyed.
disgust|"Just a name?" You obviously don't know me at all to sweet talk me like that.
neutral|NCR is not in the habit of buying and selling towns... unless that was some sort of joke on your part.
neutral|Gossip is one thing, dirt on the Family is something else totally.
neutral|Shit. Is he serious? The 25% increase in weapons is doable, but a 50% increase in ammunition is nuts.
neutral|That's fair. But there's been that voice inside me saying the same thing, and whiskey wasn't killing it.
neutral|She keeps tabs on caravan traffic in the Mojave, wouldn't put it past her to keep track of Cassidy Caravans and its owner.
neutral|Another one coming. You're on.
fear|I've always known when to fight and when to back down, and it seems to me I ought to back down this time.
neutral|Once I get my caps from Dhatri, I'm going to head on over to Gomorrah and win big at cards.
neutral|The Dam will fall, and the rest of the Profligate west will soon follow.
neutral|I've heard here and there that the word "Hope" has recently become quite popular with the Squatters.
neutral|See that you do. I'd advise you to avoid the prison over there. It's overrun by barbarians and the whole place may become a battlefield at any time.
neutral|Under the Legion's banner, civilization - savage as it was - finally came to the Mojave wasteland.
neutral|Chief Hanlon personally directed the evacuation of the rangers to Mojave Outpost as they fell back into NCR territory.
neutral|We'll be able to use the schematics you acquired to begin manufacturing our own weapons immediately. We'll provide some to you at a discount.
neutral|Our story begins, as most stories do, with the Master. Our glorious leader had created the Super Mutants, but something nagged at him.
neutral|Well of course there is, dearie. How else could I hear him tell me who to chop?
neutral|Let's get on with it, shall we? Hmm?
neutral|Mayor Steyn got what was coming to him, looks like.
neutral|I wonder if Marcus knows about this place....
neutral|After the NCR's victory at the dam, the Followers of the Apocalypse were pushed out of Old Mormon Fort during its occupation by NCR forces.
neutral|Yes, the others in the squad said you'd come to them about her. It's a start, but let's hope she sticks with her treatment as long as it's necessary.
neutral|Where else?
anger|Get a clue. We have caravans. We deal in bulk.
neutral|Ten years ago, Chief Elise met with representatives of the Desert Rangers to discuss terms of what would become the Ranger Unification Treaty.
neutral|Huh - didn't know there were women Powder Gangers. Oh, well - the NCR will still give me a nice bounty for your corpse.
neutral|I can promise that, what happens after... not even God himself could move the Congress in or out of session. And this... this is a tricky matter.
neutral|Sorry, friend, but I just can't do it.
neutral|That's one down, four to go.
disgust|Full up here, but just enough so we can't send out patrols. Got to maintain a "standing force," Jackson's orders... NCR's orders.
neutral|So I'll give you one more chance to tell me what you were doing.
neutral|You mean... just let them go? How would I explain this to my superiors?
neutral|You already took care of Mr. House? Wow, you work fast!
neutral|Many of the senior paladins, myself included, advised him to fight a retreating action, but he refused to budge. Said he almost "had it working".
neutral|Well, if you didn't see anyone, they might be gone - be just like Powder Gangers to hit and run.
neutral|No, I'm done talking.
neutral|This was a minor refueling station for vertibirds. It seemed an appropriate place to stash our equipment if we ever needed.
anger|No, I think it is the same for me. Maybe for a different reason, but... you can't hold on to a past you've never had.
neutral|I'm surprised this place hasn't fallen apart. When I put it into standby mode, I expected to return to it within a few years, not decades.
neutral|I'm not quite sure the kind of greeting NCR troopers will give an escaped con like myself. Figure it's better to stay put for now.
neutral|They fire artillery on anyone who comes near their settlement at Nellis Air Force Base. Talk about rude!
neutral|I might have some answers for you. What did you want to know?
neutral|My girl is trapped by geckos on the ridge and I can't get to her. Please, she's going to die!
neutral|Oooh, what can you tell us about them?
neutral|That is somewhat reassuring, but we still don't have the resources to care for the entire Mojave by ourselves.
neutral|This again? You gonna help me out with what I need, or not?
neutral|I'd like to believe you, but I can't take the risk under current circumstances.
neutral|It's standard procedure when a chapter relocates to an area, but standard procedure wasn't our last Elder's style, either.
joy|I can keep your gear in good working order, too. If you notice your stuff takes a lot longer to break, well, you can thank me with a sarsaparilla.
anger|Chop them harder, Leo! Harder! Don't blame the weapon!
neutral|I can pay you, but it ain't much for what you pulled off. I'll get on the ham radio first thing and tell people all about you, though.
anger|Yes, strange as it sounds, I figured that bad mouthing one of the Strip's most powerful people wasn't a good idea.
neutral|Meet me outside, behind the saloon.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
anger|Reloading! Wait, no, I'm out!
neutral|The rangers assisted the troopers admirably during the Legion's ill-fated attack.
neutral|We'd be the last to know.
neutral|But that's neither here nor there, I'm afraid. Marjorie won't have it, as long as she fails to see the wisdom of my perspective.
neutral|Then I'd have to help you! I mean, it seems pretty obvious Benny wouldn't want me to, but hey, not my fault I can't say no!
neutral|The New California Republic celebrated its second victory at Hoover Dam, establishing definitive control over the entire Mojave Wasteland.
anger|What the hell are you on about? House? He's just a rumor on the Strip, never leaves his...
neutral|I'm the one asking the questions right now, and you still haven't answered me. I suggest you start doing so.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|A courier dropped it off a little bit ago. I'd hoped to get it up and running for some courier work, but never could get it running.
neutral|Excellent! The Followers' mission will be better served with someone like yourself traveling around the Mojave.
neutral|Well, well, well. Driver Nephi. Nothing to say, you son of a bitch? No tips on my golf swing?
disgust|Don't think because I'm a Ghoul, I'm stupid. You're fine.
neutral|Or cute, loveable centaurs, who fight and die for us and ask nothing in return? After much deliberation, I went with the centaurs.
joy|You liked it? Wow, you're the first one who ever did!
neutral|Don't tell him I told you this, but when those scorpions surrounded us, I'd bet a week's rations he pissed himself!
neutral|Today, with the delivery of the Platinum Chip, all that changes. Behold, for the first time, Securitrons running the Mark II OS!
neutral|There've been complaints about the amount of water we're supplying, but those are just excuses for lack of diligence, I'm sure.
anger|Anyway, it was supposed to be safe, but some raiders happened to pass through where she was scavenging. I won't speak of what they did to her.
neutral|Done.
neutral|If you wish.
neutral|Hey, do what you want. I'm just trying to make it easier on you.
surprise|We did take the towers easier than expected. I cannot believe even the Republic would overlook such an opening in their defenses.
neutral|Prior to the lockdown, we had extensively scouted the surrounding area, and compiled dossiers on nearby points of interest.
sadness|Sitting on the shore of Lake Mead, looking east. Listening to a radio. Trying to not get too many people killed.
neutral|Most of the limestone comes from Quarry Junction out west. The supply had stopped for awhile because of a Deathclaw problem.
joy|I like the servile attitude. Keep it up.
neutral|That elevator is nowhere, baby. Step over to the mic.
neutral|I'm intrigued, so I'll go to this reunion. I'll be handing things over to Calamity, so talk to her if anything comes up.
sadness|Meeting Corporal Sterling, well... it kind of got me thinking.
neutral|Rangers, this is the chief. I know I can ramble on sometimes, but I need you to listen close for the next minute or so. I've got some bad news.
neutral|A vast army of slaves forged from the conquest of 86 tribes - Caesar's Legion.
neutral|So don't ask me about it again, you hear me?
neutral|Very well, but be brief.
neutral|Now go, and teach them what you learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
neutral|Acceptance into Utobitha pending Best Friend Tabitha's approval.
neutral|Despite surviving the destruction of the oil rig and the loss of their comrades at Navarro, the venerable Remnants were no match for the Courier.
neutral|Speak to me when you are ready and I'll have your weapons returned.
neutral|Are you talking about that damn bright light we've seen blast off to the south occasionally? I was wondering what the hell that was.
neutral|No one in town knows that I know what happened to my wife. Best they never know. Or the Legion will be after me next.
neutral|I said, sure as lack of rain, you were still kicking. Then he turned down the job, just like that. I asked if he was sure, it was good money.
neutral|I prefer Mr. House, of course, but he may not be around forever. And the NCR will surely set back our cuisine. Tell your Mr. Caesar we are with him.
neutral|And assuming they managed to breach the bunker, I would be forced to activate our failsafe system.
neutral|If you take trying to keep me as far away from Hidden Valley as possible because I ask too many difficult questions as a sign of respect, oh yeah.
anger|The Great Khans aren't exactly clamoring to fight for my Legion now.
neutral|Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Keep talking like that and your ass is going to be in the gutter. 25%. Take it or leave it.
anger|So tell me, did you really think I'd be stupid enough to fall for this again? One of my men saw you go in and out of the Kings' place.
neutral|Reinforcements? About time we got some more hands around here.
neutral|Nolan, we'll resume this discussion later. I can see you have company.
anger|Weapon's done for.
neutral|
neutral|I'm glad that you understand. After you.
neutral|Well, let me know when it is.
neutral|Of course, Jimmy.
disgust|Yeah, he's been with NCR so long all he can see is the worst outcome of everything - so he doesn't do anything.
neutral|Records indicate man requested free lodging and was directed to concrete building in Freeside. Transmitting coordinates.
fear|Don't be shooting wild in here - might set something off.
neutral|I'm sure you have your reasons, but we are much too busy to waste our time on those selfish bastards.
neutral|The radiation around the launch pad alone would kill Chris in minutes. The radioactivity of the Far Beyond is much stronger.
joy|Hmm... this is exactly the kind of symbol the Khans could unite behind.
neutral|You've become someone I can count on, so I believe I can share something rather confidential with you.
neutral|Because it's his name. He may be high-strung, but he's all right. Hauls his half of scrap, which is all I need.
neutral|The rapist with the flamethrower? Yeah, that's a combination I stay the fuck away from.
neutral|Not so eager to take on a suicide mission, is that it? If you'd shown moderation in your dealings with the NCR, we wouldn't be in this position.
neutral|That's a good dog. Well, I'm out of here. Later, Simon.
neutral|Maybe it's time you start looking forward.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|If you spent the first half of your life flying Enclave troopers in a vertibird, I suppose picking over Pre-War rocket parts doesn't quite compare.
anger|You there! Stop!
fear|Holy shit! Run for your lives!
neutral|There've been a lot of people moving into the area lately, and it's got some people riled. Can't blame 'em myself. There's only so much to go around.
neutral|Yes, of course. But refraining from those "dietary practices" is a primary requirement of their contract.
disgust|Have a nice life.
neutral|Yes, yes.
neutral|Hush, Leo, it's medicine time now!
anger|Don't matter much how we settle this, as long as it gets settled.
anger|What, loot we'd get anyway once we kicked your ass and more? No, I don't think so.
joy|That's funny. Mr. House doesn't want to keep New Vegas independent. He just wants to keep the NCR and Caesar's Legion from pushing him around.
neutral|It's tough on both sides of the fence, really. I think women have it worse. They're like money, given as rewards. Breeding stock.
sadness|Anyway, that was weighing on my mind. Thanks for letting me get it out in the open, boss.
neutral|I stuck around, figuring the NCR would show up and put things back the way they were. No sense in making myself look guilty, right?
neutral|There aren't any more implants I can give you - you've already bought everything I had available.
neutral|Military operations are classified information.
neutral|Sorry, but I can't risk exposing the tribe to more savage outsiders.
neutral|You may have questionable methods, outsider, but some of us realize you get the job done.
neutral|If you want, hold onto Rex for a little while longer. I'm sure he'd enjoy that. Was there anything else you wanted?
neutral|NoVac's the hotel, not the lizard.
neutral|I was thinking of taking a walk a little later.
surprise|And what do you propose?
neutral|I'm surprised you're not wearing that hood to hide your hair like you usually do, Veronica.
disgust|I guess that means you don't have to apologize to all of the people in Westside you just screwed over.
neutral|Old but spry, honey. So long as my back don't give out, I can make a living lying on it.
joy|That hit the spot.
joy|The Khans, though, are protected by Caesar's emissary - I have Karl's word we will remain our own tribe as long as we remain loyal to Caesar.
neutral|Of course, dynamite works pretty good against caravan guards, too. So, that's what we do - rob and blow things up.
anger|My Legion can win a fight against the Brotherhood of Steel, but it would be costly. Your job is to make sure there's no Brotherhood for us to fight.
neutral|I can't give you any more right now. Come back in a day.
neutral|Hey, doesn't matter to me. I was just curious.
neutral|Today, you are the waves of the Pacific, pushing ever eastward. You are the sequoias rising from the Sierra Nevadas, defiant and enduring.
sadness|That's a grim deal to make. But when it came down to it, it's the same choice he made. Not all sacrifices are made by the willing.
neutral|In what currency would you like your payout? Non-caps currencies will have fractions paid out in caps.
neutral|Sorry, they don't tell me their plans and I don't want to know. I'm just happy they don't make me fuck anybody anymore.
neutral|Second, even though the whole scheme was Anderson's idea, it's the only way the co-op could stay in business. The water means everything.
joy|It fills me with hope to see that people from the surface world are kind, and brave. Again, thank you.
neutral|During the retreat of Caesar's Legion from the Mojave Wasteland, Arcade was a sad casualty, one of many.
neutral|Chaos became uncertainty, then acceptance, with minimal loss of life. New Vegas assumed its position as an independent power in the Mojave.
neutral|I guess I always thought maybe I'd be the one to do it, but I just... never got my nerve up.
neutral|Okay, here we go again. Who was the most popular president in NCR history, Kimball, Tibbett, Tandi, or Peterson?
anger|Hey, I was just asking. No need to get uppity about it. I'll be at the reunion, don't you worry.
neutral|There, with only two bullets loaded, Boone did the only thing he believed would put an end to his suffering.
neutral|The NCR gives its citizens a shot at something more. We have laws, currency, health care, government. All the things that were lost.
neutral|Who you are comes from the choices you make when life gets tough.
sadness|All right... maybe I was a little harsh. I can be that way.
neutral|Hope he didn't see any trouble in that package of yours. Maybe he thought your name was bad luck. Not for me to say.
neutral|I've done a bit of everything around here - courier, butcher, crier, escort, gun for hire...
neutral|Good to hear, buddy. So is the boss lady in?
neutral|I got more where that came from. Want another?
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
anger|First the Legion, then the Brotherhood hitting us is about the last thing the Republic needs right now.
neutral|Doctor Henry calls them "anti-psychotics." I don't know what they're supposed to do, they just make my memory fuzzy.
neutral|After you've resolved the situation with the President, there's one more thing for you to take care of!
neutral|Please don't hurt us no more. I'm begging you.
neutral|However, all that hard work on my part means that the price has gone up. 100 a tip, now. You game?
neutral|He did. For years, he fought with the Council. Taught me to question our direction. Meanwhile he'd become more out-of-touch than all of them.
neutral|The Legion will decide that, Profligate, not you. Will you go before my Decanus for judgement, or be killed where you stand?
neutral|My guess is that it has something to do with the fact that every mutant in the State of Utobitha  has been give explicit orders regarding security.
neutral|A couple of years ago they tried to take over Hoover Dam, but the NCR beat them back. The NCR didn't - or couldn't - finish the job, though.
neutral|The d-doc has a c-clinic north of here. Can't m-m-miss it. You should t-talk to Bitter-Root, too. He's b-been to see the doc, too.
neutral|Even if we wanted to, we don't have the resources to handle such a monumental task right now.
neutral|See that you do.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|The only Van Graffs I know are the ones out West - well, except for Gloria Van Graff, and I don't know her all that well, nor do I want to.
neutral|Many locals moved on, fearful of Caesar's long shadow. Only the old and the stubborn remained.
surprise|Et tu, mi amice?
neutral|No! Please don't! Everyone would blame me! Look, I'll do whatever you want, just name it!
neutral|Maybe, depends on how my girl's feeling.
neutral|No one gets shakes like that unless they're eating human flesh, but no one would believe me. The sick bastard gradually went insane and passed away.
neutral|But we got our wonderful snipers keeping an eye in that direction, and so far the slavers have left us alone.
neutral|Three days.
neutral|In the end, the surviving mutants abandoned Jacobstown entirely, its existence quickly forgotten by the rest of the wasteland.
neutral|You're doing great! Keep on spending money, hopefully we'll get some extra action in here.
neutral|Good. Had him figured for NCR, one of the rangers maybe. Anyway, speaking of the NCR, I need you to take a walk down to Primm.
neutral|But... you don't have a "this is good news" expression on your face.
neutral|Everybody's backed up here. You think it'd be good for business, but most of the traders are tight with the caps, even the larger caravan outfits.
fear|It can't be! How the hell...
neutral|Never been there since the NCR's got troops all over it. Must be pretty important.
neutral|The medicine is supposed to help with that, but sometimes grandma doesn't take it.
neutral|Anything else I can help you with?
neutral|Are you willing to listen to what I have to say?
neutral|You think that did it? Maybe we should test the rangefinder outside.
neutral|You want to build something, talk to me, and we can do it right there on the spot. Workbenches are for novices.
neutral|Now that we got that little business out of the way, what can I do to make your Tops experience the tops?
neutral|Good. Make sure they help the Legion when the time comes. As for your next assignment...
neutral|Careful with Contreras, though. He's not above suspicion himself.
neutral|It is because of men and women like Private First Class Jeremy Watson that Nevada and the New California Republic remain free and secure.
anger|Firing dry here.
neutral|Something feels funny about him, and I want you to deal with him. Shake him down if he's legit, but if he's not, take him out.
anger|Don't have it. Benny stole it, right before he stabbed us in the back. He's probably back at the Strip by now, laughing at me.
neutral|I'll send some guys to check out your story, but that's some good news for a change.
joy|Good. I'm sure you were thorough. Here's your payment for a job well done.
neutral|Hey... Look! Someone's coming out of the 38!
anger|Check's in the mail, hey? Don't get my hopes up.
neutral|Walking the Mojave with you can't be any worse than here, that's for sure. All right, I'm in.
neutral|That'll have to do. God, what a mess. People turning against each other when the Mojave's at risk of falling?
neutral|Some of the caravan might be ash, but we were expecting raiders and over-inquisitive NCR border guards. There might be something left.
anger|Right now, they're all that's standing here - well, except for the corpses. So that's your plan, hold the Dam here all by your lonesome?
disgust|Pulling bullets out of a vengeance-crazed drifter is truly a noble step up from tending to the downtrodden of Freeside, but I think I'll pass.
anger|Figured as much. Come on, you sons of bitches, we're ready.
anger|He's a convict. Just without the chains. Said his name was Cobb. "Powder Gangers" is what they call themselves. Plenty more like him out there.
neutral|The peace with NCR served to ease Veronica's worries about the Brotherhood's immediate future.
neutral|Done.
surprise|You visit the Tops, and next thing you know, the head of the Chairmen is fleeing the Strip like a whimpering little pup?
neutral|After the Legion's victory, Caesar, out of a strange respect for his old fellows, allowed the Followers safe passage out of the wasteland.
neutral|He had heard I was interested in Mr. House's technology so he hit me up... so to speak.
neutral|The Fiends overran Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|Round about one in the morning, I spied some lights in the control tower. Now that's the third time I've spied those lights, mind you.
surprise|Very optimistic of you. You'll make a good Follower someday assuming Caesar doesn't have us both crucified.
neutral|Stay safe.
neutral|A pittance, sugar - and I'll leave you without a care in the world.
neutral|Yee-haw! Ain't that pretty?
neutral|Okay, but this is the last story I can tell without a bigger risk to my rep.
neutral|<Static>
neutral|Wish they got here a bit earlier, but that's the senate for you.
neutral|What'll fight on Blue?
neutral|I thought you'd gone up the flume, but that Doc Mitchell knows his trade. It's good to see you up and around, right as a trivet!
neutral|We'd try to bribe our way out, but seeing as how Benny didn't pay us yet, that won't happen.
neutral|I was an NCR medic for six months, so I'm not exactly a "doctor." Still, it's more medical training that any of the other guys here.
neutral|I could use some Stimpaks... how 'bout some nice Bloatfly Steaks in trade?
joy|Well, assuming you survive the radiation sickness, the lynch mobs, and the possibility of going feral, one day you'll get old and decrepit, like me.
neutral|The bigger issue is payment. To supply the camp with meat with cost some serious caps.
neutral|I'm currently an Apprentice in the Brotherhood, and recently became eligible for Journeyman status.
neutral|Don't get me wrong - the NCR's got a lot of decent folk in it. It's just that they make you part of them whether you like it or not.
anger|God, what a mess. People turning against each other when the Mojave's at risk of falling?
neutral|And what would *that* be?
neutral|Can't. The King's got me busy on something.
anger|I don't know. And I don't like not knowing.
neutral|Wanna get lucky? Head on down to the Atomic Wrangler!
neutral|Nah, nah - means I poked through old buildings looking for working tech and such. Some folks just call it "salvaging," but never liked the term.
neutral|Caesar can adapt, though, and when required, he can run any mix of legionaries as skirmishers and still retain order in the ranks.
sadness|Been weeks since it was hit, so the site's probably a Cazador nest by now.
neutral|I'll be happy to satisfy your rambunctious curiosity at a more appropriate moment. But now, I'll repeat my question...
neutral|I'd like to get what I can from it and use that data for the good of humanity... ALL of humanity, unlike the Brotherhood.
neutral|We were overrun, plain and simple. My Brothers fought with great courage, but in the end the enemy was just too many.
neutral|They're talking about heading south toward Nipton, then west to Novac where they'll meet up with someone...
anger|Prefer a shot of whiskey, but...
anger|Now that that bitch is in hell, they'll have a shot at her, too. So what are we waiting for? We've got more work to do.
neutral|We'll leave it under a rock beneath the old windmill. Think of it as a... as a sign of respect.
neutral|The Followers of the Apocalypse used the information recovered from ED-E on Poseidon Energy, to develop new methods to harness the energy of the sun.
neutral|The victory here shall be swift. Our forces shall take the Dam, secure it, then build a road west on the bodies of the NCR.
neutral|That's not aiding an enemy! Not when you do it!
sadness|Searchlight was worse. One of Caesar's frumentarii must have found something in there, flooded the whole camp with radiation.
joy|You're right. You do need a doctor. Lucky I happened along. But first let's discuss my fee...
neutral|Twice. Both times, I drank a lot of liquor and lost most of my caps at the card tables. In that order, now that I think about it.
neutral|I guess it doesn't seem so far now if you look at a map, but back then, they were out a ways.
neutral|Cass lived to see Hoover Dam in its Old World glory, humming with power the likes of which the Mojave had never seen.
neutral|Mr. House would keep New Vegas stable, if not free, for generations. Mr. House afforded the Courier every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38.
neutral|Hanlon and his fallen rangers were revered for their bravery and sacrifice.
neutral|This is just a site for local Followers to pick up assignments and check in.
neutral|Heard they were having trouble bringing stuff in, or keeping up with the demand, or something, lately.
neutral|Nothing while I'm on the clock. You wanna know about us, head on over to our place. It's the one with the big sign that says "The Kings".
neutral|No. No, I can't. Because this evidence might be true... but it doesn't just implicate them.
neutral|All right. I'll monitor when it jumps. When I give the signal, start checking terminals.
neutral|Those who weren't destroyed by the Courier fled into the hills or attempted to work their way back through the Mojave Wasteland. Few survived.
neutral|Yep, I'd be better off setting up an ambush along one of their routes to catch stragglers. Thanks for the information. You may've saved my life.
neutral|I have glimpsed it only in visions, wanderer, but what I have seen is truly miraculous.
neutral|That's much better, isn't it, Leo?
neutral|He tended to the sick in Freeside for a while longer, then returned to NCR territory to become a teacher with the Followers there.
neutral|You know where to find me, honey.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Well, if you genuinely care so much, they're flight simulators. If you don't know our history yet, you should see Pete and get the tour.
neutral|I suppose there's no point in denying it any longer. I killed Corporal White to protect Westside's self-reliance. It was rash, and I regret it now.
joy|If agave and mesquite were that miraculous, the locals would have figured it out a few thousand years ago.
neutral|That'll be Eddie. You can usually find him sitting in the warden's old chair up in the main building.
anger|Woman of the West... you will learn your place - in my tent, and again, when you beg for release on the edge of my blade.
neutral|She walked a hell of a way until she crossed paths with my Dad and he convinced her to stop walking. And lucky for me, he was a horny old bastard.
neutral|Why are you doing this?
neutral|The Misfits' laziness caught up with them when the Legion attacked Camp Golf.
neutral|Somewhere along the way, something broke inside me. I couldn't find us a way out of this desert. I wrestled with it, and it took me down a dark road.
neutral|I'm not afraid of a gunfight, but I'd rather get back to Red Rock without a few extra holes in me if I can help it.
neutral|500 caps would go a long way for some soldier's families.
neutral|Why the need for a bunch of old warhorses like us?
neutral|I suppose you're right... When the Legion assaults Hoover Dam, my Securitrons will be waiting for the Omertas. They won't accomplish much.
neutral|I've heard what most people know... he's said to run New Vegas, he runs the robots, but... well, no one's really seen him.
neutral|Hi there! Come with me!
neutral|He doesn't feel pain and he never, ever shows mercy. If all Legionaries were like him, the Legion would be invincible.
neutral|I'm sorry, but you didn't get all of the questions right, which proves you're not a citizen of the NCR. Sorry.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|Supporting all of the chaos that comes with independence, the Courier was the woman responsible for a truly free New Vegas.
neutral|Here, take my report to the Elder. He must be made aware of what happened here.
neutral|I understand that Cooke was behind it all. I kept my head down the whole time. Didn't want any part of it.
neutral|I have to admire your prudent nature. Why get caught up in action, you know? And results?
neutral|This is exactly what I've been looking for! McNamara gave my men new orders without telling me, thereby breaking the Chain That Binds!
joy|But the topper, the coup de grâce? Mr. House dies - while you're visiting him at the Lucky 38.
neutral|Bzzzt... Law Enforcement Protocols reinstated, pardner. Initializing use of force authorization... authorization found. Yee-haw!
neutral|Fix it, then. You're not leaving until it's done and Caesar lives.
neutral|Though many NCR military officers fled the territory soon after the dam was lost, Chief Hanlon remained at Camp Golf to surrender to the Legion.
sadness|He became Caesar and Joshua Graham became his legate, his right hand. And that's where Graham stayed until Hoover Dam.
neutral|That's none of your business. I suggest you head back the way you came.
neutral|But I think things are starting to come together.
neutral|That's a mighty fine offer, but I'm gonna need to conserve my strength if I’m to make it all the way to New Vegas.
neutral|Don't rush it, though. Toss it around in your head a little. You only get one favor from The King.
anger|The Gun Runners detected an intruder roaming around, so they'll like be aware of the theft soon enough.
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|Understood.
neutral|They stood and hoped their turn would not come. Each cared only for himself.
surprise|Well, boss, when a giant, insane Super mutant asks you to stay put, you do what you're told. Well, maybe you don't, but I'm just a broke down old man.
neutral|I see the wisdom in that. I'll radio for a unit to head up to Primm and offer some additional support.
neutral|I'll tell you something. Good luck finding that thing. But if you do find it, don't waste your time trying to sell it to me.
neutral|But, if I'll get one more chance to fly, count me in. I'll be there. My part of the pass phrase is "Dear."
neutral|Wrong. This is exactly the right time. I'm about to prevent you from making a huge mistake.
neutral|Careful if we go off the road.
neutral|All this is, is a slave collar. Seen plenty of these infernal contraptions in my day, and I know just how to spring 'em. Hold still.
neutral|Brothers! Attack!
disgust|In case you weren't paying attention, you killed the only person who ever gave a damn about them.
neutral|Knowing Jimmy, I'm sure he took good care of them. I'm surprised he ran away!
anger|I don't trade caps or supply anyone who keeps slaves, and treats women like Brahmin in those... "camps" of theirs.
neutral|Nice puppies - do doggies want treats?
neutral|Stay safe.
neutral|One of my Frumentarii has set up camp near Hoover Dam. His name his Cato Hostilius.
joy|It was quite the scandal, at least in the Latin-American tabloid journalism market.
neutral|If we hear you crossed us, the next bounty hunter will be coming for you.
neutral|Shoot.
anger|Drinking to forget, and it's only getting me mad instead. Whiskey always gets my temper up - now more than ever.
neutral|I've also got two much more expensive implants. One's a sub-dermal implant that will make you more resistant to damage.
neutral|Of course.
neutral|Can't help you, then. Medical supplies aren't cheap, you know.
anger|What's the point of surviving the war? Why did the founders of the Followers crawl their way out of vaults to bring knowledge back to the wasteland?
neutral|Morale looks low.
neutral|I just like 'em, you know? They make you feel like a woman. Those ladies before the War, they knew what they were doing.
neutral|That is unfortunate. If you change your mind, please see me right away.
neutral|Be careful out there! It won't be long before the Legion makes its move!
disgust|But he did so by election. What better way to stunt the growth of leaders, not to mention whole cultures?
neutral|Troike spends all his days down in Zoara on the lower level.
neutral|All right, give a yell if there's trouble.
sadness|As the Legion marched West, she found it difficult to see the Dam as anything more than a gravestone for the Mojave - and everyone in it.
neutral|Return to the penthouse now. We have much to discuss...
neutral|I don't have time to discuss all the different aspects of the NCR with you, but if you want it all in a nutshell - the NCR is progress.
anger|And we shall harvest as we move West. We only need move forward.
neutral|You've done right by us, so I suppose I could spare some supplies.
joy|Just don't try to help the Legion, and we shouldn't have any problems. Sound good?
neutral|I'm sure you'll do just fine without old Vic slowing you down.
neutral|This weapon's done for.
neutral|They're the NCR's finest. A one-man platoon, each of 'em.
neutral|You may have questionable methods, outsider, but some of us realize you get the job done.
disgust|Talk to me at my shack, I've at least got tools there.
neutral|Whatever your reasons, you've jeopardized the success of this entire concern!
joy|Hell, I plan on getting drunk once I'm done with my shift. Maybe even head over to Gomorrah for a good time.
neutral|I'm afraid a formal ceremony was out of the question given our current state, but I hope this will make up for it.
disgust|Hometown of the Van Graffs, don't care for this place too much.
neutral|This is Lorenzo, a Knight with the Brotherhood of Steel. We'd be very interested in examining your tech.
neutral|Sure, what would you like to know?
neutral|Hello, General.
neutral|Okay, I'll tell the locals you've been keeping an eye on local thugs as a sort of neighborhood watch.
joy|I vaguely recall something about upending a few tables, maybe knocking out one of her doctors. Anyway, that's incredible news!
neutral|Maybe you can track down whatever notes he was keeping and find some thing to help you there.
neutral|Hope to see you soon!
neutral|Through it all, the New Vegas Strip has stayed open for business, under the control of its mysterious overseer, Mr. House,
joy|It feels like you're carrying a Brahmin on your back, but it can take a heck of a lot of punishment.
neutral|Nope. Had a pretty good claim once, way out east by the river, but got run off by Raiders. Eventually, got too old to keep going out.
anger|You've been resourceful in the past. Why are you a failure now?
neutral|Its back is inscribed with the names of the troopers and rangers who carried the weight.
neutral|Hey, pipe down. We can't talk about that here, out in the open.
neutral|We'd be the last to know.
neutral|Most Powder Gangers at the Correctional Facility fled into the wasteland rather than face the advancing forces of the Legion.
anger|You need to work on your bloodthirst. We won't speak again until Benny is dead.
neutral|Need a bigger caliber.
fear|Holy shit! Run for your lives!
neutral|Primm, already torn apart by Powder Gangers, was dealt a killing blow by the Courier.
joy|Name's Raul. Raul Alfonso Tejada. I'm the mechanic around here.
neutral|Caravan work's up north, check with the Crimson Caravan, maybe. Gun Runners might have work, wouldn't know for sure, though.
neutral|Yes, that's the stuff. And the container's shielding must be intact, or you'd be dead by now.
neutral|You're referring to Chris. I doubt you had much luck if you tried telling him that he's human.
neutral|We recently obtained an artillery weapon, but we don't have the part or the skill to fix it.
surprise|Vegas? What, the families? Or... House. You're talking about House.
neutral|What seemed like a simple delivery job has taken a turn for the worse.
neutral|Getting my gear, what does it look like? What, you think I'm going to leave this here for someone like you? I don't think so.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|Something has actually come up. A prospector recently came through here and spent a lot of caps on supplies.
neutral|When the Legion attacked Hoover Dam, General Oliver ordered his troopers back to the middle ground just after first contact.
neutral|Bye.
neutral|What's to negotiate? The NCR backs off, we walk out of here, nobody gets hurt.
fear|Watch for scorpions.
neutral|We never found out what he needed the time for. Wave upon wave of NCR troopers hit us from all directions.
neutral|Think you can get away with this? Guys, time to rough this one up!
neutral|Great, that's all I need to get the rebreather to work right. I don't think you'd want to start breathing water halfway down.
neutral|I see. Spare me the details. Goddamn. She had the yellowest smile...
neutral|Caravan of two now.
neutral|That's true, Rhonda. I am in a unique position to speak to the natural superiority of my kind.
neutral|Frustrated? No. I have my orders - signed, and approved all the way up the chain from Kimball. And I understand the reasons.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
anger|If you can't help me, who can?
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|Caesar honored him with a golden coin, minted in celebration of his contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
neutral|She's my g-g-goddamn partner. See, we work in pairs. We spot for each other. W-watch each other's backs.
neutral|And here's the slice of the world where NCR's hands start slipping.
neutral|The last person stupid enough to follow me down this alley. Get this fool, boys!
neutral|Don't draw any guns and start shooting here - I heard the robots settle that trouble quick.
neutral|They can't guard the roads, they can't put a line of troops around the Mojave... it's just greed that makes the heads back West even try.
neutral|However, our unarmed techniques favor offense over defense. We can charge the enemy and flatten him with our first strike before he can react.
neutral|Being an honorable man, the saloon owner paid for the stranger's funeral, thinking it was the least he could do to repay him.
neutral|Your belongings will be returned to you when you leave.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|Right.
neutral|I'm sure it was very inspiring.
neutral|I have a dangerous one for you - an NCR Ranger by the name of Stella. We got lucky, since we rarely capture Rangers alive.
neutral|Seek Caesar by way of Cottonwood Cove, south of Nelson. The Cursor Lucullus will be waiting.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Specifically, a Securitron. And more specifically, the "someone" was Benny. I know, I know... he shot you in the head and everything.
neutral|But the Followers aren't fighters. We'd get annihilated as front-line medics.
neutral|Lead, and I shall follow.
fear|Corporal White? I don't know where he - uh, I mean, never heard of him. Uh, I gotta go...
neutral|We'll leave it under a rock beneath the old windmill. Think of it as a... as a sign of respect.
neutral|It's getting tougher to discover new things that might interest a traveler such as yourself. I'm sure you understand. So, you interested or what?
neutral|Criminal scum that've infested this region, attacking caravans and regular folk just passing through.
neutral|There's no reason for you to stick around and help us, but feel free to kill a few of the bastards on your way out.
neutral|Later.
neutral|Of course you do! Sorry about that! And it's wonderful that you do!
neutral|You ever had a brother? Some dumbass younger brother, say, who knocked up the pastor's daughter, can't hold a job, and his home-away is a jail cell?
neutral|An alliance? That's an interesting proposition - any plan where I can throw packs of raiders at the enemy instead of my own soldiers is a good one.
neutral|Exactly, Rhonda, who could resist those sweet little faces, and that cute way they shuffle around on all those hands they have.
neutral|How sweet of you to notice, sugar! I've been upgraded to the Mark II software, and it's peachy having these high-explosive weapons fully accessible!
neutral|I may yet, if Caesar commands it.
neutral|With the help of the Gun Runners, the Boomers developed a healthy trading relationship with the NCR.
anger|Not on my watch you won't. You either go with me to the Elder or I put you in the ground right here. Choose.
neutral|For today's studies, please read the next chapter in Programmer's Digest.
neutral|There's something about this I really don't like, and if I weren't tied up here I'd be staking it out personally.
neutral|I suppose he's okay, for one of those. I suppose Pretty Sarah's got to cover every sort of customer.
neutral|Lanius quickly tired of Arcade's acerbic wit and had the doctor crucified.
sadness|Okay, but I'd really like to take a look at him. Remember, I'll be able to give his armor some extra plating while I've got him here.
neutral|I see. And he's not particularly likely to come back, since he's learned that the bunkers here aren't secure enough to serve as safehouses.
joy|Your performance has been nothing short of spectacular. If I have need for a "specialist" of your stripe again, I'll know just where to turn.
neutral|We should not have had to rely on your help in this crisis. I believed my actions were guided by caution and prudence, but I now see the truth.
neutral|Though some Super Mutants and Nightkin continued to journey to the legendary Utobitha, they found little trace of its existence.
neutral|Then we are out of here. Here - a souvenir for you. It's Benny's lighter. Shove it up his ass when you catch up with him.
neutral|Hold up there, that looks like Enclave tech. Take that over to Knight Lorenzo if you get a moment, he may be able to get some information out of it.
anger|No more ammo.
joy|Folks here have access to Lake Mead, fresh drinking water.
sadness|You think he did the right thing?
neutral|For once, I agree.
neutral|They're cautious. When they discover something, they respect it, learn its limits, consider how to preserve it. Used to drive Father Elijah crazy.
neutral|Going on six months, now. But I reckon we'll be moving out, soon enough. Can't talk about the details.
disgust|If what you say is true, then they shall answer for it.
neutral|Keith! In the name of the NCR, I'm placing you under arrest for the sale of unlicensed chems.
joy|Well, you've proven yourself reliable so far. Would you be interested in more important jobs?
joy|I figured you'd say that. Sometimes staying put is the best thing you can do.
neutral|Simple enough to change. I doubt the Legion's listening in on us - they're not that sophisticated - but better safe than sorry, right?
anger|He's a tyrant. The bad kind. And there's no way we're letting him take Hoover Dam.
neutral|It is a dream come true. Santiago never thought he could work in such a wonderous den of vice and iniquity.
neutral|I'm Ruby Nash. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
anger|The last time we discussed this, you didn't exactly wow me with your pitch. What have you got for me this time?
neutral|In fact, one of Mr. House's favorites went missing when we moved the collection. If you have a look around the Lucky 38, you might even find it!
neutral|No, I mentioned you might accidentally get supplied, and I meant it. Not allowed to contract mercenaries at the Outpost.
neutral|Be careful.
neutral|Nah, it's not so bad. The world outside isn't exactly a paradise, you know? Still, you can only breathe recirculated air for so long.
neutral|I have no idea. I just go and do what they tell me.
neutral|Let me take a look.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Possibly, but I'd be the wrong person to ask. You'll need to speak to Dr. Schiller, who's on an errand at one of our other stations.
neutral|I grew up without him. I'll always feel like something is missing from my life. But you're right.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|Yes, Leo, I'm getting to that part! They made me one of them, and they put me to work in an army that was going to conquer California.
neutral|The story says he was set on fire and thrown into the Grand Canyon, but his angry spirit rose from the ashes of his corpse, looking for revenge.
neutral|Thought I might teach you about living off the land, and making useful things for yourself. Interested?
neutral|Those hoodlums he was with seemed to know Manny for some reason. He's our daytime sniper, up in the dinosaur's mouth.
joy|That's it, baby! Show these punks what you got!
neutral|Err, thanks, I guess. Cobb wasn't the problem, though - I could've handled him if he ever found me.
neutral|Don't rightly know - I just got the notion to make my way to New Vegas. Reckon I'll find out when I get there.
neutral|You could also try to find something relevant in our datastore, though last I heard, Scribe Ibsen has having a bit of a problem accessing it.
neutral|You bet I will, I'm almost old enough to fly in the VR sims. That'll be awesome!
neutral|I suppose it couldn't hurt to get another pair of eyes on this. Maybe you'll be able to come up with something coming at it fresh.
neutral|All right, you're healthy enough to handle another one. Which surgery are you considering?
neutral|The Omertas even had a big war with the Khans, once upon a time.
neutral|Right... when we repair stuff, we tend to use welding torches and plasma cutters. I think I still with Loyal and Jack for repair knowledge.
neutral|Fine, but you're making a big mistake. Hardin isn't half the leader that McNamara is.
neutral|How many chips would you like?
joy|Good work with those newcomers. I think you can handle more serious business... with more serious rewards.
anger|How ya like being Mister Good-Two-Shoes, hey? How's it feeling?
neutral|I'll see what I can do, but there isn't much more I can say about you that won't require more caps.
neutral|With Meyers dead and his deputies gone, Primm's only hope is to accept NCR rule. If you run across one of their patrols, tell 'em so.
neutral|We were getting a little worried. Where's your partner? No, on second thought, don't tell me.
neutral|They radioed for reinforcements, but instead of waiting for us, they chased the Khans into the ruins where they were caught in a crossfire.
joy|How'd you know I had a sweet tooth, boss?
neutral|It's been said that Auto-Docs were standard equipment in the underground Vaults where mankind survived when the bombs fell centuries ago.
neutral|Would you like to tell me where you learned such a thing?
neutral|During their stay here, mutants are taught to tolerate, and even accept, the existence of inferior, frail creatures, humans included.
neutral|You are to meet with Cato Hostilius - he'll have more information on ways to eliminate Kimball.
neutral|I've heard they don't allow women in their military, considering them nothing more than breeding stock.
neutral|Well, I'll answer what I can.
anger|You like it any better if I tell you to fuck off?
neutral|Don't take too long, all right?
neutral|Bear in mind that you are now responsible for guarding the secret of his true allegiance. If the NCR finds out, we'll know how that happened.
disgust|\| Wild Wasteland \|Ain't nothing but a hound dog.
neutral|That's supposed to be Driver Nephi? The head's in really bad shape, so I can't authorize a full reward. If he really is dead, we're all better off.
neutral|What? What happened?
neutral|They'll happily charge a fortified position with little more than a sharpened stick if ordered to, and do so without hesitation.
anger|I shall honor your last words... and face you alone, as you request. No man will say I refused your challenge.
anger|Boss, I got a poison situation here!
neutral|Got my post. Don't think I wouldn't go, too - if trouble's hit Nipton, town's got enough camping spots to rack up some easy kills.
fear|The Legate is not a man to be crossed, especially if you're a woman. That's all I will say about it.
joy|Short of canceling our imminent travel plans, that's the best thing you could have said.
neutral|Troike is dead, but I'm sure you know that.
neutral|Great! What do you want me to think about? I can think about You, Here... or Everywhere. What do you want?
anger|All I'm doing is pissing him off.
anger|Used to be just a curiosity. The buildings were pre-War, but it was just as full of raiders and barbarian tribes as anyplace else.
neutral|After traveling with the Courier for a time, he retired and settled down in Outer Vegas, where he would spend his days fixing ancient machinery.
neutral|Get her!
disgust|Hnh. The Outpost lost its charm about three bottles ago, and that was just this morning.
neutral|We don't have the money to pay for the water, so I rigged the pump station to divert water to the local cisterns from time to time.
neutral|Unless you burned the town, don't take blame that's not due. Things are going to get uglier before the year's out.
neutral|It's payback for at least one of my troopers. She'll be glad to know he's dead. Here's your caps.
neutral|We don't have the equipment to take out the convicts, and even if we did we need some extra hands for backup.
neutral|The Legion marched over the Hoover Dam with the help of one who was as brutal and merciless as the worst of them: The Courier.
neutral|You really think so, pal? I'll start looking into it. I bet I can help a lot of people around here.
neutral|It's this... slimy, scaled thing, like a Lakelurk, except no legs. Well, most times. They're like birds, except they stay underwater.
joy|Don't worry, Jack and I have talked it over. We'll talk up the idea of breaking the alliance.
neutral|No, not yet.
neutral|Dynamite's for when you don't have enough bullets, want to clear a pass, or scare off Geckos from a caravan.
neutral|In exceptional cases, teams are sent out to investigate sites or retrieve materials deemed too important to ignore.
neutral|I'm setting the generators to blow, just like you asked. Hit the manual switch, then go topside and deal with the Legion and NCR.
neutral|I'll be here. Just don't expect me to fend off a gang of Super Mutants while you're gone.
neutral|It's not a foolproof solution, but indirect methods rarely are. What matters is that you drove him off without alerting him to our presence.
neutral|Her memories dulled by the pills, she cast aside the recording of her grandchildren, no longer remembering its significance.
neutral|Things remained tense due to numerous incidents, though the Kings were still in nominal control of the area.
neutral|He got better? If he says so. Anyway, 10 of Spades is a good kid - maybe I ought to listen to him for once.
neutral|Sure. Here's what I've got.
neutral|They've been kicked around a lot, but no one's finished them off! Not yet, anyway!
joy|You actually did it? My friend, I am without doubt a genius, but I must say, you've given me a run for my money. Bravo. Bravo.
disgust|And if it's not raiders, Powder Gangers, it's NCR tolls. They need to get the money from somewhere, even if it's Vegas-bound.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
anger|President Tandi, the "founding mother," coddled hostile tribes... but her successors were less naive, so they gave Kimball free rein.
neutral|Bah, I don't even know why I try. It's not like the dumb-dumbs are even going to understand this.
neutral|The means by which the Great Journey is to be accomplished are an article of faith, not to be discussed with outsiders.
neutral|Please, enjoy your stay.
neutral|Not even close. Power armor isn't something you wear so much as use. It's a weapon in its own right, and takes skill to wield.
neutral|You had your chance. Now you die.
neutral|Fuck you, human. We don't all share your wonderful complexion. Some of us have to make do, you know?
neutral|Female, Evil Karma.
neutral|He's clean.
neutral|Just hanging out. Same as usual.
neutral|More travelers stopped by Goodsprings on their way to and from the Strip, and the locals grew prosperous from the traffic.
joy|Very well. This latest victory brings to a close my efforts to reshape the power balance of the Mojave - and not a minute too soon...
joy|Proud of you.
neutral|There were some posters left that were pretty well preserved, which is how we know all this stuff was based on the same guy.
neutral|Damn fine woman, but damn expensive, too. Just ask Saint James - he spends near every cap he gets on Sweetie's sweets.
neutral|Can't feel all my limbs.
neutral|Not the best posting or assignment, but it beats being sent East, or patrolling the Colorado. Legion's pretty thick there.
neutral|Just... stay away from the console. It doesn't do anything...
neutral|I've also got two much more expensive implants. One's a sub-dermal implant that will make you more resistant to damage.
sadness|He put them right on the western part of the dam itself. We don't have enough firepower to hold that spot.
neutral|The NCR called it a "work-release" prison. We lucky prisoners got the privilege of fixing up the rail lines and blasting rock for new lines.
neutral|We'll... we'll pay you. Whatever we got, you can have it. We'll put together a collection every couple of days.
surprise|Can't belive we're fucking back here.
neutral|Sure. What did you want to know?
joy|Great! I've been wanting to get a laser gun for a while now.
neutral|I don't have a mama or papa anymore. I see them sometimes when I take off my medicine, but they can't stay. I'm pretty used to being on my own.
neutral|Oof.
neutral|Shit. Long as I can r-r-remember. Had a rifle in my hand since I was three, that's what my dad always says.
neutral|Well, that and the giant sign outside. This place could have been "The King's House of Dog Chow" and I still would have taken the name.
neutral|Yeah, I'm in charge of keeping this data system up and running, but accessing it is a little, ah, touch and go at the moment.
surprise|You're obviously putting your money where your mouth is - on top of that offer letter, that is a lot of caps.
neutral|The boy means well, but he's dumb as a mutant sometimes.
neutral|All right, pumpkin.
neutral|Our Elder at the time, Elijah, had some kind of obsession with the place. Which is the only reason we stayed as long as we did.
neutral|When the NCR moved to secure the region, they cracked down the hardest on Freeside, sending a full platoon to sweep the neighborhood.
neutral|Except Neil.
neutral|No need to worry about the General's "accident," by the way. A mercy, really, sparing him the disgrace of surviving his nation's defeat...
neutral|You got to be kidding me. You're fine - this is just a ploy to get a free sucker, isn't it?
neutral|If it can be bought, it can be found at Mick and Ralph's!
sadness|That was one of my sisters, but my family always repays our debts. What do you want to know?
neutral|No. Not a chance in hell. I'm not risking this happening again.
neutral|The machine? Harmless, no matter what Trudy says. She thinks it's hiding something, but I think it's just a broken down relic with no place to be.
neutral|We'll leave it under a rock beneath the old windmill. Think of it as a... as a sign of respect.
neutral|That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
neutral|The Tops is the cool place to be right now. Lots of entertainment and shows going on there as well as the gambling.
neutral|Ironic, how this turned out. The thousands of hours I spent calculating odds, running projections, planning for every contingency...
neutral|dizziness,
fear|Be damn careful here.
neutral|Bring your robot to us, we'll see that whatever information it may have on it is used for the greater good.
neutral|What were you doing looking at my terminal? No, never mind that. You can't tell anyone about what you found!
neutral|He had survived police service in Colorado, the Great War, combat duty with the Legion, and being the companion of The King.
surprise|The message? You know about that...?
neutral|With the reactor running at full-tilt, I can boost the transmission strength of the Lucky 38's command and control network!
neutral|Sure! He came through here in a big hurry - didn't even stop to say hello! I think he went down his secret escape elevator out there in the hall!
neutral|Pace, don't do this. I won't stand with you if you do.
neutral|Pinned down here carrying your bags.
neutral|Intel says the legate's coming. Lanius. They call him the Monster of the East. If he's half as bad as Graham was, we're in for a heck of a fight.
neutral|Yeah. I've got the rest of my life to help them out. I can spare a little while to see things through with you.
neutral|Doctor Henry. He's one of you - go speak with him instead of me.
neutral|Get on now, I'll make sure this gets West and let the wheels of law start turning in the courts.
neutral|During the Legion's attack on Novac, Bright Followers, returning from their long pilgrimage, assisted in its evacuation.
neutral|Now we're trying to secure the Strip and the Dam at the same time, and it's costing us.
joy|Oh, sure, boss. I was always good at fixing things. Some I fixed for the town, some I fixed for other people, some I fixed just for the hell of it.
neutral|Don't have any other place to go. I'd just end up back in another prison, or dead out in the wasteland.
neutral|
disgust|And after a respectable military career, what does he do? Become a politician.
neutral|In that case, they'll have our support. We cannot afford to let the Legion win.
neutral|Oh, right. She radioed ahead and mentioned that somebody was coming by. Odd that she'd send a civilian instead of a trooper, though.
neutral|Look me up when you get to New Vegas - I'll buy the first round.
neutral|All right, but this is the last time I can use this line with the townies. I can only discredit so many people.
neutral|But I like its chances.
sadness|Drink. Got a lot of memories to drown. If I die while doing it, so be it. Got nowhere else to go.
neutral|It's too bad Caesar's Legion built its camp right above it. Talk about inconvenient!
neutral|As far as we can tell, the guy that built this place was considered the coolest of the cool, and taught other people how to be more like him.
anger|Maybe fifty rangers will die on that dam. We lose over a thousand troopers every year. Being here is crazy. Getting out's the only sane thing to do.
neutral|
neutral|I'm just a fantasy come to life. But you already knew that.
neutral|Well... all right. I'll stick around for a little while longer, but if you get out of line again...
neutral|What is it? Let me see.
neutral|Yeah, shit indeed happens. I was stripped of my casino apartment and all of my belongings and booted back into Freeside.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
sadness|Of all the people who could learn from our past mistakes, he goes and throws all of our knowledge off of a cliff.
anger|Unless you seek to goad me into a retreat, leaving the battlefield and leaving my honor here to be trampled underfoot by Republic cowards.
neutral|Oh honey, I know you're interested. I just don't go that way is all.
neutral|With the Dam firmly in their grasp, the NCR turned its attention towards wresting the Correctional Facility from Powder Ganger hands.
neutral|Thank you, Rhonda. Today I'd like to talk about a subject near and dear to my heart, the nightkin.
neutral|I hope you've returned with good news. Are they willing to help the NCR?
joy|They shot the shit out of me. I would have died, I think, if I wasn't so full of rage.
neutral|If you don't know what you're doing, you won't even be able to walk with it on. So how about a bit of quick instruction?
neutral|Got me into the caravan business, you know - had to start transporting water instead of liquor, though.
neutral|Vale.
neutral|Fuck you for wasting my time, then.
neutral|I'm sure you mean well, but I'm afraid you'll have to wait until I'm in a calmer emotional state before my memory is going to function.
neutral|The Rangers mostly draw from the basic NCR army. A trooper who shows exceptional skill at fighting and scouting can be nominated for the training.
neutral|Yes! It has been a long time since La Fantoma had a good sidekick!
neutral|Still, I've sent a few skilled men out to make sure their journey is "eventful". It should be a long time before they even think of returning.
fear|I'd just prefer that it goes to an organization like the Followers, who are less likely to use it for... violent purposes.
disgust|Inside? Yeah, must be deep inside, all right.
neutral|You bet.
neutral|I'm fair with chucking dynamite and not bad with a pistol, if I do say so myself. Carry a knife, too, but that's more for practical reasons.
neutral|
anger|This armor's probably fine. The holes are cosmetic.
disgust|Deep? Ain't deep by half. Closed down the bar yesterday, going to close it again today - rinse and repeat.
neutral|No, I think it is. I have to be resolved about this. If I waver, it'll just make things harder.
neutral|From time to time, the NCR has assaulted Brotherhood bunkers. In four of the six incidents I know of, the bunkers self-destructed.
neutral|How many chips would you like?
anger|Better than waking up in jail, I guess.
neutral|Sugar, I may be a robot on the outside, but on the inside, my neuro-computational matrix is an exact copy of Mr. House's favorite girl.
neutral|Don't let his actions bother you. He's only doing what he thinks is best for the chapter.
anger|You need to be tougher. If you let the Mojave get you down, then you've given up on life.
neutral|If I didn't know better, I'd say neither side is confident enough to push for a full victory. Which seems strange given the NCR's technological edge.
neutral|Great, did you change your mind?
neutral|Thanks. Let me know what you find out. Here's hoping she's okay.
neutral|She's with those traders? They've tried to contact us before, but I'm not interested in trading with greedy savages.
neutral|At first they were commended for their valor, but eventually, desperate for more of the chem, they turned on travelers in Outer Vegas.
neutral|You've taken us for a ride, and we want you out.
neutral|Fuck you man, I ain't going nowhere with you.
neutral|That's a good start there, soft-horn, but that's not enough by a long chalk.
neutral|Slain to the last man by the Courier, the Misfits were at least spared the humiliation of dying during Caesar's attack on Camp Golf.
neutral|I heard of one fella what got himself locked in that NCR jailhouse up I-15. Maybe that ain't the best credential, but a sheriff's a sheriff.
neutral|
neutral|I wouldn't mind cutting down a few platoons of NCR troopers with my old gatling laser.
neutral|Please don't hurt us no more. I'm begging you.
anger|Maybe he didn't intend for things to wind up this way, but that doesn't mean he needs to perpetuate this bizarre anachronistic myth.
neutral|Coming from anyone else, I'd say they were drunk or crazy, but that look in your eyes - I believe you.
neutral|Robbed some people, burned some things, killed a few guys.
neutral|Lily's long life finally came to a close in the Mojave Wasteland. As the life faded from her, her last thoughts were of her grandchildren.
neutral|You killed him? But...
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|Damn it, will you die already?
neutral|You should accept his invitation and then murder him when he least suspects it!
fear|They say the Burned Man still walks the land, blackens the earth wherever he sets foot.
neutral|The Fiends attacked Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam and, despite suffering heavy losses, overran it.
surprise|And yet my Legion obeys me, even unto death. Why? Because they live to serve the greater good, and they know of no alternatives.
neutral|Because you're a friend of the Followers, I can give you a bit of a discount.
neutral|While they're in town, the Nightkin aren't allowed to have Stealth Boys so their craziness doesn't get worse.
neutral|Back to the tomb, I suppose. If you need me, et cetera.
neutral|Not much glory in the Enclave. Most of her old comrades are long gone.
neutral|Screw it. Just shoot! They'll get the hint!
anger|Imposter!
neutral|To maximize your chances, wait for my signal before you begin.
neutral|The other option is destroy the dam's generators. Without those, it's just a big bunch of concrete! The NCR won't have any reason to stick around!
neutral|Take a look.
neutral|Novac, it's home for me now. I want that to be for good. I like it here, and I've left too many homes behind.
joy|Groovy, baby! Plant these losers in the ground!
neutral|That's all right, mister. You will someday.
neutral|There'll be some guards by the door, but just remember that the password is "Hope," and they'll let you by right quick.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Oh, I sort of altered the records after we got back. That was Watkins' idea, too. That girl is nothing but trouble.
neutral|What do you want to know?
neutral|I never touched the woman, but the jealous prick decided it was my time to go. He framed me by saying I'd stolen from the casino.
neutral|We've made great strides, sure, but the NCR is not welcomed here, merely tolerated. And even then, not by everyone.
neutral|She was so beautiful... Now I'll never get to know her.
neutral|Can't. The King's got me busy on something.
joy|Yes, I believe that, outlander. We owe you our freedom.
neutral|If the stories are true, he'll be a valuable commodity here at the Wrangler. I appreciate the find.
neutral|The name's Old Ben. I've been living in Freeside since the day I was born.
neutral|Who was Elijah, more like. He was our Elder before McNamara. Bright guy, but just between you and me he was a little off.
neutral|Acceptance into Utobitha open to mutants only. Former human servants of the Master conditionally accepted for purposes of centaur feeding duties.
anger|Yeah, we talked about it, but that went a big fat nowhere.
neutral|You're a strange one, aren'tcha? Fine, what did you want to talk about?
neutral|Subject E: Diagnosis complete. Begin Recording.
neutral|Next, I'd resume patrols in the near vicinity, and begin sending search teams out to the spots the scouts reported were relatively safe.
anger|No, I shall make it a contest - whether I can kill you *before* my hounds tear you apart.
sadness|We must have been on the trail for a week before we got to Rattletail. We lost one woman to Night Stalkers and another almost died of dehydration.
sadness|REPCONN went through some rough times. When their rocket business was shaky, Mr. House purchased the company.
neutral|You came here to finish what you think you started?
sadness|I mean guys who have a world of experience doing what they do, but have to give it up because they're getting old and slow, or too injured.
anger|Just drop it, okay?
neutral|Golf was a president, I think. Maybe for NCR.
neutral|Let's not split up here, all right?
neutral|Sure. Here's what I've got.
neutral|As I've explained, there are numerous dangers to humans here, and we have a duty to drive them away. It's for their own good, really.
neutral|Nah, I'm gonna be busy.
fear|Even if your heart's in the right place, I reckon it might do a lot more harm than good.
neutral|No, I do not require the "services" of a degenerate such as yourself.
surprise|Safety first. That's all I'm saying.
neutral|The dangerous ones are roamers, though there's another group that mostly stays put, over at the prison southwest of here.
neutral|I want... a dress.
neutral|You got a job where even thinking about it would scare a man senseless, that's when you bring in the Rangers.
neutral|But just keeping that dam secure and operational day to day is enough work for one person, never mind building a defense against the Legion.
neutral|Very well. I must confiscate your weapons.
neutral|Okay, just let me know when you want to talk numbers.
sadness|It was necessary to weaken the West, show that the Legion could strike deep into the places where NCR thought it safe.
surprise|I don't think you need to worry about the specifics. Basically, expect a lot of firepower and dead bodies.
anger|No one rules Vegas except me, got it? You're a lowdown gofer! You deliver mail!
neutral|You're doing a fine job of convincing me to go along with this. Really. I'll ask again - why us?
neutral|For a while, you were the toast of the Ultra-Luxe, but you're simply not en vogue any longer. Your act has gotten stale.
neutral|That savages such as these could last so long against the NCR is troubling. Please, take my findings to the Elder. He'll know what to make of this.
neutral|You're looking to get past those tin cans at the gate, right? They let people by all the time, if they've got the caps.
neutral|What'll fight on Blue?
neutral|You won't be allowed to purchase any prohibited equipment, but hopefully some of what's available will prove useful to you.
neutral|All right. This is... this explains a lot of the lost caravans. I thought it was Legion work, but...
anger|When I command you to complete a mission, you will complete it, or you should die in the attempt.
neutral|Sure. I'll tell you what I know.
neutral|Though Novac was a low-priority target for the Legion, many of Novac's citizens died in its defense.
neutral|Look, we're trying to help people here. Put away your money.
neutral|It is no coincidence that two humans have been vital to the success of the Great Journey.
disgust|We were living like scavengers, scraping by on what little food we could find, always looking for medicine for my burns.
neutral|Uh, yeah, actually. I'm still good for the money, but I'll get it some other way. You can tell the old hag I'm gone.
neutral|Okay. Is he still a threat?
neutral|After Hoover Dam, the leaderless Powder Gangers at the Correctional Facility vanished into the wastes, leaving the prison empty.
neutral|Oof.
neutral|Folks say he came from a heck of a tough tribe, took Caesar a long time to conquer. It was thanks to Lanius.
surprise|Legion this far West? You're fucking kidding me.
neutral|We were to normal super mutants what they were to humans, and they were told to defer to us in all things.
neutral|The Legate is crowned as the new Caesar. He entered The Strip as though it was a military target, destroying anyone who resisted him.
joy|You've just fucked up, big time!
neutral|Uh... Hello? Hi. Are you there? Oh, right. You can't respond. Listen, I'm using your robot as a relay to get this message to you.
neutral|One of the Followers of the Apocalypse, I'm sure. They're curious about me.
neutral|Was there something else you wanted?
neutral|In the anarchic months that followed, the Fiends asserted dominance over Outer Vegas.
fear|Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
surprise|Can't believe we got in here.
neutral|Yeah, got this look when he saw you next down on the Courier list. His expression turned right around, asked me if your name was for real.
fear|Run! Beasts got free!
neutral|We are soldiers of a different stripe, capable in battle, but skilled as infiltrators and agents as well.
sadness|I got them into this mess, I owe them that much.
surprise|You never heard of Petro-Chico, un Amigo de Poseidon Energy? Ah, of course not. They were an oil company in Mexico, back before the War.
neutral|Hey, the gang's all here!
neutral|After two centuries of life and decades of service to humanity, Rex collapses and dies.
neutral|Ahh yes, my memory is much clearer now that I am free from my bondage.
neutral|If they've proven hard to kill, yes. Whatever it takes to get the job done, even if means hiring help from outside the military.
neutral|Today, you stand here with our brothers and sisters to hold that line. Today, you honor all Californians by carrying that weight.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
anger|On a slightly more serious note, if you're interested in helping out with the troubles plaguing Freeside, I can come with you.
joy|I don't really have a problem with them. People around here tend to see them as invading marauders planning to burn and pillage the countryside.
neutral|She ensured the fall of Mr. House and the end of the Legion's and NCR's influence over New Vegas.
joy|I could tell you a lot if you had the time, but at my age I'm not sure which of us would get tired first. What do you want to know?
neutral|Despite NCR's pledge to support Primm, they abandon the town after their loss to Mr. House.
neutral|Rustle up enough of them and you can win a prize! So get out there, and start drinking Sunset Sarsaparilla!
joy|But you're a big part of what's happening out here. When you talk to them, they'll understand how important this all is.
anger|Yes, I'd heard something about his untimely death. There will be a lot of questions from his family, so I trust you had nothing to do with this.
neutral|O-Of course not! We're here to serve the good citizens of the NCR. Please, head on through.
joy|As for wisdom... there is wisdom in your words, woman of the West.
neutral|
neutral|Well, having a sheriff who was a convict is better than no sheriff at all... and if he has the qualifications... all right, hand it over.
neutral|Why, did you know he single-handedly reclaimed New Vegas from all those nasty tribes that used to live here?
neutral|You keep losing us business like that, and you can forget about being paid.
neutral|While they prefer to use their blades, it's common for them to scavenge better weapons from their enemies and use those.
anger|Maybe we made a mistake. It was early on, we didn't know just how serious it was out there.
sadness|Yeah, the Brotherhood. Them.
neutral|Me, I'm Knight - Major Knight. I've been stuck here dealing with these caravans for ages now, but somebody's gotta do it.
neutral|Good. That'll save us some time.
neutral|Wasn't long before someone moved into the guy's place and found half-buried human remains in the crawlspace. I didn't bother saying told ya so.
neutral|Hey, I'm sorry, but I've gotta turn around. Leg's giving me some trouble.
sadness|Like I said before, not all Followers are good with people.
neutral|I'll do what I can - and those folks that got killed need to be answered for.
neutral|Come back when your work at the substation is done.
neutral|While battle cattle are indeed a dangerous foe, they are one that should be fought ferociously.
neutral|I have my little helpers out and about, always looking for fresh things to add to the stewpot.
neutral|Mama had liked him so much, she made me use his last name. Said he deserved that much at least, since he never got to meet me or nothin'.
neutral|The condition is that you must complete a task. This task must prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you have what it takes to join the Brotherhood.
neutral|Well, I supposed you could look at it that way, but I was packing a whole different kind of heat. No, escort just sounds better than man-whore.
fear|Things are hectic around here, but it won't mean anything if NCR or the Legion take control. I'm sure the Followers can manage without me.
disgust|I've been around a few unsettling places in my life, but that place takes the cake.
neutral|Guess that settles that, then.
neutral|You're telling me. Not long after my father's shop went under and he passed away from the loss, people around town started experiencing shakes.
sadness|Well-spoken, traveler. Well spoken indeed. Perhaps it's time to find our own destiny unburdened by the past.
anger|Never this... bad before.
anger|Trouble's already come and went, so anything you bring will make my next drink go down easier.
neutral|After the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, the Great Khans returned for a time to Red Rock Canyon.
neutral|You know what? You're right. I looked at the whole thing from the wrong angle.
joy|Cheer up, kid. It's not that bad. Sure, your skin rots off and you start to stink like a public toilet after Cinco de Mayo, but... umm....
neutral|Glad I could help.
neutral|Of course.
neutral|Not everyone dreams of being a revolutionary, I suppose. Maybe we can't all change the world.
neutral|If you must know, my inventory check this week shows that our weapon count is one short. Somehow we're missing a laser pistol.
surprise|What the hell is this shit?
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
anger|You dared go against The Thorn, and now you'll pay for that!
anger|Then gather the tools you need, and study up on your medical skills.
neutral|Some caravans deal with the Legion now because the security. If towns could get the same protection? A lot more tempting than you'd think.
neutral|Male, Neutral Karma.
neutral|Oh, you mean the second generation Super Mutants who aren't so bright?
neutral|That said, I'd know nothing of the Omertas' plot if you'd kept it secret. Perhaps I owe you my gratitude, after all...
neutral|After Mr. House gained control of New Vegas, he sent a Securitron to Goodsprings as a token of appreciation for helping the Courier.
neutral|When it happens enough times, they send someone over to check up on us. Lately, we've been getting extra medical supplies for some reason.
neutral|Oh shit. Oh shit shit shit.
neutral|
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|Four years have passed since the Republic held the dam - just barely - against the Legion's onslaught. The Legion did not retreat.
neutral|They'll be in a world of trouble if Captain Pappas catches them.
anger|Dad used to say this place was what Reno tried to be. Fucking Reno.
neutral|Just another injury to take care of, huh? Well, when you put it that way... all right. You can tell the Lieutenant I finally caved.
neutral|Which suits us just fine. When we first arrived in Freeside, the Kings protested when we kicked out the original occupant of this establishment.
neutral|The bits and pieces we take out are usually worth more than the whole thing put together.
neutral|Heh, well of course not. We just wouldn't want anything to happen to you is all.
neutral|Nah, I've got some rounds to run. But do pass along that I'm always thinking of her.
neutral|Mr. House showed little interest in the Boomers and left them to themselves in Nellis.
joy|Oh, I think I'd like that. A lot. Maybe even give you a discount for my... company.
neutral|Across the river, it gathers strength. Camp fires burn, training drums beat.
neutral|After years of such servitude, during an unguarded moment, Arcade used a surgical scalpel and his bare hands to disembowel himself.
neutral|Yeah... about that...
neutral|Don't worry, not looking to throw punches just yet. And something tells me hitting you would be a mistake I wouldn't want to repeat.
neutral|Be sure to stop on back and let me know when the arrays are fixed.
neutral|Seems a little mean to use his invitation against him like that, but I'm sure it's all for the best!
disgust|As far as those two iron lovebirds go, they've got more spine than you'll see in a year from the NCR government.
neutral|You wound me! You simply must let me have a go at that hair sometime! Anything you can imagine, I can style!
neutral|Sorry, but the Omertas don't look very kindly upon gossiping.
fear|Huh. Good question. Must have been in a book.
neutral|Very well. Do you know what they're up to?
neutral|Patched up. Let's get back to the fight.
neutral|Oh, I don't sell things, ma'am. I sell thoughts.
neutral|I hope they do, but I haven't heard nothing.
neutral|Ah, the "rulers" of Freeside. The Kings are a bunch of boys who refuse to grow up, and this is their playground.
anger|It is the Legion that will surprise the West, but you will not be alive to see it.
neutral|At present, my best guess for finding the items would be to search any of the old vaults in the area.
neutral|Second part? What are you talking about?
neutral|We took the lay of the land, checked out the locals, and kept ourselves inconspicuous. Couple friends of mine were the first to scout the Dam.
neutral|Let me see what I can do.
neutral|Now you're just wasting my time. When you make up your mind, let me know.
neutral|Keeping quiet.
sadness|Tell you what, I'll at least think about it for a while. Ask me about it again another time.
anger|I shall make a cape of your skin. And your skull - it shall sit by my side, mute, watching as my armies march West.
neutral|I'm not really supposed to administer the test more than once, but what the hell? You're the only new face I've seen today.
neutral|Ranger Station Charlie. We're responsible for keeping the highway up through Novac civilized.
neutral|Now, we're happy to have you come on in and spend some dough at the bar, take in a show, whatever - but you're cut off from the games.
joy|Heard stories about the Lucky 38, how nobody's ever gone inside - 'cept you, that is.
neutral|We've had reports of violence against NCR citizens in a neighborhood just to the northeast called Freeside. Ever been there?
joy|Things were good there. Well, maybe not good, but better than Mexico City, anyways. I found myself a little shack and started fixing things.
disgust|And none of that radioactive shit, I'm talking whiskey, not Dixon Whiskey - whiskey.
neutral|Thinking hurts you, too? Aw, I wish I could let you have the one on my head but I can't. It hurts real bad when I don't wear it.
joy|Makes for a powerful gift, in a culture that forbids painkillers and is largely ignorant of medical science.
neutral|They've been good to their word. Put together one hell of a resort hotel, too.
joy|But maybe I'm not a pretty enough damsel for that, huh?
neutral|First things first, though. You go settle things with Ringo and put a bullet between his eyes while I round up my crew and let them in on the plan.
neutral|It's called an Auto-Doc. As the name suggests, it's an automated physician - more or less.
neutral|Keep looking for them. The information they have is vital.
disgust|NCR's sharecropper farms had all of the water. The nearest fresh source is the lake, and that's a bit of a hike.
anger|This shit is not going to come off, I'm telling you.
anger|Mojave happened - hit by raiders packing some heavy firepower. Can't believe the Crimson Caravan haven't heard.
neutral|Did I just say "exploiting?" That's not a very nice word!
neutral|Has me send on the "corrected" order for six couriers along with a bunch of letters and numbers, like some kind of code or something!
anger|Hey, talk to Pappas if you've got complaints. I'm just want to be done with this shit.
surprise|What kind of fucking negotiator are you? Hope Alice knows the kind of snake she's got working for her.
neutral|Take a look.
neutral|One mean son of a bitch. Really, truly hates the NCR for some reason, and he got a lot of the other guys around to his way of thinking.
anger|Save your speeches, we will take Hoover Dam and move forward until our feet crush the setting sun beneath them.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|We'll get it eventually, but it's frustrating that it's taking so long.
neutral|I'm on duty here. I don't have time to chit-chat.
neutral|First things first, though. You go settle things with Ringo and put a bullet between his eyes while I round up my crew and let them in on the plan.
neutral|After all, I have to save up for my ticket out of here, right?  So how about it? Want a tip?
neutral|I heard some of the Troopers are sneaking up on the rooftops and lounging around and drinking beers instead of working.
neutral|The NCR's pressing need to expand proved greater than its promise of amnesty, and before long the government decided the Khans had to go.
anger|So tell me this, because I really want to know. I am feared - with good reason.
neutral|Let's hope that Betsy sticks with the treatment. Knowing her, she won't keep seeing Usanagi if she feels things are taking too long.
neutral|There you have it - New Vegas, pretty as a diamond flush.
neutral|If personal gain... what you sought... should've done... as asked...
neutral|Crocker was probably counting on me being able to offer the Kings a carrot. And that's what I'm inclined to do.
neutral|He was prouder still to see the area freed from the shackles of the NCR and Mr. House.
fear|It helped, but we've still got a grenade range inspection to pass.
neutral|In what currency would you like your payout? Non-caps currencies will have fractions paid out in caps.
neutral|You let your mind wander back a ways, and you lose sight of what's in front of your eyes. Good way to miss a mark.
neutral|We'll be there when you need us.
neutral|I might be going scum-hunting later. You game?
neutral|So long as you can keep us supplied, we will stay in the Mojave to provide care and education for those in need.
surprise|They're family, you dig? They've always looked out for us, made sure we had something to eat and a place to crash.
joy|Believe me. When I heard the news, my first thought was, I owe somebody. Big. I figured Boone would come around after a while.
neutral|The NCR has its hands full now, of course. I doubt they'll raise much of a fuss.
neutral|
neutral|Already struggling, NCR's supply lines suffered further as the two caravans withdrew support until the "massacre in the East" was resolved.
joy|It's big, it's bright, and it's one of the biggest cities still left from before the War. Well, mostly, anyway.
neutral|Sprinkle in a little compassion for people outside their group and healthy disrespect for authority, and voila. Followers.
sadness|Cass lived to see the mark of the Legion on Hoover Dam. Uncertain of what lay next for the West, she remained silent.
joy|Now to find a bar.
neutral|Most people know when to hang it up and start over. But not Moreno.
neutral|Now all I need is the thrust control modules.
neutral|This place had been briefly discussed as a fallback point, though at the time none really believed that could possibly become necessary.
sadness|More than anyone cares to count up. And even if we do stop him, I don't see how we're ever going to be able to pull out.
surprise|You forget about me already, boss? You sure you didn't take a blow to the head or something?
neutral|With the King dead and most of their gang slain by the Courier, the remaining Kings fled the area, never to be heard from again.
anger|Feel... weak all of a sudden.
neutral|With New Vegas' independence formally declared, Goodsprings thrived.
neutral|That's it! We got it! The virus has been purged!
sadness|Why free me now? After what you done? I ain't saying thank you.
neutral|It's pretty much common sense, but it gets invoked a lot when people get pissy about following orders.
joy|Vegas might see a dip in revenue for a few months, half a year - but soon enough the tourists - and their money - will be pouring in.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|Life can be pretty rough sometimes.
neutral|In fact, I've heard that many are assuming the NCR did it without even looking into the matter. This is the worst thing that could possibly happen!
disgust|Yeah, now where would we find an experienced computer specialist in the NCR? We'll find one, don't you worry.
neutral|What? No, that... that's brilliant! It would let us seal a portion of the virus to a particular terminal, even when the other parts move.
anger|This again. What makes you think I've changed my mind?
surprise|No shit? I guess the next thing we need to do is hang out and wait for the rest of my gang to show up so we can talk about the plan.
neutral|Cook-Cook, one of the fiends, ambushed her and Ten of Spades. They both managed to escape, but not before Cook-Cook raped her.
neutral|Watch your six out there.
neutral|Aww, someone wants to hear grandma's stories! What would you like to hear, pumpkin?
anger|So no, I can't tell you what to expect inside the base. No one's been inside it, except them.
neutral|In the name of the Elder, I hereby sentence you to death.
neutral|Hey. I, uh, I can't go in with you. I'll wait here, okay?
sadness|My weapon broke. Probably my fault.
neutral|Anyway, that was the first time. Second time I fell down those stairs in front of the motel. Just in case I got to thinking I'd put it all behind me.
neutral|As she walked along the Dam in the night, she felt drunk, content, and happy to be alive. Which to her, was the whole point of it all.
neutral|Yet you failed, and you must pay.
neutral|I was prepared to make several significant upgrades to the machines.
neutral|Don't look like nothing too serious. Lemme patch you up.
neutral|The Legion brutally occupied all major locations, killing and enslaving a large amount of the population.
neutral|What about it? Do you have some advice?
neutral|If that's the only thing about me that's like him, that's enough for me.
neutral|I'd like a large Atomic Shake and a double Brahmin burger. And easy on the agave sauce this time.
neutral|Why, indeed. But now there's not a single first generation Super Mutant in Utobitha.
neutral|That'll do nicely. I'll spin some stories about how you stopped a mugging or two and saved a kid's pet rat from certain doom!
neutral|ED-E remained forgotten in the shop of Johnson Nash, until it was repaired by another courier who let it continue on its journey to Navarro.
neutral|I can give you something to bite down on if you want. This'll hurt.
neutral|Boone spat tobacco in his eye, for all of Caesar's armies to see.
anger|I'm not sure why you thought a Follower would want to help Caesar after all of the misery he's visited on us and the people we try to help.
neutral|Very well.
neutral|The guard in the weather station will return the Chip to you when you're ready for Caesar's mission. Otherwise, we can return to Cottonwood Cove.
neutral|Knight, he's at Mojave outpost.
joy|Back to Vegas, shall we? I really should do something about that monorail - with all the new resources at hand...
neutral|They'll eventually send more men after her, but I'm sure I'll come up with a better solution to the problem by then.
neutral|You think you're the first person the Elder's trusted with this? He sent three of our patrols out looking for those components, and they're all dead.
neutral|Ah, yes. I think I know which friend you mean. Even if there weren't Deathclaws in the quarry, there'd still be no delivery.
neutral|Whenever you get a chance, can you bring your robot back to Hidden Valley so I can take a look at it?
neutral|So we're in a holding pattern here. And Caesar's on the other side of the river, planning.
neutral|After their suicidal last stand at Hoover Dam, the Great Khans ceased to exist as a tribe.
neutral|Little escapes the notice of Caesar. He has eyes everywhere.
neutral|All this time we've been running the Mark I operating system, which doesn't have drivers for our primary weapons! Imagine!
neutral|
neutral|But with this guy, it might have cost me some bad burns or an ass-rape. I'm all for risking my life, but I'm a little sensitive about my asshole.
neutral|First thing I'd say his get his sorry butt outta there.
neutral|You're a man of your word, no doubt about it. I can't thank you enough.
anger|If I don't get some ammunition soon, Leo's going to start chopping!
neutral|Got nests for planes here.
neutral|Give me all of your ca- whoa, I'm sorry. I-I didn't know it was you. Please don't hurt me. I've got a wife! And kids! And pets and stuff!
neutral|Equally clear was that Chris should labor in blessed ignorance of his humanity, and his inability to make the journey himself.
anger|That was fucked up.
joy|You mean, Mitch? It's been ages since I've heard the name. My sister and I used to call him "Mole-butt." Don't ask.
neutral|Ranger combat helmets are old Pre-War gear. They have built in low-light optics. Makes a big difference.
neutral|You talking about that chip? Man, I don't think he's giving it up.
anger|We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
joy|Oh, it's cool, man, I got your back.
anger|Until you do find me something, though, know that I still plan to lead the Great Khans to fight for Caesar.
neutral|That thought had crossed my mind as well, actually. Fine, make it 2000 caps and we'll call it square.
neutral|During the NCR's retreat from the Mojave Wasteland, he helped defend NCR citizens and refugees on their way to Mojave Outpost.
anger|"Demands NCR's immediate withdrawal..." Withdrawal? Like fucking hell we're withdrawing... we just held the dam, we didn't do it to let it go!
neutral|Make it quick. I got shit to do.
neutral|ARCHIMEDES II orbital laser bombardment will commence in T-minus 5... 4... 3... 2... 1.
neutral|He wasn't a brilliant strategist. Wasn't tactically flexible, either. There was something about him, though. Menace, indestructibility.
neutral|These melded well with his own memories of the Legion, and his new mind quickly adjusted to the myriad memories.
neutral|I'm also handy with tools, and once in awhile I venture down into the valley to trade Big Horner hides and meat for supplies.
disgust|Anders got back a little while before you did, he told me what happened. If that's how the Legion treats my people, I don't want any part of them.
surprise|You destroyed the Brotherhood's bunker? Very well.
neutral|The Great Khans come this way once in awhile, but they keep their distance. I think they're mostly keeping an eye on us.
neutral|We'll... we'll pay you. Whatever we got, you can have it. We'll put together a collection every couple of days.
surprise|They keep being told that victory is right around the corner, that Vegas will roll over, become the sixth state of their little union.
neutral|I see the wisdom in that. I'll radio for a unit to head up to Primm and offer some additional support.
neutral|What, Caravan? All right, I'll give it a go. Haven't exactly got much of a line of folks to serve.
neutral|Allow me to introduce myself! I'm a PDQ-88b Securitron, but you can call me Yes Man!
neutral|Welcome to sin. Watch where you step.
anger|You can thank the NCR for that one. Wait - this isn't on behalf of the NCR, is it?
neutral|There, they reconnected with the Followers of the Apocalypse and rebuilt their strength.
neutral|Most of the time, I'm Doctor Henry's research assistant. We're looking into ways to cure the, uh...
neutral|I'm still laying low.
anger|You there! Stop!
neutral|There you have it, Utobitha! Nightkin, your benevolent overlords, who are most certainly *not* crazy. We'll be back after this!
anger|Fuck off.
joy|As long as you keep working to help people around here get a fair shake, sure, I'll lend a hand.
neutral|I can make sure it not only runs, but runs on time. Always bothered me, the imprecision.
neutral|All right, come back any time.
neutral|Say no more, say no more... if you say they're good, they're good!
anger|The risks outweigh the rewards. Go back to their bunker and finish the job.
neutral|Ten seconds!
neutral|Their store is just past the Wrangler, and sells all kinds of fancy weapons that most people around here can't afford.
neutral|If I could stop it from happening, I would! I mean, your vengeance is going to feel so incomplete!
neutral|Isn't this exciting? I know I'm excited!
disgust|Thanks, boss. I'd hate to think I was disappointing you with my life-altering decision.
neutral|Sorry to have bothered you, then.
neutral|Go to him. He'll have further instructions.
neutral|NCR just has some shaping up to do. Maybe Caesar kicking them in the nuts is a nice wake-up call, is all I'm saying.
neutral|
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
disgust|If you're looking for NCR's spine, ain't going to find it here.
neutral|Should that happen, it will quickly become impossible to breathe here in the bunker. Already the air quality begins to slightly worsen.
neutral|Couple dozen, I'd say, most of them posted at stations like this one. We either man the station or patrol the immediate area.
neutral|I warned you!
anger|Caesar's will is the will of the Legion. And the West... all beneath the flag of the Great Bear exist to test the strength of the Legion.
neutral|Think I might've killed my last legionary.
neutral|You might use that against them. Or kill them another way, it's up to you. Return when it's done.
neutral|General, we like your hat.
disgust|Where? Like Vegas? Chewed and spit enough friends out. East? Get put in one of Caesar's little "camps?" No thanks.
neutral|Yeah, right before I beat somebody down. Let's take this fool, boys.
neutral|All right, then. Looks like I need to talk slow and use small words. There's Sweetie, Maude, and Jimmy.
anger|There's a handful of greasers down in the sewers causing trouble. They ain't packing too much iron, but I'd like them dealt with all the same.
anger|Troopers have enough to deal with. We don't want them questioning their intel.
neutral|Here is what we have available.
neutral|Mostly administrative work, helping coordinate intel on the radio. That and keeping an eye on the fires growing across the water.
neutral|Right away!
neutral|After the battle of Hoover Dam, the NCR mounted several campaigns against the Boomers, but all were quickly ended by the Boomers' artillery.
neutral|He just didn't listen. And the idea that people talked back to him...
neutral|I think that'd be best. There's a Followers outpost up near one of my old scavenging grounds. Used to do some trading with a doctor there.
neutral|They just have a thing about technology! They think it should all be theirs! If someone else has it, they get mad!
sadness|Legion fires. They burn high wherever the Legion goes.
neutral|Hey, listen, I'd love to sell you some more info, but you've tapped everything I've heard lately.
fear|We go across that launch, we may not come back.
neutral|Eventually the stories concerning the duo were collected and published, and proved to be quite popular with children.
neutral|The items I'll need to keep the system running are a differential pressure controller, a reverse pulse cleaner, and several  HEPA cartridge filters.
neutral|Done.
neutral|I thought nobody has ever been inside that place.
anger|You do know why I wanted to meet you, right?
neutral|I wouldn't be much use stuck inside just one Securitron! No, if the one I'm in turns up a goner, I just find another, fine as cream gravy!
disgust|Can't spare men for patrols or escorts, so caravans are backing up here like a Brahmin with a bottle in its ass. Typical NCR bullshit.
neutral|It can treat broken bones, cuts, punctures, scrapes. Sometimes I bestow its use upon someone I favor.
neutral|Remain diligent, outsider. If those patrols are in trouble, every second you delay lessens their chances of rescue.
fear|Baby, you can't just leave me tied up! Those Legion boys'll hoist me up on a cross for the mess you made - if I'm lucky!
sadness|Aside from the people in the towns, it's the soldiers that suffer for it most.
neutral|Grandma has to take her pills now, dearie!
disgust|No caravans in, out, and just try arguing with Jackson about it. "Roads aren't safe," he says.
neutral|And you're the leader of all the nightkin, correct?
neutral|Thanks for the help. We'll find our own way out.
neutral|I knew I should've been an actress.
disgust|I don't see anything wrong with you.
anger|Fine. I'll stick with you. Just remember this. If you want something from Caesar, sooner or later you'll have to give him his due.
neutral|After lifting the lockdown, the first thing I'd do is send scouts out to recon the area. We need to know what's going on out there.
joy|Enough words, then. Let our strength settle this.
anger|You think we would march without a means of resupply? We have the Fort, we will have the Dam - other communities will fall.
neutral|Shoot.
anger|Okay. I just wanted you to confirm that I'm traveling in the company of an insane fascist. Thanks.
neutral|I haven't breathed a word about the officer we planted here - he continues to radio intelligence to Caesar's camp nearly every night.
neutral|Pace? He and I grew up together around here. We've been through a lot together, and there's no man I'd rather have at my side in a pinch.
anger|You want me to make tracks out of here, head back West, tail between our legs?
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|Your guess's as good as mine. Probably better.
neutral|What should we talk about next?
neutral|Hey, I can't really move, now. But I'll follow you in spirit.
neutral|You have? Wow! That's amazing! You can murder Mr. House whenever you want!
neutral|Anyway, I've seen pictures. One guy even had one above his bar in Redding, except it was made of Pre-War plastic.
neutral|Can't use this anymore.
neutral|Okay.
neutral|It's filled with people that take action and don't wait for someone to say what's right and what's wrong and make sure the proper form's filled out.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|Oh - Knight. You must not be from around here. If so... it doesn't do to get too friendly.
neutral|But we simply can't have anyone waving their weapons around in the hotel.  It's not the atmosphere we wish to cultivate.
neutral|This is what I have right now.
neutral|You shouldn't say things like that where Leo can hear you, dearie. He doesn't like it.
neutral|By the time they realize they aren't under attack, the plane and the bots will be long gone.
neutral|You set the pace.
neutral|Bye.
neutral|I also help keep the town clear of radscorpions and coyotes. Not many people live in Goodsprings, so wildlife is always creeping in.
neutral|One of my patrols was on its way back from Novac when it came under fire from the Great Khans.
neutral|Here's another one of my print-outs! Read up!
joy|Here's all the caps I've saved up so far. See? That's a pretty good chunk of what I owe right there!
neutral|The few surviving members dispersed, joining up with other tribes and gangs across the Mojave, and quickly forgot their heritage.
neutral|It took more time than anticipated for a cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia to be found, but in the end it was beneficial to Jacobstown.
neutral|We had packed the old city with C4 and dynamite. Crude, but it did the job. Those who didn't die in the blast were in no position to mount a defense.
neutral|Okay, I admit it. They've been collecting dust since before I got here. You can have them dirt cheap.
anger|You've seen it yourself. Some of them don't even have proper service rifles or armor.
neutral|Our entire two hundred years of history say that a handful of troops with the best equipment and training can stand up to any army.
neutral|Yes, wanderer?
neutral|Near as I can tell, it was some sort of religious institution.
neutral|Don't get me wrong, he's a good man, but Elder McNamara's done all right by us. If it weren't for him, none of us would have survived at HELIOS.
surprise|No idea why the highest point in the Mojave is so rad-lit.
neutral|But that's all I've heard. If I knew more, I'd try to bilk you out of more caps. You interested in one of my other tips?
anger|I'm starting to think you haven't been paying attention, boss.
anger|If you ain't drinking, then leave. If you're making to see if I'm an easy lay, I got a caravan shotgun that'll cure that desire right quick.
neutral|I think I see now what you intend to set in motion.
anger|You even disrupted a promising weapons deal with the Van Graffs.
joy|You freed the Centurion Silus from McCarran so that he might be punished for his cowardice.
anger|I wouldn't trust Benny to lick my boots clean. This one falls to you.
anger|I'll hold you to that promise, then. I'm not known for my patience, though.
neutral|Guess they chose this spot to spy on Caesar.
neutral|Really, Outsider? I'm open to ideas.
neutral|Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though.
anger|This weapon's on its last legs.
neutral|All right, I'll head back to the Old Mormon Fort. If you need me, just swing by.
sadness|It took some people getting killed to realize I had gone too far. I had to stop.
fear|What lottery? The lottery, that's what lottery! Are you stupid?
anger|You squandered a potentially valuable resource. Do better with your next assignment or there will be trouble...
surprise|Hey, it's not like I'm super-attached to working with Caesar or anything, but if it'll stop his patrols from harassing my runners, I'm all for it.
neutral|Whole things smells of Caesar to me. 'Course, that's just guesswork, but I'd still bet a few caps that he's stirring up the locals against us.
neutral|Life's harsh, but still, it beats the hell out of the desert. We've got numbers, we've got food, and we've got trade. That's progress, stranger.
neutral|You think I'm handsome? Wow, I wonder if she does, too!
neutral|The Thorn is my master, not the other way around. I live to make our kin able to transcend their limitations.
neutral|If we keep the dam running, we can sell all its electricity to the NCR for a nice profit. Vegas doesn't need it!
disgust|The name's Knight. Billy Knight. And this here is what a lifelong career in comedy will get you.
neutral|Okay children, it's time to read another chapter from The Patriot's Cookbook.
neutral|I don't see nothing wrong with you.
disgust|I don't see anything wrong with you.
anger|No, you tricked us once, and taking more gifts from you deeper into NCR's just asking for trouble by my book.
neutral|
neutral|Still, I'm not about to add blood to the mix since you could've done us like the Legion now if you wanted.
neutral|The NCR, battered by the loss of the Dam, were unable to devote any troops to retaking the Correctional Facility from the Powder Gangers.
neutral|
neutral|Got a special discount for you, after what you done for us.
anger|No! Queenie! Hahahaha! I'm going to burn the world for you, Queenie!
neutral|No cause for alarm - you'll have an escort of Securitrons to help you fight your way onto the dam.
neutral|Though NCR repulsed the Fiends, they suffered heavy losses in the process.
neutral|For our sake, I hope you're right. I guess I should thank you for bringing me to my senses. So... thanks.
joy|I was planning on sitting this one out, but for some reason I can't help but like you. I'm with you.
anger|What's it look like, you asshole?
anger|All I know is that you are a bad person and I don't want to be around you anymore. So if that was your goal, congratulations.
neutral|No, but there really ought to be. I'm just taking the initiative, is all.
neutral|I miss hanging out with the other students all the time, but at least I get to skip all those boring lectures.
neutral|Yeah, well, don't count on us sticking around if things get too hot. We're not a suicide squad. I'll go to this reunion.
neutral|That's right! I, Tabitha, will take on the burden of your obedience!
neutral|In particular, the air filtration system simply cannot handle the quantity of sand and grit that it's been forced to cope with these last few years.
neutral|Ah - you must be the courier who's been of service to us lately. I'll take you to my Decanus at once.
neutral|Oh all right. You did the legwork, so I suppose you deserve a tip. Here.
neutral|Oh, I've already heard. The Kings are up in arms. The entire area is gripped by chaos and the violence has only increased.
neutral|What puzzles me is why these men have been allowed to run wild for so long unchecked. Why has the NCR not retaken this place?
neutral|Sorry if that was getting boring!
neutral|Though the citizens take out a few Legionaries, the town quickly falls to Caesar, its citizens utterly wiped out.
neutral|Take this print-out. It'll tell you what to do!
surprise|You're saying... they might need to do the same thing to each other some day. And evidence is easier than bullets.
joy|Already forgotten!
neutral|Hurry! We've got to get some before they notice us!
disgust|It looks like our little town got itself dragged into the middle of something we don't want anything to do with.
neutral|Your guess is good as mine. You might luck upon someone who's a natural-born sheriff.
neutral|What precisely about them did you wish to discuss?
neutral|
neutral|
neutral|However, after we had fully recuperated, our first scouting measures showed that the NCR's presence in this region had only increased in our absence.
disgust|But to say they deserved it? What kind of devil are you, boss?
neutral|Their men, however, are typically quite large, in phenomenal condition, and prefer close-quarter weapons.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|Oliver can't stand that rangers got credit for victory at Hoover. Whatever I recommend, he does the opposite. I said I wanted them on the ridge.
sadness|Your memory is like a steel trap, boss. What do you think of guys like Ranger Andy?
neutral|He's clean.
neutral|Hahaha! That's not funny, you getting shot in the head.
neutral|"How about a drink?" How about a couple, is what you mean.
neutral|Stay where you are. I'm sending someone up to meet you.
fear|I mean, I didn't expect that you'd want to... activate the super weapon or anything.
neutral|That'll wake up the Securitron army you left on standby and give us enough force to push the Legion and the NCR straight out of the Mojave!
neutral|Do it, then. You're not leaving until it's done and Caesar lives.
neutral|What do ya say, want another tip?
neutral|All right.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Having all the food we want ain't a bad idea, actually. Getting sick of eating prison rations.
neutral|Think you're doing well to have made it this far?
joy|That's just super! I thought we'd never see a different New Vegas, one that belongs to the people.
surprise|No shit? Drink's on me, then.
neutral|Almost as good as Leo....
surprise|At least the mess is ours to clean up.
neutral|Make sure you have a backup weapon, Fiends don't go down easy.
neutral|Instead, the two sides maintained a long stalemate, and after an extended time the slavers rose up and slaughtered the NCR to the man.
neutral|We didn't get a say. Don't know how you'd argue with a fella like that anyways, everywhere and nowhere all at once.
neutral|Follow me. Make any trouble, and you'll wind up on a cross - if you're lucky.
neutral|Who knows what it's programmed for? Maybe tomorrow you'll take out an iguana-on-a-stick and that'll activate its mini-nuke self-destruct sequence.
neutral|Come back when you've made some progress.
neutral|The Courier, fair and even-handed in his dealings throughout the Wasteland, was honored by the NCR for his support of the military at Hoover Dam.
neutral|Everything was going according to President Kimball's plan at first. We met minor resistance from local troublemakers.
neutral|Comm rangers might have an incomplete picture of the situation. There's a lot going on out there.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thank you for coming out here today for this very special occasion.
anger|I've even heard one of their leaders, the Legate or something, goes around with a human skull on his head. Savages to the last.
neutral|Oh, yeah. F-fine. Just a little st-st-stutter. Had it since I was a kid. Doesn't stop me from k-kickin' ass.
neutral|All right.
joy|Ah, excellent. I received word you may be coming. We helped the receptionist over at Gomorrah with some thugs that were taking advantage of her.
neutral|Their leaders destroyed by the Courier, the Fiends scattered throughout the wasteland.
neutral|Great, this is going to require an epic tale of heroism...
neutral|Yeah. He doesn't look very tough, though. I hear he's afraid I'll shoot him down from one of the windows when I see him, and he's right.
fear|Watch out for the Kings, they're unpredictable.
disgust|It really, really didn't.
neutral|It does not matter, victory shall be ours, it shall be swift, and it will be honest, purchased with blood.
surprise|Not sure I'm having any impact here, boss.
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
neutral|So one day a man, a saloon owner in a small town, decided to make a new type of soft drink, and asked his patrons what flavor they'd like it to be.
neutral|This key will allow you to use our safehouse to the northeast. I hope it will prove useful in your travels.
neutral|The virus just jumped! Find which terminals it went to!
neutral|Uh... Hello? Hi. Are you there? Oh, right. You can't respond. Listen, I'm using your robot as a relay to get this message to you.
neutral|If the Elder could manage it, he'd shut them out as well, and all in the name of security. Which is why we need to replace him.
neutral|You speak with conviction, and more importantly, with honor. And we secured a foothold on the Dam... easily, as you have said.
neutral|Okay, hurry back. I don't want anyone to start shooting at me.
neutral|After a brief fanfare for a life full of accomplishments, Chief Hanlon retired and returned to the peace and quiet of his ranch in Redding.
neutral|All right, let me do a quick test to make sure your body can handle another implant...
joy|Ahh, sarsaparilla. That's just what this dry old throat needs.
neutral|I'm currently investigating the local Nightstalker population since they seem to have developed a natural stealth field.
neutral|Oh, God, I don't know if I can do this.
neutral|Well aware of the full extent of their power, Caesar commanded his troops to not pursue them.
neutral|Freeside's a rough and tumble place, but it also belongs to the Kings. You have one of us with you, and everyone else'll give you a wide berth.
neutral|Nothing. Want to head to the Wrangler later?
neutral|Goodbye.
joy|Do you think you could leave your robot with me for a few days? I have some materials that I can use to upgrade his armor while he's here.
neutral|Do me a favor and let Usanagi know Corporal Betsy is coming. I'd like to make sure the medical clinic has time for her.
fear|Sorry, youngster. I'm a trader, and if something's got value, I can't give it away for nothing.
neutral|Note that you'd have to drink a heap of Sunset Sarsaparilla to match the quantities used in the study. How much, you ask?
fear|Run! Beasts got free!
neutral|Hold up there, that looks like Enclave tech. Take that over to Knight Lorenzo if you get a moment, he may be able to get some information out of it.
neutral|No. I haven't seen anything suspicious. It's been business as usual.
neutral|Those vaults were usually built much like these military bunkers, even using the same contractors in their constructions at times.
anger|Wouldn't say no to something to ease the pain. Granted that's usually the case, but right now especially.
neutral|Like I said before, give me 700 caps and Rey's brain is yours.
neutral|Done.
anger|I'm not here to make money, I'm here to watch the NCR supplies for the dam and that means no supplies for you.
neutral|I... Oh, of course I have, dearie. How silly of me. I didn't take my medicine yet today. How can I help you?
neutral|Following the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, Freeside came to be known as one of the more stable areas in the region.
sadness|Yeah, well, that's the way it used to be. Now that Benny's gone, it's just me in charge.
neutral|Oh, I see. Well, I guess I'm off to see my admirer now.
neutral|In that case, I commend you for your initiative. What do you recommend for next steps?
neutral|Good point.
disgust|If you're looking to get perverted, go talk to Sweetie. She's less particular than I am.
anger|No offense intended, but why should I go anywhere with you?
neutral|They built this little shanty town around a well in the middle of nowhere. Called it Rattletail.
neutral|Let me know when it's done and I'll roll over to the Lucky 38. If I'm right about the Chip, I should be able to install myself on House's mainframe!
neutral|Did you just-? How dare you belch in the face of a Paladin of the Brotherhood of Steel?!
neutral|Not without Pearl's permission, and she hasn't given permission.
neutral|With the M-235 Missile Launcher, we can engage ground and air targets at long range!
joy|That's it - sock it to the Legion, baby!
neutral|Big Sal and Nero split their time in Zoara overlooking the main casino floor from the balcony. No one but Family is allowed up there, though.
neutral|Thanks, I'll spin up some tales of you slaying some nasty critters infesting some of the local homes and donating the leftovers to charity.
neutral|That's right. Fuck off.
neutral|Four years ago, we held this dam. Four years ago, we carried the weight.
neutral|Yeah, look... he's not my real father. He just looked after me, for a while.
neutral|Though Novac was a low-priority target for the Legion, many of Novac's citizens died in its defense.
neutral|My terms are the same as before. They pay off my debt to the Omertas, and I get a big fucking severance package.
neutral|Named this place after the hotel.
neutral|Why don't you go cry to your wife, then - oh that's right! She left your worthless stinking ass!
disgust|And you know what? I'm not going to stick around to try to figure it out. At least legionaries have the excuse of being born into it.
anger|Ah, it's stupid, boss. I used to listen to the radio broadcasts, just to pass the time.
neutral|I already told you that I'm fine. I don't need a head doc.
neutral|So far the brass haven't mustered up enough men to take the prison back. Long overdue if you ask me. But I'm just one man.
neutral|Outpost, Mojave Outpost. Watching a lot of nothing, feels like a big Brahmin pen for caravans.
neutral|I might be going scum-hunting later. You game?
neutral|<bark!>
neutral|Stay where you are. I'm sending someone up to meet you.
neutral|Pass the bottle.
fear|And... uh... well. These uh... these boys with you? Hello, there, smiley.
neutral|The Van Graffs are going to be tougher, so we'll likely get killed there. If we go to the Crimson Caravan camp, we'll just need a lot of bullets.
neutral|Kind of curious how this is going to pan out in the long run... but I'll guess history'll tell us in its own sweet time.
neutral|That's the last of the ammo.
neutral|It turns out there are two ways we can win this thing! Hear that? We have options!
anger|I guess maybe I went a little crazy then. I took my guns, and I went back to that market. I didn't have many bullets, but I had enough.
neutral|Maybe you are and maybe you aren't, but I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
sadness|She made her way back West and passed away in a small shack outside of Vault City, the rose pendant still around her neck.
neutral|Injured... ha! This is just a nick. If you can't tough it out and you want to be fixed up it'll cost you 50 caps.
neutral|Eventually, Rex's mind settled peacefully, melding his own memories with that of long travels with Old Lady Gibson.
neutral|Raul! Why are you on the radio?
neutral|A while, I guess. I don't keep too careful track of time.
neutral|Great! A Ranger named Grant has been placed in charge of security for the President's visit. You'll want to talk to him.
neutral|The rangers heroically assisted NCR's troopers in their ill-fated defense against the overwhelming power of Caesar's Legion.
joy|Good. Glad you didn't kill them. Letting them walk away proves we're not bloodthirsty mutants.
neutral|Be glad you will not have to face his judgment... if you are true to Caesar.
anger|Really? That two-faced son of a bitch. I'm glad now that we kept him mostly out of the loop. Look, we could use your help with some things.
neutral|I represent the Nightkin. Marcus may lead this town, but the Nightkin listen to what I have to say.
anger|Answer the question.
neutral|It is no secret. Our interest here is two fold.
neutral|Really? An army of Securitrons - upgraded, no less? What a development!
neutral|All aboard!
neutral|loss of visual acuity,
neutral|The Legion are a bunch of savages, though. No idea why they'd want the Dam. Probably plan on destroying it or something.
neutral|Stay safe.
anger|Somebody's asking for a boot in their fusebox.
joy|Awwww. Now ain't that sweet.
neutral|Turn around and leave, and I'll... I won't attack you any further.
neutral|Some of which I'm not proud of, but I do my best to help around town when needed.
neutral|Guess we had better luck than whoever that was, huh?
neutral|Well done. I'm very pleased to be rid of that man.
neutral|I can take off my medicine and do some thinking. People say it's real interesting. I don't know, because I never hear it.
neutral|Wow, I didn't think it would be this easy. I should have done this years ago. Guess I'll be going then.
anger|Very well. What job did you need more information on?
neutral|First time I've ever seen anything like that. Was like you'd done him some huge favor. I've gotta hand it to you.
neutral|I've got your back.
neutral|And there are some important groups farther from the Strip, too, like the Boomers, the Great Khans, and the Brotherhood of Steel!
neutral|Thanks.
surprise|Must've been one huge metal Bighorner that crapped that chip out.
neutral|Looks like prisoners are in charge now.
neutral|Give your report to the Elder, then have the doc look your over. Oh, and welcome back.
neutral|Thanks for the assistance taking out Motor-Runner. I'll be heading back to McCarran. I'll put in a good word for you.
neutral|This isn't the Republic. Oddly enough, Legion's a little more forgiving about... friendships. Out here, it's not as accepted.
neutral|Hanlon, exhausted after a lifetime of service to the NCR, stepped down from his position in the rangers and retired to his ranch in Redding.
anger|I can't believe this shit. Time to die, punk!
neutral|There, it's off. Now thing is, a slave collar seems a little too basic for the Brotherhood.
neutral|One belongs to the NCR, the other to a band of slavers known as Caesar's Legion. I was sure the NCR would quickly win, but that has not happened.
neutral|<makes beeping sounds>
neutral|Revitalized by Violetta's brain, Rex eventually learned to balance the memories of his old life with Violetta's experiences among the brutal Fiends.
neutral|I mean, Benny was always scheming about how he was going to get into the Lucky 38, but you already took care of that. Wow!
neutral|Just as long as you keep making waves, that is. Be seeing you.
neutral|Yes, I know the loss of the patrols has weighed heavily on his mind for some time. He took it very personally when they first went missing.
neutral|This little show of force accomplishes nothing. So take your toy soldiers and go home. Show's over.
neutral|Yes, as the highest ranking nightkin alive, my voice speaks for all nightkin everywhere, ever.
neutral|I was a sheriff, believe it or not, for a small town far to the west of here.
neutral|You're weird. Please stop that.
neutral|Give this to the Elder. My observations are all within. Perhaps he will have a better idea of what this situation portends.
neutral|Hmm?
neutral|What you did not know is that these are the Securitrons' secondary weapons.
neutral|You are free to leave.
neutral|Sure, I know him. What do you want with him?
surprise|Oh, well... now, you'll have to excuse me. The general and I don't always see eye to eye on things.
neutral|Only one thing I learned about that asshole. He keeps a bunch of Brahmins. Most of them he roasts whenever he feels like it, but there's one...
neutral|Elder Elijah was nowhere to be found, so McNamara took charge and led what remained of us on a counter-offensive west.
neutral|Hurry! We've got to get some before they notice us!
neutral|Nevertheless, it removed all doubt from her mind that in leaving them she had made the right choice.
neutral|What? are you serious? I've got to see that!
neutral|If you've got a mind to loot the old H&H Tools factory, don't even bother. That place is sealed tighter than a Radscorpion's bunghole.
neutral|Maybe you could go and talk to them... convince them to see things our way.
neutral|Though Novac was a low-priority target for the Legion, many of Novac's citizens died in its defense.
sadness|I left everything when I left Mexico: my home, my family, my name - even my face. I know it's surprising, boss, but I wasn't always this handsome.
neutral|We'll leave a few of them in that footlocker in the corner every so often. The Paladins scoff at using recycled ammo, so no one should mind.
neutral|People used to come here to learn about him, to dress like him, move like him. To be him. If that's not worship, I don't know what is.
anger|A plan by Vulpes... treachery is a weapon that one should never rely on.
neutral|I'll have a much bigger problem once his friends show up. There's no way I could handle all of them in a gunfight.
neutral|But I like to think I keep the memory alive.
joy|Oh, it's cool, kitty cat, I got your back.
neutral|It's never had a functional diagnostic scanning module. Without that, it's useless for surgery.
neutral|Good, getting tired of questions from you when I should be getting answers. Bring her here.
neutral|I guess I can trust you. What would you like to know?
neutral|Just that Benny didn't like them! He talked on and on about how they couldn't be trusted! And this is coming from Benny!
neutral|No, far safer to simply eliminate him and the risk he represents now. Besides, with him gone, New Vegas will truly be ours once the dust settles.
neutral|Due to the Courier's intervention, Chief Hanlon abandoned his plan to sabotage the defense of Hoover Dam.
neutral|I reckon I'll stick around awhile, patrol for troublemakers, see if I can get that radio working.
surprise|Oh. Oh!
neutral|Well, of course there used to be a lot more of them, but these days there are three open to the public: The Tops, the Ultra-Luxe, and Gomorrah.
neutral|Y-Yes. Well, it's, ah, nice to see you, too, Veronica.
anger|I am. If NCR took the same stand and committed patrols to the roads, then I think that'd solve a lot of their problems right there.
anger|I'm sure you've got a lot of ideas, boss, but how about if you let me make this decision?
neutral|Any time the White Glove Society is mentioned in the same breath, it sullies our good name.
joy|Prettiest thing you ever saw, boss. Maybe it was just a trick of my senile brain, but I swear she looked just like my Rafaela. Her name was Claudia.
neutral|Female, Neutral Karma.
neutral|Who's this snake that put bullets in your head? Did he have cause, or...?
neutral|Hmm, maybe I should write something about how much the Great Khans suck.
anger|He abdicates responsibility to a myth of historical inevitability. But he's not Caesar. This isn't Rome. And he isn't going to get away with this.
joy|All right. Just leave him outside the tent when you return. If he cures my condition, I'll see to it that your reward is several times his value.
neutral|Where to begin? That they are weak, and we are strong? This much was known already.
neutral|Makes no difference to me. I'd be happy to see any one of them dead. Who will it be?
neutral|Simple. I'm going to make myself some easy money. I got a plan.
anger|There are many towns, many slaves... ripe for the taking as the tribes from the East were.
neutral|His actions are a beacon to all of us who stand here today in tribute to his valor.
neutral|I've been trying to get that damn thing working for days, and you think you fixed it in a few minutes? Let me see that.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|All out of ammunition.
anger|It's too late for that, baby. This decision you gotta make is going down now. So what's it gonna be?
neutral|It's not something you can teach, but he tried with me. Some of it stuck.
neutral|It's inappropriate for anyone in First Recon to behave that way. I could discipline her, but I'd rather she get medical help.
neutral|Nope. Different fella. Bigger. Had himself a face on a screen, and he talked more like you or me.
anger|Who am I kidding. There's nothing left, and I wouldn't be here, drinking in some shitty bar in the ass end of nowhere if it wasn't true.
sadness|Look, not meaning to fly off the handle like that.
neutral|"Maybe" doesn't do much to convince me. No, just leave me out of this, all right?
neutral|Thank you. I'll get it back to you as soon as I can with the upgraded weapons systems.
neutral|I'll be. Let me take a look at that.
neutral|You'll be meeting face-to-face with the mighty Caesar himself, founder of the Legion, conquerer of 86 tribes.
neutral|Soon after, they negotiated terms to annex The Strip, Freeside, and many surrounding communities.
neutral|I'm not some blind, flag-saluting do-as-they-will NCR lover. They're family, but let me tell you what family means.
neutral|Trapped him? Where?
neutral|Well, I shouldn't have come within a mile of here. I know that. These poor people.
surprise|You arrive on the Strip and waltz into the Lucky 38 like someone left you a key under the doormat?
neutral|Hold up there, that looks like Enclave tech. Take that over to Knight Lorenzo if you get a moment, he may be able to get some information out of it.
anger|Great Khans! Drive Caesar's dog out of our camp! If he's too slow to flee, kill him!
anger|Uh... probably not. Until things settle down around here, alleviating my boredom isn't a good motive to leave. Sorry.
joy|Gloria was right about you. You take care of business before it's a problem.
neutral|You should talk to Lieutenant Hayes. He's in a tent down the road. Just stay on the west side of the overpass if you don't want to get shot.
disgust|Used to say it could sing, but I figured he was on a Jet rush.
anger|I can't comprehend how Caesar could so extensively scramble your sense of morality to make you think the Legion is a better alternative to anything.
neutral|Not the worst I ever been with, but more a pervert than most.
disgust|So you seek quarter? Terms of surrender?
neutral|And every time I ask about it, they tell me the place was empty. I'm just saying... it didn't look empty to me.
neutral|Sure you can, friend, but everyone needs a hand from time to time. Maybe you'll return the favor one day.
neutral|Done.
neutral|You asked for it, punk!
neutral|Been shooting with her so long... couldn't bring myself to toss her away. Would have felt guilty to part with the old girl.
neutral|Let's be straight, baby: there's lucky and there's *too* lucky. You keep up like this and you're gonna break the bank.
neutral|Really? I mean, that's great! I knew you could do it all along. I'll get right to work installing these.
anger|Grandma needs another weapon, pumpkin!
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|Done.
neutral|This place reminds me the Old World had too much time on its hands.
neutral|The Correctional Facility became another abandoned ruin in the wasteland, its carcass occasionally picked over by enterprising prospectors.
joy|Set an example, others will follow.
neutral|Lastly, you will be allowed to come and go as you please. You've done so much for us that to do otherwise would be a crime.
neutral|Oh, now, there goes the pain.
anger|You speak in circles - what of the East? I am the East, and I will prove it this day.
neutral|He said he saw a fella with a daisy suit come through with some of them Great Khan misfits. They was talking about a chip.
sadness|No idea. Maybe... head back West? Though the idea of heading back there with my tail between my legs isn't appealing.
anger|I can deal with them dancing in the fountain, I can deal with them running a Brahmin down The Strip.
neutral|No. This is something for me to deal with. But I'm glad you're here.
neutral|Sorry about that, Utobitha! Here's some music!
neutral|Oh man, Gloria's going to be pissed when she hears about this. Still, he started it, so we probably won't go to war with the Kings.
neutral|And now, without further ado, your prize - The Legend of the Star...
neutral|People aren't going to believe me if you go on another spree and claim the Devil made you do it.
neutral|Here - a souvenir for you. It's Benny's lighter. Shove it up his ass when you catch up with him.
anger|No, boss. No they didn't.
neutral|Though NCR was withdrawing from the region, Boone remained in New Vegas, finding work as a security guard and caravan scout along the highways.
anger|Then they know nothing of me or the Legion's subjugation of the East.
neutral|Unable to clear his mind of the past, he was at last granted the death he'd awaited, bringing final rest to a life that had ended long ago.
joy|Be a nice turnabout from your friend, House, and all the bottlecapping he's been doing to NCR for years. Sounds sweet to me.
neutral|We do what we want, just like everybody else. We just have more guys, so other people tend to do what we want, too.
anger|Stop thinking so much. Thanks.
joy|Still, I'm guessing I got some of Dad's love of whiskey in me, because the burn suits me fine.
neutral|If I or one of the others hears that you're topside, we might just come out and have a little chat.
anger|Then be quick about it.
neutral|That's them. Dumb-dumbs... ah... that is... they...
neutral|You... you did? That's pretty amazing - I figured you'd need artillery to take her out.
anger|That was his decision to make, not yours.
sadness|All they know is that their money gets sucked away to this desert and their brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters die here.
neutral|Indeed you did. And they seem to be in excellent condition.
neutral|It sounds like they've run into overwhelming resistance, and supplies just aren't reaching them.
neutral|You done everything you could, youngster. It's over for Primm. Ain't nothing to be done about it.
neutral|See ya.
neutral|No one by that name has come here, I'm afraid. You must've heard wrong. You can ask around if you'd like - they'll all tell you the same thing.
disgust|Fucking PreWar RobCo pieces of shit...
surprise|I wasn't going to say anything, but when you walked in here I thought you were a ghoul. We better get to work on this quick.
neutral|Done.
neutral|I wouldn't want the Brotherhood or the Followers or the Vegas families running the Mojave, all of them are a different kind of fuck-up.
neutral|Yeah, well, it looks like it might be too late for the Fiends. But we got the message loud and clear.
joy|If that's really what you're trying to do, I'll go with you.
neutral|I've also gotten my hands on a working Stealth Boy Mark II prototype, but that experiment is riskier. I'd rather not pursue that research just yet.
neutral|You really want to talk to somebody, try 10 of Spades. He's always got plenty to say.
neutral|I sure do, but loose lips sink ships.
neutral|All right, I can chat you up, but it is going to cost you. I'm not risking my reputation around here for nothing.
sadness|You could tell she was thinking about it ever since they arrived.
disgust|It only happened once. I chalk it up to sleep deprivation and one atomic cocktail too many.
disgust|Let me see that... "filthy savages? Probably have to decimate the lot of them?" Are these the words of our "friend," Caesar?
sadness|Sure am. Burned for the last time, and this time, it's for good. Worse, it's not done kicking me - I'm still trapped here.
surprise|You're the chief now. What do we do?
neutral|Now all I need is the thrust control modules and three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
neutral|This is nothing compared to what's waiting for you up in the penthouse.
neutral|'Course, seems a lot less remote since you showed up. Plus I haven't been able to get my radio working, and a safehouse's no good without one.
neutral|With brutal methods that few in NCR would approve of, it was the Courier who secured NCR's victory at Hoover Dam.
neutral|Here are the caps I promised you.  Make sure to let Contreras know the extra guns and ammo will be in the next shipment.
neutral|Maybe you can tell me what the hell is going on here. These stony face bastards haven't said a word other than to say they're here under orders.
neutral|It turns out there's only one way for us to win this battle and make it stick! We have to render Hoover Dam inoperable!
neutral|5... 4... 3... 2... 1!
neutral|You could've succeeded!
neutral|Heard NCR drove the Khans out of here, to Red Rock.
anger|I was saying that I'd planned to ask you to forge an alliance with them, but you killed their leaders.
neutral|Janet is free to leave, but she forfeits the wages she's owed. That's the price of contract breaking - take it or leave it.
neutral|'Benny'? Fancy-pant's name is Benny? No, but I reckon that 'Bunny' hopped his way back to New Vegas.
anger|Look, I know you're riding high right now, but let me tell you - you ain't pissing on me right now, you're pissing on the Bear.
neutral|If you're here to redeem your Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars, dump 'em into the slot in the barrel below and I'll count 'em up.
neutral|Mr. House afforded her every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38, both out of gratitude and a quiet pride in his choice of lieutenants.
neutral|Sign says you go south... just look for the rollercoaster. Oh and don't go north, a caravan just got sacked up the road.
neutral|Oh, that old thing? That's a holotape from the last time I visited my grandkids. Such sweet little children, you know. Little angels.
neutral|Flush with his victory, Mr. House sent Securitrons into Freeside, thinking to increase his control over the area.
neutral|Good, I've got more work than time to do it.
surprise|The LT t-t-told you about that? Shit. Man, that's sh-sh-shit.
neutral|Most people think it's cause she doesn't want to start an all-out war with us, but that ain't it at all. She's still got it bad for me.
disgust|He did, huh? Well, good luck with that. You'd have an easier time teaching radroaches to march in formation.
neutral|They sent him to look into the Dam. There was a time when I'd have begged to follow. Watch him at work.
sadness|I'm sorry, you've done so much good stuff for us here in Primm, but we just can't afford to lose any more money to you.
neutral|By my hat, you're flush with Stars, ain't you? Scratch up a few more and the prize's yours.
neutral|Black Mountain Radio continued to broadcast its peculiar form of propaganda. Raul Tejada faced his execution each day, though pardoned in the end.
neutral|That'll have to do. I'd recommend going to see Ramos first. As head of security, he's more familiar with our protocols than anyone else here.
neutral|Why should you trust the Elder? I'd recommend listening to both of us, and choosing whom to trust for yourself.
neutral|Done. Running slideshow now.
neutral|Hmmm... there's still power, but the casing is cracked. I'm astonished that exposure to the stealth radiation could induce mutations so rapidly.
joy|Gift from my Dad, along with my name. Rose of Sharon Cassidy.
joy|Back to Freeside it is. I need to make a stop before I settle in. I'll be back in a while. Thanks again for your help. It means a lot to me.
anger|I charged into the middle of their camp and started firing - two of them were dead before they knew I was there. The other five, though....
disgust|The Caravan fighting here in the Mojave... it's been downright brutal. The amount of caravan space you reserve for ammo alone...
neutral|What do you want to know?
neutral|Can't help you, then. Medical supplies aren't cheap, you know.
fear|Run! Beasts got free!
neutral|With Caesar and a new legate here, the Legion's not going to fall for the same old bag of tricks.
neutral|I never put much thought into the well-being my clients got out of my services. I suppose they only get as much as I put into it.
neutral|I'll roll over to the Lucky 38 and see what I can do. If I'm right about the Platinum Chip, I should be able to install myself on House's mainframe!
neutral|Vault 21 hopes to service your needs in the future. Goodbye.
neutral|You bear the Mark of Caesar. That makes you special.
neutral|The Boomers settled at the old air base northeast of Vegas many years ago. No one knows exactly how long it's been.
neutral|Not "ha ha" funny, you moron. Funny as in suspicious. He's not trying to run away like most people.
neutral|Well shit, feel free to stick a knife in the old ego. I thought I'd made a name for myself around here.
neutral|The Burned Man proved dangerous, unpredictable, and impossible to kill. He helped Caesar form the Legion but almost led it to destruction.
neutral|What'd you have in mind?
neutral|Good. It will be valuable to have allies on the Strip when Hoover Dam is taken. Now, as for your next assignment...
neutral|There is a NCR camp down on the southern border of Nevada. Camp Mojave I think, try to find someone of authority there.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|So you help them at the Dam only to screw them over big time later? All right, I'll go along with this, then. I hope I don't regret it.
neutral|I have a good feeling about this! It's going to be great!
neutral|Independent again, Primm operates much as it had before the Powder Gangs arrived: full of ups and downs.
neutral|Eventually, the NCR got around to putting the prisoners down, but not until they had wreaked havoc on nearby trade routes.
anger|Caesar's laws aren't nice, and their actions aren't always pretty. But then, neither am I, but you keep me around.
neutral|We're back with Best Friend Tabitha, who was telling us why humans should STAY THE HELL AWAY, ier, keep their distance from the State of Utobitha.
neutral|It's a travesty, is what it is. Every second we sit on our hands down here is another second that we're not fulfilling our sworn duty.
neutral|No, the only way I have out of this is if you help me find that gun. You'll help me, right?
neutral|I took a few of the bandits down before I ran, so I figure their friends are out for revenge.
neutral|
neutral|Sending more troops, yes, to reinforce the Outpost, no. Troops head through here on their way to McCarran or to the frontlines at Forlorn Hope.
neutral|The Courier, a mercenary at heart, helped the Legion achieve victory at Hoover Dam.
neutral|
neutral|Done.
neutral|I'll do my best to live up to my last performance.
joy|Great. Glad we're on the same page.
neutral|Talk to Pete if you're so curious.
neutral|occasional nosebleeds,
surprise|I don't have the supplies for a real repair job, but I can do some routine maintenance to keep your gear working longer.
anger|Hey boss, is my jaw still attached? Good. Can I get some help to keep it that way?
neutral|Fair enough. All right, last question - What animal is on the NCR's flag - a two-headed bear, an eagle, a two-headed snake, or a two-tailed lion?
disgust|Of course, no one really will now that he's dead. Good thing, too, no idea what that contraption was on his pecker.
neutral|The Stealth Boys we use have cumulative, adverse effects on our minds. Jacobstown was supposed to be a sanctuary, a place to find a cure.
sadness|Sometimes the Republic gets lost along the way while it's trying to follow its instincts... but when soldiers like you come along...
anger|I was a fool to listen to you... you know nothing of who I am.
neutral|So, what brings you here?
neutral|
neutral|Ever look down the Dam? Sends your head spinning.
joy|You're a poet of understatement, boss. But there were moments it was almost worth it. I still remember finding that novelty costume shop.
neutral|It's not like I'm the only kid in the wasteland who's grown up without a dad. Johnson always said my father was a good man.
neutral|There's some caravans that deal with the Legion, yes. And as much as it pains me to say it, any caravan marked by the Legion is safe as houses.
neutral|Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
neutral|Due process has its place, but sometimes it's just a waste of time. I'll need to know that I'm not going to end up right back in prison.
neutral|The note was sealed with blue wax in the shape of a star. Opening it, the man found it contained a recipe for a sarsaparilla-flavored drink.
neutral|Oh god. He... I guess he was lost a long time ago. Even at the end...
joy|In fact, that's such a shitty job, those caravan families will be the one bottlecapping you to death inch by inch - and that sounds good to me.
joy|If you ask me, that's better than withering away all alone, or holding on to some faded piece of glory from your past.
anger|Rangers are volunteers. Every man and woman who signs up is willing to die for the NCR, myself included.
joy|I'm joking, of course. I will deflect personal questions at any opportunity.
neutral|Aw, shucks, SYSTEM RUNTIME ERROR! Unable to initialize Law Enforcement Protocols, pardner!
neutral|I really shouldn't be doing this for you, but there's no way we're going to use all of this or be able to carry it with us.
neutral|I thought I'd briefly talk about first generation Super Mutants, Rhonda.
neutral|What's the word with the Boomers? Have you talked with them yet?
neutral|But she'll die if you don't help!
neutral|You're either brave or crazy. Either way, I don't care.
neutral|Pretty nice, huh? But that's not all!
neutral|I understand. No hard feelings, but you will, of course, keep our conversation on the matter strictly confidential.
neutral|Thanks for the help. We'll find our own way out.
neutral|I know you've already been out there, but could you do me a solid and confirm these reports with the Rangers who sent them in?
neutral|He has an operative planted in this very base, but does he use his agent to rescue me? No.
neutral|I was hoping I wouldn't have to wait another 11 months to see his crooked ass to get my caps back. Ah well, anything I can get you?
neutral|Trying to defend HELIOS was a blunder of the worst kind, and many brothers lost their lives because of it.
neutral|What'll fight on Blue?
neutral|Uh, no. Implants, not plants. They're little machines I can put inside you to make you faster, quicker, or smarter. I recommend the smarter implant.
neutral|What'll fight on Blue?
neutral|Well, he single-handedly sent in his Securitrons to do it, but that counts in my book.
anger|Seriously, though, watch it.
joy|Hey, as long as you're not asking me to go back to Black Mountain, I'm a happy old man.
anger|Leo broke another weapon! I told you you hit too hard, Leo!
anger|Didn't grandma tell you it's good to share, sweetheart? Especially ammo?
sadness|If you want some tall tales about hunting down slavers or busting up gangs, talk to one of the younger rangers.
neutral|As much as Mortimer and some of the other members have tried to convince me otherwise, I will not have us seen as savages.
surprise|Pine trees?
neutral|It's okay, though. I get a few more k-k-kills under my belt, he'll move me up to Jack. Jack of Spades. Sounds better, right?
joy|You spread word of the massacre of Nipton, just like Vulpes asked you.
neutral|Done.
neutral|That way at least I remember their faces.
neutral|Hope NCR wipes Caesar off the map.
anger|Young punks looking to prove themselves would come looking for me, but my eyes were sharp and my guns were quick.
neutral|If I hadn't switched over, I'd end my trip with nothing but glass bottles rattling on the back of the Brahmin.
neutral|You're free to enjoy the shows and the bar, but no more games for you at The Tops. Thanks for playing.
neutral|You're platinum, pussycat! You know how to swing!
neutral|joint inflammation,
neutral|Bye.
neutral|I've been thinking about it since you brought it up earlier. 500 caps would go a long way for some soldier's families.
neutral|Don't think everyone around here is going to tolerate your actions, outsider. A few of us have a mind to put you down like the animal you are.
neutral|Those few people in a position to countermand my orders only care about results, and in that regard I never leave them less than pleased.
neutral|HELIOS was the worst goddamned action I've seen in a long, long career of fighting.
neutral|Take down this password, it'll get you into the Overseer's area upstairs I think.
neutral|To my knowledge, this is the first time Caesar has ever summoned one of the Dissolute to see him. That it'd be a woman is even more surprising.
anger|But if I get killed, and if there's an afterlife, I'll haunt your ass.
neutral|Let's just say they'll be a little distracted for a while.
neutral|More importantly, this explains why my research into this group of Nightstalkers hasn't come up with a cure for the Nightkin.
neutral|Give this to the Elder. My observations are all within. Perhaps he will have a better idea of what this situation portends.
neutral|Empty.
disgust|I don't see anything wrong with you.
anger|I just wish Caesar would kick the heads of NCR, not the feet. I've fucked a soldier in my time - they don't need to get fucked by their orders.
neutral|Download Complete. Begin Recording.
neutral|Travelers continued to stop by Goodsprings Source for water on the Long 15, but rarely would anyone venture into the ruins of Goodsprings itself.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|Not all Followers are "people persons." Besides, someone needs to do research. I have no problem with Julie sticking me back here.
neutral|When fighting broke out, the Kings fought valiantly, but were no match for the armored killing machines, and were wiped out to the last man.
neutral|It has a stark beauty, doesn't it? I'm glad you can appreciate it.
neutral|
neutral|Okay, first question. Who was the most popular president in NCR history, Kimball, Tibbett, Tandi, or Peterson?
anger|So straighten out, stop being so shifty and... downright mean, and see if that doesn't change your outlook.
anger|And he no longer needed the Followers, NCR, or anyone else. He decided he could remake the tribes of the southwest, whether they wanted it or not.
neutral|Uh, you know, just filling up water and stuff.
neutral|Didn't look like nothing to me. Draw!
neutral|While everyone does own a gun, we could stand to be a little better equipped. The general store probably has what we need in stock.
neutral|If you've been inside the Lucky 38 before, I bet you can get in again! And that's amazing!
neutral|Time was essential for my mission, but we waited three days for him to dispatch us. Another of his headaches. Does that sound like a man in command?
neutral|I'm always running low on xander root. Plenty of broc flowers, though.
anger|Either grandma needs to cut back on grandpa's special moonshine, or she's been poisoned.
neutral|But you'll learn all there is to know in due time. Legatus Lanius, Monster of the East, will soon arrive to command Caesar's troops in battle.
neutral|No... ruined everything... exposed... germs... a year of... life, if... at most...
neutral|So, Best Friend Tabitha, who will we learn about today?
fear|Word is that the Legion's old timers have shown up, Caesar's veterans from the Red Okie Centuria and what was the Painted Rock tribe.
neutral|It's a motive for what happened up North, someone went cruising through both compounds, killed them all.
anger|You rely too much on the trappings of... civilization. The people of the West were once tribes - they will relearn their ways, or...
joy|Chief Hanlon, a nemesis of my Legion, died the humiliating death he deserved.
disgust|Barking up the wrong bar stool, kid.
neutral|Yeah, that's right. Now, get the fuck out of our sight, before we change our minds.
sadness|If the NCR can take full control of Freeside and the Strip, it's going to get worse before it gets better.
neutral|Easy Pete's pretty protective of his dynamite. You'd have to convince him you know a thing or two about explosives before he handed it over.
neutral|Though the Wasteland became anarchic after Hoover Dam, the Boomers' display of power dissuaded fortune seekers from attempting to penetrate Nellis.
neutral|Here's a print-out with some additional information.
joy|NCR's friendly, might be able to resupply.
neutral|Well listen, I can definitely help you find him, but I've got problems of my own.
neutral|All we ask is members and those seeking aid do their best to help those in need when the opportunity arises.
neutral|Then handle them with dispatch. The Legion's assault is imminent.
anger|No way is he getting away with this. I'm not letting it happen. You're not letting it happen.
neutral|Sure. I can help you out.
neutral|I doubt I'll be able to get Stanton to go with me again, though. I thought he'd enjoy it as much as I did, but he was just scared the whole time.
neutral|We can't let people go on believing the Brotherhood has lost its teeth.
neutral|If I or one of the others hears that you're topside, we might just come out and have a little chat.
neutral|Our scouts have reported that the NCR's President Kimball will be visiting the Dam. This is an excellent opportunity to assassinate him.
neutral|All right, you let your caps do the talking. How much exactly are you looking for the locals to forget?
neutral|Moreno, Johnson, Henry, and I will be the boots on the ground. Whitman will stay with the vertibird.
neutral|Return when you've gathered all of their reports.
neutral|And if McNamara should give you any tasks, I'd ask that you kept me abreast of them.
anger|What did you just say to me? Cause you sure as hell got my attention now.
surprise|Oh. Sorry. "There is nothing new under the sun."
neutral|Here's where it gets interesting! Turns out those are our secondary weapons!
neutral|Just my parents, but they haven't been around for a long time. Dad was a Paladin, Mom was a Scribe.
fear|Then gather those items together and hurry back to perform the operation. I don't know how long I've got.
anger|He's Caesar reincarnated, the NCR is the corrupt Roman senate. I wouldn't be surprised if he thought the Colorado River were the new Rubicon.
sadness|How should I put it? I guess you could say she was kinda like a cactus flower. Real pretty to look at, but there was just no getting close to her.
anger|Should kill all these slavers.
neutral|Okay! You know where to go. See you soon!
anger|Sure, their hatred of the NCR would seem to qualify them for use as proxies. But then what do you do with them? Each paladin is quite powerful.
neutral|
neutral|Despite NCR's pledge to support Primm, they abandon the town after their loss to Caesar.
neutral|General Oliver will try to make good on his threats, and he'll find support among citizens outraged by Kimball's assassination...
neutral|Navarro outpost scientists, I am glad that ED-E has reached you. You will find several databanks of information on this machine.
neutral|I swore not to say a word to no one, but an NCR deserter passed through some days ago and traded for supplies.
anger|We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
neutral|Now why would I do that? You see some powder gangers on the approach or something?
neutral|Good question! My function is to monitor Mr. House's data network and decode his encrypted transmissions!
neutral|Talking? Seriously? Sorry pal, but nothing is more persuasive than bullets and bombs, and we're the experts!
neutral|NCR enacted strict trade laws with little resistance, strengthening their supply lines and their position in the Mojave.
neutral|Save your excuses.
neutral|Legatus Lanius, Monster of the East! Quite a man, if man he be.
neutral|Sorry, ma'am. All that thinking has made my head hurt. I don't think I'll be doing any thinking for a long time.
neutral|I stopped being Moreno's officer a long time ago. Everyone here respects me, but they don't need to follow my orders. Not anymore.
neutral|That's when all our Securitrons will show up! We'll declare an Independent Vegas, and tell the side that won the dam - to scram!
anger|Yo, I'll tell you what this squad needs. A healthy dose of angry juice.
neutral|Criminal scum that've infested this region, attacking caravans and regular folk just passing through.
anger|Still, Caesar was impressed enough to conscript us, use our skills with dogs to join the Legion as houndmasters.
joy|Now on the other hand, if I had a Stealth Boy and a Bobby Pin, I could see myself out. Know what I mean?
neutral|That's not the worst injury I've seen - hell, it's not even the worst this week. I think we can patch you up.
neutral|My mother taught me never to say something 'less it was nice. So I don't have nothing to say about Primm, for the time being at least.
neutral|Oh, I remember now! I was playing hide and seek in the big hangar! Mister Loyal made us leave though.
anger|Then get yourself back there, and get it done.
neutral|Yeah, was a stupid idea, anyway. See you around.
neutral|I've been hanging around hoping to ambush some of them, but haven't had any success.
disgust|I'm sorry to say that it was. Civilian casualties was acceptable and sometimes... encouraged. My former squadmate Moreno didn't need encouraging.
neutral|Yup, but this is getting a might embarrassing - people are going to start to talk. <laughs>
neutral|Hmm?
neutral|Take this override module - it's just like the one you used at the El Dorado Substation.
neutral|<pant! pant!>
anger|"The Free Economic Zone of New Vegas..." What the hell does that mean?! Oh, wait, here we go.
anger|The West's treatment of bitches such as you is their weakness. But... by my honor, I shall face you alone, as you request.
neutral|The Stealth Boys we use have cumulative, adverse effects on our minds. But, thanks to you, it seems a cure is on the way at last.
neutral|Can do.
neutral|
neutral|Instead, the two sides maintained a long stalemate, and after some time fighting broke out and both sides were mysteriously wiped out.
neutral|Good. I'll have my men seize him immediately.
neutral|Head Scribe Taggart quickly realized my extraordinary talent when I took the mandatory VR combat testing.
neutral|Guess that's as good a reason as any to quit this stinkin' trade. No glory. No easy money, no women, and no glory.
anger|Don't care much for which one we kill first, whether settling accounts with McLafferty or making that bitch Gloria eat her hair.
neutral|But... we got it, now what? Sure, this damns them, but only if someone listens.
neutral|He's done right by the tribe many times over. Tell Jack this girl is free to enter, but he is responsible for her actions.
neutral|Wow, you sound like Elder McNamara. I know I should. Hell, it's what I signed up for when I chose to stay into adulthood.
joy|She owes us a favor. Go talk to her, she'll be able to point you in the right direction.
neutral|Though a cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia was eventually found, it became a case of too little, too late for Jacobstown.
neutral|There you are! A few of us wanted to thank you for being such a good friend to the Brotherhood, so we've set aside some of our recycled energy cells.
neutral|Can't say I've heard the name. Or heard about any man dressed like a seat cover.
neutral|That's not going to cut it anymore. You've become a pain in the ass around here. Double that or we're going to box your ears.
neutral|Aside from this place, there's the Atomic Wrangler just up the street. Women, gambling, booze, you name it, they got you covered.
neutral|What am I wearing? Cardboard?
neutral|Here, take this holotape - it goes into more specifics about the rules. You'll also need a deck, so take one of my spares.
neutral|Still, you raise a fair point. My Securitrons can handle this. When the Legion attacks Hoover Dam, I'll be waiting for the Omertas.
neutral|Well... the logical thing to do is to check with the patrol rangers and comm officers. Don't be too discouraged if some things don't match up.
neutral|You're asking for leniency from us? Are you crazy?! We show up when the talking's over, get it?
neutral|That's why Benny put me here! To monitor Mr. House's data transmissions. They're all encrypted, of course - but I'm quite a decrypter!
neutral|I've been trying to get the Elder to send out scouts for years, and he's always been resistant to the idea. Said they'd be a vulnerability.
neutral|Too bad. No caps, no key.
neutral|Let's see what you've got.
neutral|Yeah, the docs say he's going to be laid up for a while, assuming he doesn't get any worse.
neutral|Cook-Cook loves using his flamethrower on his victims, usually after he rapes them. Little Buster can tell you more about him than I can, though.
neutral|After Hoover Dam, Sheriff Meyers runs Primm with his own style of frontier justice.
neutral|That's not usually a request we agree to. Typically, we take in the young, so that they might be trained through adolescence.
neutral|He sure didn't. Benny was pretty tight-lipped and cryptic about the thing, but he did let me poke around in it for a while.
neutral|We are preparing to move against the Dam, and Legate Lanius has a part for you to play in the battle. Report to him at his camp.
neutral|I do know basic first aid, but I've had to rely on tribal remedies to treat illnesses and injuries - healing powders and all that.
neutral|He even insisted we set up our base there, against the objection of nearly every paladin. What followed is a whole other story.
surprise|Perhaps it is unfortunate Vulpes was not here to hear your words... something tells me you would prove more than his match.
neutral|Done.
joy|That's great! I can't believe you went through all this trouble for me. Thank you!
neutral|With this, I can finally have him removed as Elder, and end this ridiculous lockdown.
neutral|Mick and Ralph sell all sorts of things at a small store over by the east gate. They've done all right by us, and they'll do all right by you.
joy|Here you go.
neutral|Sounds like a man I'd like to meet.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|The device that creates the sandstorms above, that masks our comings and goings, was only intended to be used in case of emergencies.
surprise|You're not kidding. You're in bad shape, friend. I'd be happy to fix you up... for a reasonable fee.
neutral|Done. Running slideshow now.
neutral|We made a good team. I hope we can work together again in the future.
joy|Meeting Corporal Sterling, well... it kind of got me thinking.
neutral|That's it, really. There was nothing glorious about the battle, just a nightmare of screams, blood, and death.
neutral|Right. Fine then, last question -  What animal is on the NCR's flag - a two-headed bear, an eagle, a two-headed snake, or a two-tailed lion?
neutral|You did? That's... that's an unusual approach!
anger|Change of plan - you'll find that I've sealed the doors to this hangar - I don't want my friends getting involved in our little disagreement.
neutral|Accident or no, we both now find ourselves in an uncomfortable situation.
neutral|Oh, I've already heard. Pacer is dead. The Kings are up in arms. The entire area is gripped by chaos and the violence has only increased.
disgust|And how battles are lost... when you bring nothing but words to a contest of strength.
neutral|No. Couldn't bring myself to leave everyone else behind. Couldn't convince her to stay, either.
anger|Piece. Of. Shit.
neutral|The Kings refused, and briefly became slaves in the Legion, but after failed escape attempt, they were all put to death.
neutral|I've heard stories of that old guy. I'm amazed he's still alive with how much he's been through.
joy|Thank you, this will keep us well-stocked for a good long while.
neutral|I hear you've actually been inside Lucky 38? You're the first person who's been in there in as long as anybody can remember.
neutral|This is Lorenzo, a Knight with the Brotherhood of Steel. We'd be very interested in examining your tech.
neutral|You've broken the rules of The Thorn, you've dishonored this sacred ground! I don't tolerate such offenses.
neutral|If you'd like to see the NCR include protection of Primm in its duties, then you'll have to get some more troops up here.
neutral|My terms are the same. A pardon from the NCR and the freedom to do the job anyway I see fit.
sadness|I left Mexico City behind. I made my way out to the Gulf Coast, eventually I found an old Petro-Chico refinery nobody had claimed.
neutral|Every night around midnight Alice and I'll wake up to some crazy hollering and gun shots. You'd think the world was ending all over again.
surprise|Et tu, mi amica?
neutral|And to start the reactor itself requires a tremendous jolt of current. Very attention-getting.
neutral|Better we all die than allow the technology we have here to fall into such unworthy hands.
neutral|We'll make sure whatever information we find is used for the greater good - and who knows, I may be able to give it some kind of upgrade for you.
anger|These bones are about to give up the ghost, boss.
neutral|In the relative peace that followed, Brotherhood patrols appeared along major roads, harassing travelers over any bits of technology they had.
neutral|And now they are lost forever, denied the salvation and healing glow of the Far Beyond...
disgust|Any invasion by a democracy is a half-measure. When Kimball dies, the NCR will recoil from the Mojave, and from his legacy.
neutral|Nightkin suffer schizophrenia from the Stealth Boys they're always using. One of the reasons I settled Jacobstown was so they could be cured.
neutral|
neutral|Yes, you exploited his fear of Powder Gangers very effectively. The collar includes a microphone, you see. Part of the test.
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|The NCR had it up and running at 50% capacity within a year of occupying the dam. By treaty, New Vegas receives 5% of its output - more than enough.
neutral|By the time any of us realized there were civilians down there - women and children - the shooting had already started.
neutral|Poor bastards.
neutral|Who am I to argue with a solution like that?
neutral|You can guess which camp her parents belonged to.
neutral|Tabitha and Rhonda went east, through Caesar's land. Occasionally tales of their exploits found their way back west, though few believed them.
neutral|All right. Moore's not gonna like it. But that's for Crocker to worry about.
neutral|Freedom? I don't know where we'll get a new start, but any place is better than rotting with the legion or Frank.
neutral|Maude is what you might call the discount rack. She's what a customer wears if he doesn't have the caps to afford Sweetie - or just likes them old.
neutral|This is the Lucky 38 Resort and Casino - or, it used to be. Mr. House has kept the place locked up tight for ages now, nobody comes in or out.
neutral|And while they're not important in the overall scheme of things, there's Mick and Ralph, too. Just don't tell them I said that.
neutral|Instead, we wait and wait. I'm sick of waiting.
neutral|For a pittance, the great Vulpes Inculta inveigled this town to lead those it had sheltered into a trap.
fear|It's a gamble either way. Even with Caesar gone, we still might not outlast the Legion. I suppose that's a risk I'll have to take.
neutral|Damn! And he looks good to me, too.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|Each spot for a land mine is numbered, hear tell.
anger|Before that happens, I want Mr. House knocked out of the game, a quick one-two punch - with you doing the punching.
sadness|What I felt in that struggle, I felt as I saw the map of the West. The West is a trap. The bear has already been caught in it, and it is dying.
neutral|With its logs cleared and its systems upgraded ED-E  remained a vigilant and constant companion to the courier.
neutral|
neutral|Yeah, quit it with the crazy talk.
anger|Didn't even leave a scar.
neutral|You're the luckiest player I've ever seen. Keep up the good work in here.
neutral|Were you even listening when I said what you're supposed to do?
neutral|How strange! Why would anyone leave the safety and comfort that Utobitha provides?
joy|I've kept in contact with them over the years, so I know where you can find them, but I doubt they'll open up to you unless I come along.
neutral|And there's a town just east of here called Nelson. Used to be such a quaint little place until those slavers took it over.
neutral|I'll tell you what I told Hardin. There have only been a few cases of Elders being dismissed from their posts in the Brotherhood's history.
neutral|Didn't take you for the toughest courier in the West when you walked in, but you walked all the way to the Outpost, so at least you have guts.
neutral|Elijah could look at an old device and immediately understand what made it work. And he could see its potential. Where it fit with other technology.
disgust|They're all so mired in procedure and paper out there, the kind of evidence we gave is going to be worse than shooting them.
neutral|You do? Why, that's just wonderful! I'll take it and put it with the rest of the collection.
neutral|Okay then. You should know the rules. Just stay out of trouble, and have fun.
neutral|That night, Cass kicked in the door of his room to celebrate, only to find the man on the bed was an NCR soldier whose barracks had been destroyed.
neutral|They'll be handled with the utmost security in our bank.
neutral|Let me take a look. Really? That's it? You've got a few scrapes and a hangnail. Come back when you're really hurt.
neutral|All other personnel are forbidden to leave, and any personnel that were out there when the lockdown was enacted are forbidden from returning.
fear|Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
neutral|Oh my God, are you okay? You've gotta get to a medic. Doc Kemp can patch you up back at base.
disgust|That's a complicated question. They've done horrible things to our people to be sure, and I've gladly killed many of their soldiers in battle.
neutral|It just gets worse the further north you go... Deathclaws... death in general. But it's your ass, I suppose.
neutral|Mind yourself on the plank going down.
neutral|Know that I shall return East. I shall not remain there forever. On that day, the strength of the bear shall be tested.
neutral|Now that's over with, I'd send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope, but I heard it's overrun by the Legion. Bastards.
fear|I should've known that Mr. House wouldn't have sent just anybody. Anything I might I offer to, well, encourage discretion?
neutral|What Marco said is true. The Legion attacked my village when I was 16.
anger|Am I selling? Yeah. Am I selling to you? No. Sorry to hurt your feelings, but you're small time. Move along.
neutral|Yay, that's great news! You finished what Mr. House and the NCR started! That's got to feel good!
neutral|nausea,
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
sadness|I mean, you can't... help bad people, who want to hurt the locals in Freeside. If you do, I'll leave. Does that make sense?
neutral|Yes, I know. It was detected immediately and deactivated... let's see... 39.735 seconds after you planted it.
neutral|We Frumentarii are soldiers of a different stripe, capable in battle, but skilled as infiltrators and agents as well.
neutral|Me, I like having big walls between myself and the wasteland.
neutral|Thanks, I'll spin up some tales of you slaying some nasty critters infesting some of the local homes and donating the leftovers to charity.
neutral|Anyway, go on and head up top, ask her what's going on, if you haven't already. I don't much give a shit.
neutral|No disrespect intended, but you aren't the first person to dream up the idea.
sadness|We may have over extended ourselves by setting up camp in Freeside, but the people here need help from someone. If not us, who?
neutral|This is the only place to cross the Colorado safely.
joy|Color me impressed.
neutral|The problem is that a distributed image of my neuro-computational matrix is backed-up to the network several times a day, or when I'm threatened!
neutral|Well... this is payback for at least one of my troopers. She'll be glad to know he's dead. Here's your caps.
neutral|Maybe being a doctor in the middle of Nevada wasn't exactly what he had in mind for his little boy.
neutral|I was thinking of taking a walk a little later.
surprise|And where is this Arcade?
neutral|You can search the Vaults, but every Auto-Doc my Legion has run across has been stripped for parts long before we found it.
neutral|In that case, I'm sorry. Our program is only for citizens of the NCR.
neutral|That place was hardly defensible, and we knew the NCR was moving in on us, but the Elder refused to budge, insisting that he just needed "more time".
neutral|But after he had locked the doors, he turned around to find an unfamiliar bottle on the bar, with a note beneath it.
neutral|Vault 21's previous manager is no longer capable of servicing your needs. Hotel arrangement functions are now purview of Mr. House.
neutral|Then you give me no choice.
neutral|Fuck, no. If I knew where this bitch was, do you think I'd be asking you?
neutral|It's hard work, so when I'm not working I like to relax. Which means it's time for you to fuck off.
neutral|When Mr. House asserted control over Outer Vegas, his Securitrons eradicated the remaining Fiends entirely.
neutral|Place always wants me to take a piss.
neutral|You're free to leave. The guard in the weather station will return the Chip to you when you're ready for Caesar's mission.
neutral|Yeah, what else you going to do with an empty bottle? Wait for it to refill itself?
neutral|No, I'm afraid. Johnson truly hates the Legion.
neutral|But I'm only sticking around as long as you're in Freeside. You leave, and you'll find me gone as well.
anger|Fine, I will, jackass.
joy|That's okay, I'll fix him! Can I have him now?
neutral|The Platinum Chip is the key to overriding and exploiting Mr. House's defenses!
anger|Don't take that as anything more than my words. I bet you're a real sweetheart the way you leave that trail of broken-hearts behind you.
neutral|His father worked as a caravan guard on the Short Loop, and his mother, like many Californians, braved the ruins of the Old World as a prospector.
neutral|Due to the Courier's intervention, Chief Hanlon abandoned his plan to sabotage the defense of Hoover Dam.
neutral|I've picked up some unusual chatter regarding your robot. It seems that it has some information that we could use. Oh wait, where are my manners?
sadness|Yeah, it beats dying alone in the Wasteland because you were too slow.
neutral|He ensured the fall of Mr. House and the end of the Legion's and NCR's influence over New Vegas.
fear|Watch out - easy to get sick around here.
neutral|Unfortunately, he rarely acts. The Kings believe that everyone in Freeside can do whatever they want, provided they can back it up with force.
neutral|I'm not required to answer questions from a civilian and I don't trust you enough.
neutral|I hope you've been practicing your drills, Veronica. It's dangerous outside.
neutral|The Legion occupied all major locations, enslaving much of the population and peacefully lording over the rest.
anger|You don't see the others crying about every little bruise and scrape, do you?
neutral|Prefer settling things with my fists, though. Made more friends than corpses in bar fights - plan on keeping it that way.
neutral|Well, I knew he was going to get rid of me. So I kicked him where it counts and I ran. And then swam. And ran some more. Wound up here.
neutral|That's a hell of a thing to say. Build up a man's hopes, then dash them in front of him.
neutral|She had removed Mr. House from power over the Strip and broken the influence of the NCR and Caesar's Legion in the Mojave Wasteland.
neutral|It's just at the top of the ridge here...
neutral|And we're holding Hoover Dam, but Caesar's Legion is positioning itself to overrun it. If it falls, so will New Vegas. We'd be forced to withdraw.
neutral|I suggest talking to those NCR troopers across the bridge. I also overheard the Powder Gangsters talking about some ex-sheriff on lockdown there.
neutral|Even if that were the case, we still need more incentive to help Vegas.
neutral|Please, enjoy your stay.
joy|But I shall give you the time you need to prepare.
neutral|Well, thanks for telling me. I know that knowledge didn't come without risk.
anger|You almost convinced me otherwise... but justice comes to all in time, and it now comes to you.
neutral|Any other objections or questions?
neutral|
disgust|So he robbed you? Robbing a courier's low, and any family or group he's with is going to get a black eye for it.
neutral|There's certainly a lot we could learn from your technological expertise.
neutral|
neutral|There's a human down the path. Tabitha's orders are to kill all human intruders. Go!
neutral|They're the best of the best and the baddest of the bad. Short of a centurion or praetorian, they don't come any tougher.
neutral|Because he's looking to avoid a bloodbath. I get it. He knows me.
neutral|Come now, don't keep me waiting.
neutral|<happy bark!>
neutral|When you find terminals with those messages, lock them down and move on. Find three of them before the virus jumps, and we'll wipe the damn thing.
neutral|Of course I have. Many times, in fact. The Elder has an open door policy, and will listen to advice on any subject, save this one.
neutral|That makes sense, and it's still more than these troopers see in a month.
joy|Can't keep the courier spirit down, eh? Fair enough. We'll clean up here.
neutral|Upon reaching Navarro ED-E vanished and was not see in the wastes again.
neutral|As I said before, Martina Groesback is a useful, if unwitting, source of information. The Omertas want her dead, while I need her alive.
neutral|They're a family-run business from out west that deal in weapons mostly. A word of caution, though. They're not a friendly bunch. Not at all.
neutral|No clue. I know Benny hadn't paid up yet. Maybe that was where they were supposed to get square.
neutral|Male, Good Karma.
neutral|Not much to tell. We're a bunch of guys that just want to do our own thing, and anyone who's got a problem with that can shove it.
neutral|Not much, just killed a bunch of people. Maybe a couple of kids, too. Whatever.
disgust|Just shitting you with the NCR line, done wonders for morale around here. President Kimball keeps saying getting shot at is its own damn reward.
neutral|I've got him on guard duty patrolling the tarmac just inside the south gate. And I reassigned the other guard, so he should be alone.
neutral|Back to Old Mormon Fort, where I can do some good. We Followers may be idealistic but even I know this is going to end in blood.
neutral|
neutral|So they settled at Bitter Springs, but they kept being so obnoxious, the NCR had to kill a whole bunch more of them!
neutral|Done.
neutral|Guess that settles that, then.
neutral|I hope they do, but I haven't heard nothing.
anger|Whew.
neutral|We'll... we'll pay you. Whatever we got, you can have it. We'll put together a collection every couple of days.
neutral|It's all about quantity over quality. Trouble is, you'll be cleaning and fixing your gun a lot more than usual when you use those kind of bullets.
neutral|How could you just sacrifice your body like that? You never even met him. If the NCR doesn't have a medal for this, they should make one up.
neutral|Great. As long as you're in Freeside, I'll be hanging out by side. It'll be a blast.
sadness|We all gotta go sometime, but I was hoping for something a little more heroic.
surprise|They must have extraordinary vision. Some of my scouts were targeted at extreme distances.
neutral|We'll leave a few of them in that footlocker in the corner every so often. The Paladins scoff at using recycled ammo, so no one should mind.
neutral|Bold, as it pleases The Thorn, and me. But it does take more than that to earn my admiration.
neutral|Though Camp Golf fell to Caesar, the Misfits distinguished themselves during the Legion's attack.
neutral|Now I know you're from the NCR! None of the vagrants around here would even think of giving their money away.
neutral|Here - a souvenir for you. It's Benny's lighter. Shove it up his ass when you catch up with him.
neutral|A Brotherhood base? Here? Are you shitting me? No one's seen them for years.
neutral|My guess is that it has a reader that can decode the chip, and who knows what else? Maybe a giant robot or something!
neutral|With its logs cleared and its systems upgraded ED-E is discovered by a traveling caravan, who take him on as a protector as they wander the wastes.
fear|It can't be! How the hell...
neutral|Done.
neutral|The best place to start would be with Ralph at Mick & Ralph's over on the east end of Freeside. Other than that, your guess is as good as mine.
neutral|If you're gear's in need of repair, HQ's also worth checking out - talk to Major Knight, he can help. Provided you got a pen and plenty of ink.
neutral|I've picked up some unusual chatter regarding your robot. It seems that it has some information that we could use. Oh wait, where are my manners?
anger|Lottery? You remember the lottery?
neutral|Legate Lanius has not chosen anyone to be his second yet. It would be an honor to be selected, though.
neutral|Done.
neutral|And after the blood dries in the sun, he'll melt that piece of Jet-induced sculpture down, and reshape it into a bull.
neutral|Friend or not, no one is allowed in here. Move along!
neutral|I hope someone helps my girl before it's too late.
joy|If she'd had better food or hospitality, she'd let you hear it. Trouble was, she usually had.
neutral|
anger|I am not another Legate, and I am not such a fool as Graham, to be painted in pitch and set aflame.
neutral|Thank you. I strongly suspect that the source of the mutation is artificial, but the Super Mutants found nothing. Your fresh eyes may do better.
fear|Well, good luck to you in your future endeavors, assuming they don't involve Caesar.
neutral|I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse. We are much more liberal about the sharing of technology than those Brotherhood... People.
neutral|So I did. As you may have noticed, our position here in New Vegas is tenuous.
neutral|He went north with some of the other guys. Didn't say where, didn't say why. All I know is he's got some kind of score to settle with the NCR.
joy|All right, then. Hopefully I've got something to wet your whistle.
neutral|Thanks. Wasn't wild about sticking around here on my own.
neutral|Well, crops aren't doing so well. I'm thinking it might be something in the water.
neutral|Hey, look over there! It's those Mojave rats again, coming to take our water!
neutral|You're asking me to accept a bribe. I'd like to make sure the risk to my career - and freedom - benefits the families of my troops.
neutral|The creator has promised to my flock a new land: a place of safety and healing... a paradise in the Far Beyond.
joy|Benny's theory, if I understood it through all the screaming, was that Mr. House stashed some kind of ultimate weapon down there.
joy|I'd pay very close attention to what she has to say, as well as any official papers she hands over for your perusal.
neutral|A vengeful spirit, some of the more superstitious women claim. He was a great leader of the Legion before he failed Caesar.
neutral|What do you need, then?
neutral|So shall I have him seized or not?
neutral|They said they'd be heading through Nipton to Novac to meet a contact there.
neutral|I'll switch over all radio broadcasts to the new encrypted channels - this ought to help us stay a step ahead of any spies.
anger|I wasn't the best-behaved kid. I was quick with my hands, with a pistol or a wrench, and I wasn't afraid to get into fights over it.
neutral|As one of our patrols discovered, the mutants just to the northeast have become strangely violent in the years we were secluded.
neutral|Westside wouldn't be what it is without Anderson helping us out, so I cut him a deal on his rent.
neutral|Doesn't matter to me what you do. As long as the ghouls are out of there, that's good enough for me.
neutral|Elijah was a strange one. His even becoming Elder was highly questionable, seeing as how he was a Scribe. Typically, only Paladins are eligible.
joy|Good work on that, by the way. Hope you got good bounties out of it.
neutral|This Fiend named Cook-Cook on account of the flamethrower he wears? He had his way with Sarah, every way it can be done.
neutral|A silver tongue would help. Convincing Trudy that we had a good plan to win the fight would also help.
neutral|Gonna be hard covering you when I can't move my legs.
neutral|They had planted an NCR flag over the well and they would not budge until every last one of them was laid out, dead and cold.
neutral|NCR taxes and inflation have been hard for a lot of people to deal with, and most of the money is going to the war effort.
neutral|Naw, I'm just happy to see my pup back on his feet and happy. I can't thank you enough for this.
neutral|Sounds good to me.
neutral|That's why I was helping out with the research into Mr. House's technology. Trying to, anyway.
neutral|Moore's got her hands full right now, and she's not a subtle person in the best of times. Her solution would be quick and dirty.
neutral|Ain't gonna see me up on a cross or my head on no pole, uh uh! That's for loooooosers!
neutral|I need other people's thoughts to fill my head when I'm not thinking myself. Otherwise it's... kind of empty.
neutral|I've seen a lot of folks come through here thinking they'll have the easy life once they get there. It never happens.
neutral|Thank you. There's no telling what would happen if everyone were to suddenly find out, but I trust it wouldn't be good.
sadness|Uh... oh yeah, I didn't tell you about the first time. I'd rather not talk about it, if you don't mind.
neutral|
neutral|After their bold arrival at Hoover Dam, the Remnants disappeared as quickly as they came.
neutral|I don't mind fighting - especially to protect you, dearie - but I don't like guns. Give me a good chopper, and Leo and I will go right to work!
sadness|Might just be the whiskey talking, but I think I might feel a whole lot better leaving the caravan business behind me...
neutral|No kidding! He was running fast! He better pace himself - he has to run all the way to Fortification Hill!
neutral|Well, problem is that's left us with enough Securitrons to drive off a weakened NCR force - probably - but not enough to keep them from coming back!
neutral|Now we can actually start fresh. Thank you for helping us.
neutral|Not too much, lot of caravans going nowhere. Lot of troopers going nowhere, too.
neutral|Mr. House ran projections on how the NCR public will react to a defeat at Hoover Dam! Overwhelmingly, they'll blame Kimball!
neutral|You said it. With these threads, people are finally going to start noticing me.
sadness|I don't think she meant it. She really was a sweet girl.
neutral|Our left arm contains an X-25 gatling laser, quite deadly against soft targets at medium range. That looks like fun!
neutral|It's still against regulations, I can't help you.
neutral|Yes - the herd.
neutral|The Baja rangers can do more advance night scouting and sharpshooting to assist the troopers.
neutral|Sure. Here's what I've got.
neutral|No idea. Maybe catch the sun in their eyes? Maybe they wanted the caravan to come to them, walk into an ambush?
neutral|Guess I was a little too obvious. I'm actually a bounty hunter - I was hoping to bag some Powder Gangers if they tried to rob me.
neutral|beneath the flag of the New California Republic, dedicated to Old World values of democracy and the rule of law.
anger|And to send you to deceive me... it is you that they have tricked, not I.
neutral|Oh man, I am so screwed! Look, if you change your mind, I'd really appreciate it.
neutral|Very well.
neutral|Yeah, a lot more. Back when we were at the HELIOS station. Er, crap.
disgust|There was a tell-all in El Periodico de las Aburridas by a starlet House dated. She said they never, um... don't make me spell it out, boss.
anger|Still, the city was full of looters, already forming into the beginnings of raider tribes. Crime was bad before the War, but now it was a nightmare.
neutral|NCR patrols do a good job of keeping the highway clear, but I'd keep your gun where you can reach it easily. You never know who you'll run into.
neutral|No problem. Hey, do me a favor when you get back to Reyes and tell her that we don't need any more damn ammo. Wouldn't mind more water, though.
joy|Look, there's something I have to do, but I promise I'll be back in a while. Trust me. And thanks again for your help. It means a lot to me.
neutral|Staying low.
joy|The monorail that the Profligates rode from McCarran to the Strip has been destroyed.
neutral|It was all biometric data, life signs from Mr. House. The technology he's using is so advanced that it samples data hundreds of times per second.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|Hnh. My coming would have saved you, set your people free in ways they cannot see.
neutral|equal respect, representation, and protection under the laws of a just republic.
neutral|Due to the Courier's intervention, Chief Hanlon abandoned his plan to sabotage the defense of Hoover Dam.
neutral|I could use some assistance, sure, but I highly doubt you have the technical background to help us deal with this virus.
joy|I never was happier than when I was in the cockpit. I was able to go just about anywhere and everywhere, limited only by the fuel I could carry.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|Oh, I very much doubt that. What fun would it be if everyone could have it?
neutral|I don't want to say delusional, but I don't know what else to call it. The only thing familiar about it was the signature.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|You'll need to locate it on three different terminals in this area in one minute. Any longer and it'll jump, and you'll have to start all over.
neutral|I've heard stories of that old guy. I'm amazed he's still alive with how much he's been through.
neutral|Gracious me, I lost control a bit there!
neutral|Julie represents the Followers of the Apocalypse. They're a group that tries to help people out whenever they can, so we get along just fine.
surprise|Questions, boss? You mean you don't know everything there is to know already?
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|This is pretty bad, but I've seen worse. Still, it's going to cost 75 caps to get you back on your feet.
neutral|I knew you'd be reasonable. Now... how did you find me? Did the officer send you?
neutral|Such a curious little munchkin, aren't you? What do you want to know?
sadness|I'm... I'm not sure. What was I saying? That's right, the Brotherhood...
neutral|Done.
neutral|Better believe it. Everybody, everybody in Caesar's Legion from Caesar on down will kill themselves before they can be captured.
neutral|<Brothers! Attack!>
neutral|Well, keep it away from me, won't have anything to do with it.
neutral|I suppose you're right. When you're part of something for that long, maybe it's impossible to let go without losing part of yourself.
neutral|Isn't it exciting? I always wondered why I had missiles in my shoulders but couldn't launch them. Not that I'd ever want to!
neutral|Khans lost their strength after Bitter Springs, came here to lick their wounds.
neutral|Get ready, honey. I'm going to make it good for you.
neutral|Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though.
neutral|Yes, dearie?
neutral|I go to grab him out of there and I notice he's holding something in his hand. Something metal.
neutral|Look like you've walked a ways, so if you need to shake the dust off, head to the Barracks, the bar's there. Not much, but better than nothing.
neutral|Antony said he was punishing me for trying to hide it from the Legion.
anger|I'm not going to throw away the lives of my men just to make a point. And there'll be other days.
neutral|The less who are aware of this situation, the better. My brothers and sisters were deeply traumatized by the losses we incurred several years ago.
disgust|Ah, Bison Steve, you old shithole.
neutral|Trouble with rustlers? Count me in, pardner. Those varmints will be running home with their tails between their legs soon enough.
neutral|Men and women stepped forward to say, "I will carry the weight."
neutral|It's kind of a long one, but all right. About twenty, twenty-five years ago, a group of NCR settlers pushed way south into Baja.
neutral|My flock fought bravely, and killed a few, but at such cost. Nearly half of us died or went missing.
neutral|Your guess's as good as mine. Probably better.
neutral|Word will probably spread about this, and quickly. The NCR'll know not to come around these parts if they know what's good for 'em.
surprise|By Steel, I haven't seen wounds like these since HELIOS. I've got to get you treated quickly.
neutral|There, I've stowed all of your weapons. You're clear to enter. When you leave, I'll hand them all back to you.
neutral|Not a problem. Just some scrapes here and there.
neutral|I never stood a chance.
neutral|He liked to learn limits, too, but only so he could push them.
neutral|She left the Brotherhood. Wanted to put some distance between herself and her parents.
anger|That's not going to cut it anymore. You've become a pain in the ass around here. Double that or we're going to box your ears.
joy|You did? Does that mean you're going to help?
neutral|Look around Nellis. We've got a stockpile of weapons, and we've all spent plenty of time at the range.
neutral|You know where to find me.
neutral|It shouldn't take more than a few days, and then we can begin moving forward again.
neutral|
neutral|Are you sure, dearie? Taking my medicine all the time makes me feel woozy, but it does make it easier for me to ignore Leo.
neutral|Travelers venturing too near Black Mountain continue to be harassed by Tabitha's followers.
neutral|Benny didn't like them, though! He said they were "creepy."
neutral|Still, I haven't been exiled yet, or worse, assigned to latrine-cleaning duty. But I will, if you don't help me find that gun.
neutral|Precisely. You'll have no trouble joining the battle on their side, and they'll be too distracted to notice why you're really there.
neutral|Me, I'm here to do my job. For now, that job is shootin' Fiends.
neutral|Sign of the buffalo.
neutral|Goddamn you! I don't need to remember that!
neutral|
surprise|I'm sorry, but is that supposed to be a joke? There's nothing wrong with you. I can tell just by looking.
neutral|You dared come here, after what you did?
neutral|Ouch, this one's got a bite, Simon! Call him off, or he'll get put down.
neutral|No, of course not. I... don't know what I'm going to do now with Rhonda back...
anger|Thanks for nothing, you fink!
neutral|Done.
neutral|The guy you're looking for, Benny, he was traveling with some members from my old gang. They were going to Boulder City.
neutral|Don't go too far now, dearie!
neutral|If you ever get to New Vegas, be sure to visit Gomorrah. It's the best casino in the city. You won't regret it.
neutral|Sorry about the gun. You just caught me off guard, that's all.
neutral|In the end, there was just him and his vision. Nothing and no one else.
neutral|That's a good attitude! I'm sure you'll do fine. These are just a few questions that just about anyone in the NCR would know.
anger|What's wrong with you? This man shot you, stole from you, left you in the desert to die.
neutral|Oh, I don't sell things, mister. I sell thoughts.
neutral|Of course, have they been dealt with?
neutral|If you need something repaired... let me know, I can sign the work order. As long as caps change hands, I can put them back in yours.
anger|They'd shot up the brothel, killed four girls, and taken Claudia for their sport.
neutral|They aren't the toughest legionaries, but they're the most devoted to Caesar. They believe in everything the Legion stands for.
neutral|I could be wrong, but I think that's a dead end. McNamara's always followed orders, and we've been incommunicado since fleeing HELIOS.
neutral|Wait, that's not true. I think the NCR back West, when riled, is going to be the worst enemy the Van Graffs and the Crimson Caravan ever had.
joy|Baby... your generosity and spirit of forgiveness? Off the charts.
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|Novac? Nice enough place I suppose... but between you and me - when I rolled into town my skin started to itch. Watch yourself.
neutral|I'll trust your word, and reward you as though you wreaked this destruction at my behest.
neutral|All right, go on - let's put our cards down.
neutral|That's a dangerous question... asked the way a bandit might ask... but since we're close to town I'll trust your good intentions.
anger|You son of a bitch. You know, I was just going to give you a piece of my mind and now? Now I'm going to put you down.
neutral|I'll use the Substation to send a huge jolt of electricity to the Lucky 38! Turns out this casino has its own reactor! All it needs is a jumpstart!
neutral|No. Those aren't for outsiders to use. Leave them alone.
neutral|<Coughing Fit>
neutral|No freebies, Sugar. Not even for you.
neutral|
neutral|Take care now.
neutral|Hoping to lead the Mojave Brotherhood down a new path, Veronica sought to learn from the thriving cultures of the desert.
sadness|Could have handled that better.
neutral|Yeah - take the Strip down a notch or two, right? That'll show it! Okay!
neutral|What can I say? Business has been good lately. We can afford the help.
neutral|Just hanging out. Same as usual.
neutral|I don't want to be... alarmist or anything, but maybe you should ditch that Eyebot. Robot. Whatever that thing is.
neutral|Such as?
neutral|No need to worry about the General, by the way. He'll be held responsible, publicly disgraced... 36.5% probability of suicide, by my estimate...
neutral|Caesar has forbidden us from ever speaking his true name again, and so we simply refer to him as the Burned Man.
neutral|Damn, it's jumped! I thought we might have had it that time.
neutral|The hell you did. I know enough about electronics to know that what you were doing wasn't fixing it.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
neutral|Yup.
neutral|Well, the Legion is going to attack Hoover Dam one of these days! And the NCR is going to defend it!
neutral|And the Lucky 38 of course, but we're not open to the public. You're a special case, sugar.
surprise|Just how old do you think I am, boss? Because I can pretty much guarantee I'm older than that. Let me tell you a story from before the Great War:
anger|Not looking to have my heart skip its last beat, even if I considered putting that junk in my system, which I don't.
neutral|Be seeing you.
neutral|That was so much fun! The wind whipping through our hair, not knowing what was going to jump out at us at any moment.
neutral|Your injuries aren't too severe. I can patch the scrapes and lacerations pretty easily.
neutral|Oh my stars! Are you sure? If I don't take any medicine at all, Leo gets especially cranky. I can't stop him when he's like that.
neutral|She was presented with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
neutral|Done.
neutral|The soil and the hot, dry environment don't make it easy, but we get by all right.
neutral|All right.
disgust|Well, Hanlon sure let this place go to shit.
neutral|Your chances of breaking through my defenses, they're... minimal, at best!
anger|I decided my guns hadn't gotten me anything, and it was time to give it up. I took off that old vaquero outfit, and put on a Petro-Chico jumpsuit.
neutral|Work around here? Might check with Jackson in the main building. Or Ghost up on the roof above, but watch out, she's... well, she's kind of a bitch.
neutral|We gave you a password, Veronica. It's for your safety.
neutral|You got yourself a bad reputation with us - that's what.
neutral|First, let's go over how to put it on...
neutral|Impressed with the Kings' continued attacks upon NCR citizens and soldiers, the Legion offered them the option of being assimilated into the Legion.
neutral|The Boomers remained isolated but have been seen flying over the Mojave Desert from time to time.
joy|I know I'm not always the most serious guy around, but this means a lot to me. Thanks.
neutral|Guess he wants to do this the hard way, boys. Take him down.
anger|Woman of the West... you will learn your place - in my tent, and again, when you beg for release on the edge of my blade.
neutral|I wouldn't put it exactly like that, friend.
neutral|I guess we can send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope. They need all the help they can get there.
neutral|Why are these stars there, and what do they mean? Nobody knows! Except maybe ol' Festus, hee hee.
neutral|All this is, is a slave collar. Seen plenty of these infernal contraptions in my day, and I know just how to spring 'em. Hold still.
neutral|See you around.
neutral|
neutral|Jesus Christ!
disgust|Wanted to be with someone who knew how to please a woman, that's what.
neutral|Some of the girls say he's been involved in some shady business the Family wouldn't really like. Ask him about it.
neutral|I respect the way you've conducted yourself around here. Reminds me of myself in some ways.
neutral|Oh. Well, it's a big hotel. You should talk to Marjorie - she's in charge and she can probably help you find anyone you might need.
anger|Let me get to my chair.
neutral|Yes and no. The Blackfoots don't exist anymore, just like any other tribe that gets swallowed by the Legion.
neutral|Take a look.
neutral|<growl>
neutral|It's not any closer than the first, so if you'd rather let be, let me know.
neutral|Fine.
neutral|All of us are trained in combat and farming from a very early age. When we reach adulthood, we serve in whatever capacity we are best suited.
neutral|The fine proprietors of Mick & Ralph's appreciate that kind of attitude, and would like to offer you a discount on their fine wares.
neutral|We clean up, take prisoners, watch the East for any more trouble from the Legion... though I think they're still running, according to our scouts.
neutral|I'm guessing that was you. If so, you're not leaving this outpost except in chains.
sadness|My parents, my grandmother, my two brothers and two of my sisters all died.
neutral|What I meant is, you should get to know these tribes and decide which ones you like and which you don't!
neutral|We've recently started making our own stimpaks, but we just don't have the materials to make other meds. Sorry about the lack of selection.
neutral|Three such teams have gone missing recently, and the news of their disappearance has not yet been widely spread to avoid undue concern.
fear|Those dogs look like they could savage a Securitron.
neutral|
surprise|I honestly didn't expect you to say that. When I talked to you about Daisy and the others, you seemed to put a lot of value in loyalty to the past.
neutral|Should you continue dealing with the Elder and find yourself beginning to see my point of view, I'll be around.
neutral|They're protecting their own. Just happens to help us.
joy|That's what I like to hear.
neutral|And I suppose you're taking credit for the deed, fiend! I will avenge her!
neutral|Oh, so you're talking about one of them packages. That job had strange written all over it. But we couldn't turn down the caps.
neutral|Might make him careless, too.
neutral|No, we have more specialized issues we need help with right now.
anger|I know I shouldn't place one life below another, but in Caesar's case, I'll make an exception.
neutral|Okay.
neutral|We'd love to, but they don't fall under NCR jurisdiction. Even if they did we're in no shape to protect them.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|And there you have it, Utobitha. The next time you play with a huggable, loveable centaur, remember that Best Friend Tabitha made it all possible.
neutral|I didn't want to get Mr. Anderson in trouble. He says the Westside needs to be able to take care of itself.
neutral|Got myself a habit of looking all around - not just where I'd expect to find trouble. Old habit, but it's saved my hide, on occasion.
neutral|And when those scorpions came out! It was just like the sims! All I had to do was line then up and squeeze the trigger.
neutral|All this traveling's making me thirsty.
neutral|Oh, here's a final tip - don't ever follow anyone into a dark alley in Freeside. Later, chump.
neutral|He's more sympathetic to the locals than Moore, but he's got the Fiends to deal with.
fear|I said I don't know anything. Leave me alone!
anger|I am, but they're still my family. I think you were right the first time. If there's something I can do to help hold the dam, I'll do it.
neutral|Hardin. Er, Elder. I know why we're failing.
neutral|We have some personnel that are allowed to travel on the surface. They trade for what we need, and occasionally drop off what they acquire.
neutral|You've got three days to improve your reputation with the NCR or we come for you... without all of this pleasant conversation.
fear|Oh, all right. I'm thirty-ish. Well, late thirties. I was born... west of here. I was an only child and spent most of my time with my mother.
surprise|You forget about me already, boss? You sure you didn't take a blow to the head or something?
neutral|The people who are most likely to know how it could be done are also some of McNamara's strongest supporters, so they refuse to help me.
neutral|Now wait a minute - Republic's a sight better than... other alternatives. Women are serving here, after all. The rest... well, might take some time.
neutral|Good. We'll still need a plan before we rush the town. I don't want to embarrass myself and get beat by a bunch of townies.
neutral|Stop him!
neutral|Not looking forward to being a Legion wife.
anger|Instead of trying to learn from the past, he re-creates it, runs back over the same old barren ground.
neutral|I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to talk about that, especially with outsiders, so forget you just heard that, okay?
fear|I know I been bad, but it's cruel to jerk me around like this...
neutral|
neutral|Should have heard stories of the Khans years ago - they were one tough bunch, now...
neutral|No... Should I be?
neutral|Nipton was a wicked place, debased and corrupt. It served all comers, so long as they paid.
neutral|It's not that clear cut. You have to understand, Graham was the toughest son of a gun anyone around these parts had ever seen.
neutral|Disillusioned with the Followers of the Apocalypse, he settled down in the outskirts of the Boneyard, where he worked happily as a family doctor.
neutral|Fine, then, you want to play rough? We'll play rough!
neutral|Hmph. That's better.
neutral|Nothing, man.
neutral|The only time anyone gets to go topside is guard duty. Or to gather provisions. Other than that, it's steel walls and fluorescent lights for us.
neutral|Whatever those reasons may be, you've jeopardized the success of this entire concern.
neutral|An alliance? That's an interesting proposition - any plan where I can throw packs of raiders at the enemy instead of my own soldiers is a good one.
anger|We'll talk about the Platinum Chip when the time comes. In the meantime...
neutral|Now that the Lucky 38's reactor is fired up, Vegas doesn't need the dam to have power! Vegas is energy-independent! Whoo-hoo!
anger|Fine, I'm going, I'm going. And I'll take my business elsewhere!
disgust|You're a veritable guyser of curiosity, boss.
neutral|Interesting. Okay, next question - what was the original name of the NCR capital - The Boneyard, Shady Sands, Aradesh, or Vault 13?
neutral|You just going to let everyone in without checking them? Bad move, rookie. That's going in my report.
neutral|In the aftermath that followed in the NCR, bitter citizens and opportunistic senators were quick to denounce President Kimball and General Oliver.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
surprise|Bitter-Root actually said that? I can't see him talking about his problems to anybody, much less admitting that someone else actually helped him.
neutral|Exactly how many civilians did you want to die in that crossfire?
neutral|
neutral|I always wondered about that. First Recon is elite, but the rangers... I can't imagine what it'd be like to lose that kind of status.
anger|Just putting this out there, boss: if these Super mutants kidnap us and force us to fix toasters for them, it's on you.
neutral|That's right! Like I said, it's probably pretty important because it has non-standard hardware, just like the Lucky 38!
neutral|Vale.
neutral|Done.
neutral|From what I understand, they're perfectly delightful! They're cultured, clean, and super-polite!
neutral|Depends on who you're looking for.
anger|Just when I think I'd seen it all.
neutral|I imagine the NCR would be able to bring some law to the town, too. But from what I seen they barely got the firepower to protect themselves.
neutral|I heard some badass wastelander killed the Deathclaws, and deliveries of limestone have been coming in again.
sadness|Look, I appreciate that you're trying to be friendly, but I'd just rather not discuss it.
neutral|Yes, we've already started receiving telemetry from it. This will be a great help in our future efforts, and I thank you.
neutral|The loss of morale in the NCR must have been staggering when their leader fell. It's proof that no one is out of the Legion's reach.
joy|I can also do maintenance work on your stuff - I don't have the supplies for a real repair job, but I can keep your gear working longer.
disgust|In the words of Socrates, "Go fornicate yourself."
neutral|Inform me when you are ready to go.
neutral|The rangers assisted the troopers admirably during the Legion's ill-fated attack.
joy|That's it, baby! Time to vacate these premises!
disgust|If you don't have a gun and a will, don't matter much what you do when you reach here, except stare at that fucking monument outside.
neutral|There's only one avenue left for me - I need to run the Mark II test on Lily. It's the only way.
joy|I appreciate the information, but I really wasn't kidding when I said I didn't have the manpower. If you could deal with him, I'd be in your debt.
neutral|Old Mormon Fort expanded its services and was able to aid more people, becoming a refuge for the less fortunate citizens of New Vegas.
joy|Can see Dinky for miles, good landmark.
neutral|Though a few managed to erase their pasts, most never survived the journey.
neutral|Now stop stalling, get out there, and do your fucking job already. Sheesh.
neutral|Done.
joy|Anything you say, boss.
neutral|Who won the second Battle of Hoover Dam?
sadness|We was going to California, but Goodsprings was as far as we got. After she passed, wasn't no reason to keep going.
sadness|I was born just outside Mexico City. My family had a little ranch there.
neutral|Johnson Nash's my name. Husband to Ruby Nash. Lived in Primm going on eight years now, thick and thin.
neutral|Along with all of the crucial data contained within. That'd be like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
neutral|The man, cursing his luck, closed the saloon early that day, just as the sun began to set.
neutral|Not far from this spot, a monument stands as a tribute to the sacrifice made by those who came before us,
neutral|All I can tell you is to find Cachino. He's the lowest level Lieutenant you're going to be able to talk to.
neutral|Pursued by bounty hunters, NCR rangers, and the Brotherhood of Steel, Arcade pushed deep into the eastern plains and was never heard from again.
neutral|But the new entrees are fresh and bold and I have the two of you to thank for it.
neutral|Well, if you can help, I'd appreciate it. Need to get these caravans moving.
neutral|Heard NCR recon fucked up here once, with the Khans.
neutral|Anyway, didn't mean to talk your ear off. Some days... just feel like more requisition forms and daily reports come across my desk than results.
neutral|Can't complain. Not like there's anywhere else to go, right?
neutral|ED-E traveled with the Courier until one of its memory banks was triggered causing it to continue its travels on to Navarro.
joy|Might see some recruitment numbers rise, build some morale out in the Mojave long enough for NCR to find its feet again.
neutral|Sure.
neutral|It's nice to see things going the way they're supposed to, for a change. I'm going to pay you out of my own pocket for this one.
neutral|That such an act could occur so far west is nearly unthinkable. The NCR has forces in all directions, and an outpost scant miles west from here.
neutral|The fact that the Elder has some tasks for you means his faithful won't suspect you, and you have a line open to the man himself.
anger|Even if we're running at one percent for a year, it's still worth holding this place.
neutral|Merciless in their assault on the NCR, the Remnants struck fear into the hearts of even the Centurions at Hoover Dam.
neutral|Not many of them are alive anymore, but I think they could make a difference in the fight against Caesar.
neutral|If the stories are true, he'll be a valuable commodity here at the Wrangler. I appreciate the find.
neutral|Your... vanity project... doomed to fail...
neutral|How do you spell "gesticulate?"
surprise|These boys and girls can really down the bottles.
neutral|Looooong ago, people didn't have a heap of choices when it came to soft drinks. It was either water, or Nuka-cola.
neutral|Dad used to say that in the Old World, people would put boards on their feet and soar down the mountains.
anger|NCR? Are you out of your fucking mind?
neutral|Being posted here is her second and last chance, and so far, I'm not impressed. Lenk's jumpy all the time, and the others are sick of it.
neutral|Ha, you've got yourself a live one here, Simon. Anyway, I've got things to do. Later.
neutral|Best Friend Tabitha reserves the right to turn down applicants for any reason, including whimsy or boredom.
neutral|Dismissed.
neutral|Do you now? If I didn't already owe you a great deal I'd be highly suspicious right now. You'll have to tell me about it sometime.
neutral|Yeah... yeah, that's a good idea. They'll learn that shouldn't have messed with me. Just wait till they get what's coming to them!
neutral|Their organization, so reliant on the wisdom and guidance of its elder members, became a shadow of what it once was to people across the wasteland.
neutral|No... even times being what they are, not sure I'm looking to sell, even for all the whiskey in Reno.
neutral|Now what in the hell do you suppose that was about?
neutral|I don't know where she is now, but I'm sure she's moved on. I still think about her, though. Once in a while.
neutral|I don't care for their incivility or the hodgepodge of sporting equipment that passes for fashion with them.
disgust|Big surprise, right? I should have seen that coming.
neutral|I'll make my way there.
neutral|But I will say this. If all of 'em turned up dead tomorrow, I couldn't see as to how they'd be missed.
neutral|Sure, no problem! So long as the Legion doesn't attack before you can get there! Which I'm sure they won't!
neutral|A cannibalism problem? Really? I'm so glad you weren't eaten!
disgust|If you're looking for action, grab some grease from your hair and give your gun a few pulls.
anger|Need a drink.
sadness|When we reach the place, it's six shacks set up around an old well.
neutral|Please, take this. It is a small token of my thanks, and scarcely begins to repay the debt owed you, but is all I am allowed to give an outsider.
neutral|You know, this time I may actually need a gun with a brain.
neutral|Not even a "drop your weapons and hands up" before the bullets started flying. We put up a good fight, but there was too many of them.
neutral|So this is what the rest of the world looks like!
joy|You've saved me the trouble of coming up with a more permanent solution, and Martina is free to go about her business as usual. Well done.
sadness|<Sad stare>
neutral|Thanks.
neutral|Take a look at this print-out. I may have said things wrong a moment ago.
neutral|All right. 50/50 it is, but you better bring back all of the caps.
neutral|Have you ever heard the story of the bomber that crashed into the lake before the War? Supposedly it's mostly intact, even after all that time.
neutral|Just goes to show you, no matter where you go, there's NCR trying to hold onto every corner of the world.
anger|Nope, not for you. Rumor is you've been working against us, so the deal's off.
neutral|Your guess's as good as mine. Probably better.
neutral|Good. I don't know what kind of security he has inside the Lucky 38, but if you can find a way of catching him off-guard, do so.
neutral|Sure, Caesar's a drag, but as long as we got each other, we don't care who the top dogs roll with.
neutral|If we let our guard down, they might attack. All it takes for the Legion is for them to sense weakness.
fear|Back to the gilded cage.
neutral|Just as long as you keep making waves, that is. Be seeing you.
disgust|Hoover Dam has never seen the massed strength of the East. Only Legates such as Graham... who deserved the fire Caesar blessed him with.
neutral|Thanks. Watch your back out there. Never know when those Legion bastards might show up.
neutral|That must be some kind of code of honor you hold yourself to. You're like a man possessed.
neutral|When atomic fire consumed the earth, those who survived did so in great underground vaults.
neutral|And in the meantime General Oliver won't approve any offensive maneuvers because he doesn't want to risk losing our positions.
neutral|Well, I got a job working as a crier outside of The Tops advertising for the local talent performing at the casino. That didn't last long.
neutral|Ooh, I'm sorry. It looks like you've got some of your facts mixed up. I'm afraid I can't help you.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|It has a stark beauty, doesn't it? I'm glad you can appreciate it.
neutral|Our children are protected from the outside world, but they are not ignorant of the dangers it holds.
neutral|In the weeks that followed, feral ghouls, overflowing from the REPCONN Test Site, ravaged the weakened town.
neutral|I think you should be sure to visit the other families on the Strip, the Omertas and the White Glove Society, so you know what makes them tick!
neutral|The death of the Mojave Brotherhood came much too soon for Veronica, and in their absence, she felt truly lost.
neutral|As you wish.
neutral|I like the way you think. Oratory may indeed be a useful tool in our arsenal if wielded effectively.
sadness|Well, thanks for hoofing it there and back, even if it was bad news. Wish we could spare the troops to go hunting, but... orders are to stay put.
neutral|I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse, and I help the locals in Westside grow crops. Unlike the NCR, the Followers don't expect anything back.
neutral|Hey, that's a great idea! This information might help with our training manuals, and maybe create a few new apprentices for Loyal.
neutral|Plenty of demand for them, seeing as they're one-of-a-kind collectors items. But I might still have some in back.
neutral|Boomers are a might twitchy.
neutral|Could say that's on account of the dust storms. But if there were criminals using these bunkers as hideouts, I'd know.
neutral|Sure can. The NCR was founded from the survivors of one of the great Vaults. We started as a small settlement called Shady Sands.
neutral|I handle communications for Camp Forlorn Hope, compiling reports I've received from the Rangers at Camp Golf as well as the brass at McCarran.
sadness|Maybe... but what if you miss the old days, sometimes?
neutral|If I could stop it from happening, I would! I mean, your vengeance is going to feel so incomplete!
neutral|Look, just leave me out of this, all right?
disgust|This little stunt is probably what got them killed in the first place. Our normal patrol routes are known to be relatively safe.
neutral|He's more sympathetic to the locals than Moore. Now that the Fiends aren't giving him grief, we should see more troopers assigned to the front lines.
neutral|That's not too bad. If that's what it takes to be rid of them...
neutral|Them Powder Gangsters got our deputy locked up in the Bison Steve. Be nice to get him out of there... but this town's gonna need some real law.
neutral|It made everyone afraid of him. Heck, the praetorians burned Graham four years ago and some of the tribes are still afraid of him.
neutral|I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse, we'd love to have the opportunity to examine the technology on that machine.
neutral|I... well, since you ask so nicely, and I'm not sure I could resist those pretty eyes. What do you want to know?
neutral|Now, was there something you wanted to talk about?
neutral|Changed our minds pretty quick after a brief demonstration of how much firepower they're packing.
neutral|And though the price on his head rose to levels unheard of, few pursued it, fearing it would be the last thing they'd never see.
neutral|When the Legion showed up, we fought, most tribes did. Hangdogs hung out longer than most... broke us by throwing our dogs on the fire.
neutral|Physician, heal thyself. Guess it's a good thing they invented stims.
neutral|If the stories are true, he'll be a valuable commodity here at the Wrangler. I appreciate the find.
neutral|Ever seen NCR troops asked to go after gangs at three-to-one odds? That bear flag doesn't make them bulletproof.
anger|One two three four five six seven eight nine ten! One two three four five six seven eight nine ten!
neutral|Do not make me regret this decision, outsider.
neutral|Well, I thought I might set up a safehouse in one of the bunkers here. Between the remote location and the dust storms, I figured it was ideal.
neutral|Well for that your best bet is going to be talking to Deputy Beagle.
neutral|Besides, if I came for the girl, I'm not all friendly and charming like you are. She might get the wrong idea.
neutral|I'd be more than happy to have you. Heck, I'll hire anybody with a pair of legs and at least one good eye at this point.
neutral|I suppose it's all right, if there's no other choice.
anger|NCR's my country, and I support it. Anyone who says otherwise, I'll feed them my knee.
neutral|Done.
disgust|Sure, boss. I'm sure you've got a lot to think about.
neutral|
neutral|That only lasted about a minute before Graham ordered the back ranks to push through to the front and rush the ridge.
neutral|Or so they did, 'til NCR brass finally mustered up enough troops to take out the trash. Wish I could've been there.
joy|Sweet to offer, baby, but if you cut these ropes every Legionary in this camp's gonna come running. With machetes.
neutral|Trouble is the Nightkin don't like being visible, either. They don't take being exposed too well.
neutral|Hmm. Might need some antidote here.
neutral|In short, you're in a perfect position to help me. Will you at least think about it?
neutral|Not sure that's going to mend fences with the folks back West, though. But...
neutral|I just don't see why it's necessary. Now, are you going to let me in or not?
joy|All right. Let's not waste any time. There are people out there to help, things to learn. Maybe not in that order, but let's get to it.
neutral|Though prospectors pick through the remains of the town from time to time, no one re-establishes it as a settlement.
neutral|Don't believe everything you hear. Me and Saint James earn our caps working salvage.
neutral|
anger|This paper of yours? Isn't fit to wipe my ass. If you think after all that's happened, I'm going to grab my ankles and take it like the Legion...
neutral|One of the first things them punks did when they came in was to kill our sheriff. You find us a new one and we can talk.
sadness|Rose of Sharon Cassidy died as her caravan died - in an unmarked grave, another victim of the Mojave.
neutral|NCR further "encouraged" them to leave Outer Vegas entirely, and the Followers had no choice but to comply.
neutral|In the years following the destruction of Cassidy Caravans, NCR used evidence of the plot to blackmail the Crimson Caravan and the Van Graffs.
neutral|But if following in his footsteps for a while means I can do some good out here, I will do my best.
neutral|Forgive my challenge. I'll take you to my Decanus at once.
neutral|Come talk to me when I'm in my store and I'll be glad to do business with you.
neutral|I didn't join the Kings. I helped start the Kings. This whole operation you see here was put together by the King and yours truly.
neutral|Or that there were seven couriers, but six of them were carrying junk? How about their exact routes, and the mercenary teams that screened them?
neutral|Bad trouble.
neutral|What do you make of what you've seen?
neutral|...So now I'm going to have your death on my conscience, too. Great.
neutral|Few children are, especially when they are born during a relatively safe time in our history.
neutral|Now, I suppose I'm going to have to show you how to use it, aren't I?
neutral|Yeah, it's a damn shame. There was a lot of talk about expelling her from the Rangers, especially once the gambling and drinking started.
fear|This shouldn't be too surprising, but I'd prefer you let the Followers examine him. Hopefully the reasons are obvious.
neutral|Supporting the ideals of independence, the Courier was recognized as the man responsible for a truly free New Vegas.
neutral|Yeah, I lived through it. I like it here better.
neutral|There'd be a lot of money in it for you if you can get him back to me safe.
neutral|Indeed you did. And they seem to be in excellent condition.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
neutral|Those snakes? ...for them? ...you sad, misguided... whore.
surprise|Maybe the infestation has been there long enough to keep scavengers out. Why don't you go and see?
neutral|Go all the way down to the Vault's main game room, take the hallway to your left and then the first room on the left-hand side. Enjoy your stay!
neutral|Hey, I know you got no reason to help me now, but you seem really nice. Could I at least tell you about the problem we've got here?
neutral|And if you can't bring her here, you're no use to me - or Gloria. So if you want to cause trouble in here over nothing, then go on - try.
neutral|No, weapon check-in protocol includes verifying the serial number of the weapon, so a different gun would be noticed.
neutral|What the hell for? Just farmers and ranchers out here. Not much worth stealing.
neutral|Them twins run the Atomic Wrangler, the only working casino here in Freeside. It's become pretty much the place to go around these parts.
fear|Hey, I'm one of you! Don't eat me, eat the smoothskin! Oh, uh, sorry boss.
surprise|Huh? Look, man, me and Diane, we don't dig on that politics stuff, savvy? We just make the product and make it get to a good home.
neutral|After a while I made enough money to get a passport into Vegas. Back then you could get approved for entry for a fraction of what it costs now.
surprise|Damn. Never had you pegged for the drill instructor type, but you got my attention.
neutral|Nothing I know of, but if you've come from the North, means you can travel freer than most around here.
anger|They try and put one of those Brahmin packs on me, they're asking for a gelding. Going to get gelded.
disgust|If the Republic put as much effort into protecting the East as they put into those two asinine giants outside, then they'd be worth that monument.
joy|Just a little bit, boss. No, I haven't seen him. Sounds like a city slicker, though. Might try looking on the Strip.
joy|I also bring ammo supplies with me for any rangers who may be running low. If you need any feel free to ask.
neutral|
sadness|It's... a thing. A science thing. It hurts robots. Don't worry about it. Silly Arcade's just telling magnetic field jokes for his own amusement.
neutral|I think if you rough him up enough and really put some fear into him, he'll sing like a choir boy.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
anger|He accepted that, but took the most experienced ones and sent them south. Patrol rangers are good men and women, but we're about to fight a war.
neutral|Wish I'd packed a jacket.
neutral|Told you everything about us, did he? Well, it's been a while since I've had my hands on the controls of a vertibird.
fear|Careful, Boomer territory. They ain't hostile, but they're a bit trigger happy.
anger|I don't think "give" is in Chet's vocabulary. Even with the town at stake, he'd still make you barter with him.
neutral|I want my debt with the Omertas paid off. And I want one of those severance package things. A big one.
neutral|Soon enough we realized that Chris was a gift from the creator. He is integral to the success of the Great Journey.
neutral|We carried the weight, and though we left behind many of our brothers and sisters on that battlefield, it did not break us.
disgust|Smells like Fiends.
neutral|Yeah. I've been taking things apart and putting them back together since before I said my first word.
neutral|I'm speaking figurative, isn't any blood on their damn hands. Course, when Caesar comes walking through here, there'll be blood for real.
neutral|Carry on.
disgust|Watch for NCR vomit.
neutral|Vale.
anger|All right, quit fucking around. You survived and you tracked us down. What now?
neutral|All right, you can go on in. Can't guarantee your safety, though. Just saying.
neutral|The condition being that the stranger would be allowed to sample a bottle whenever he liked, to ensure the recipe was being followed to the letter.
neutral|Right now, Eddie and his boys run the place. They've got the guns and the dynamite, so they call the shots.
neutral|All of the Boomers' accumulated knowledge quickly scattered, and their existence slowly faded from memory.
disgust|I don't see anything wrong with you.
neutral|Though Novac eventually fell to the Legion, many citizens of Novac were able to escape, alive and intact.
neutral|She trusts her life to the newbie, and I sit there and let her get raped by that... p-p-piece of shit.
neutral|Stop back in a few days, and we can speak of this again. Now, I must be off. There is much to do!
neutral|Despite his extreme actions, he was awarded with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
neutral|In the new world of the Mojave wasteland, fighting continued, blood was spilled, and many lived and died - just as they had in the Old World.
surprise|There was some kind of message, but... I don't seem to remember it.
neutral|Oh shit! They saw us. Get out of here, quick!
anger|Then ask them. The battle draws near.
neutral|I'm kind of sorry about this, but I'm going to have to up my price to 100 caps per tip from now on.
neutral|The fine proprietors of Mick & Ralph's appreciate that kind of attitude, and would like to offer you a discount on their fine wares.
neutral|The pump station is pretty run down, you could go take a look around the place, see if you find anything strange going on. What do you say?
neutral|Sure can. Take the road southeast out of town till it hits the freeway. Primm is the town with the roller coaster, straight south. Can't miss it.
neutral|Well, rambler, it's a royal flush that beats all! So let's crown this hand!
neutral|My caravan was on the return trip from California and heading back up to the company branch in New Vegas when we got jumped.
neutral|
neutral|With the NCR driven off? I figure our only hope'd be for someone like you to find us someone who's crazy or dimwitted enough to take the job.
neutral|My guess? Leads to a big cashout at some casino - and if the "38" on it is any indication... well... Lucky 38 it is.
neutral|Hurry! We've got to get some before they notice us!
neutral|We've been hearing stories about Legionaries on the Nevada side of the river, so keep a gun handy. You don't want to get caught by them.
fear|Said he'd return with one of the greatest treasures of the Old World, make the Mojave like it was meant to be... wipe the slate clean.
neutral|Much as I hate the Legion, caravan life would be a hell of a lot easier if they ran the roads.
surprise|Cass lived to see the Courier bring down three armies and by her count, that was three more than she'd expected. She'd kept quiet about that, though.
anger|Do that. And try not to take too long.
neutral|You won't notice anything once the lights are out, hon. The places that count are still firm enough...
disgust|Hell. Can't believe we got suckered by some road jockey. Should've watched the flank while Caesar's best was making all that noise.
joy|You've helped the Followers, so you can't be entirely bad. To be honest, I haven't heard anyone say a negative word about you.
sadness|I guess it reminds me of my own life.
neutral|Don't hurry on my account! I'm the one with the flexible schedule.
joy|Yeah... that air! Smell it!
neutral|I wonder if anything rhymes with "Cazador?"
anger|A leader shouldn't have to kowtow to those who serve him. With so much energy wasted on those below, how is he ever to move forward?
neutral|There you are! A few of us wanted to thank you for being such a good friend to the Brotherhood, so we've set aside some of our recycled energy cells.
neutral|The praetorians covered Graham in pitch, lit him on fire, and down into the Grand Canyon he went.
neutral|Some folks don't believe he's here yet, but you can tell. He's the eye of the storm. It all roils and spins around him.
neutral|Guess the tent belongs to the big man.
disgust|You seek to buy my conviction, like some merchant from the West.
joy|Everybody knew Robert House. He was a genius. A superstar. Founded RobCo at 22, dated Hollywood starlets, the works. They say he saved Las Vegas.
neutral|It will allow us to tap into the radar and other detection systems running there, assuming they're still operational.
neutral|Just let me know what you need.
neutral|You got it! I won't say another word about them!
neutral|Sure. Here's what I've got.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
anger|Interesting that she would wrangle someone else into sorting out the problem.
disgust|Yes, a veritable Pax Romana for post-nuclear America. My political beliefs are a bit more progressive than outright fascism, so I'll pass. Thanks.
anger|The NCR had a chance to use the Followers' skills before, but being imperialists mattered more to them. No thanks.
neutral|It's a sad state of affairs. Discuss it with Mr. Nash if you care to. Just makes me want to cry.
neutral|How many chips would you like?
neutral|The other casinos follow Mr. House's rules, so I guess that makes him the leader of New Vegas. As far as I know, nobody's ever laid eyes on the guy.
neutral|Watch yourself.
neutral|The motel and Dinky the Dinosaur were left vacant, a rare stop at best for travelers along Highway 95.
neutral|'Til our trails cross again, pardner.
neutral|Wow, our stockpiles mostly included full metal jacket. I should start a reloading class for the children to learn how to make ammunition!
neutral|Wow... that's crazy.
neutral|Weapon mods are things like silencers, scopes, bigger magazines.
joy|Until the day when our armies meet again, courier - I shall wait for you on the battlefield.
neutral|Profligate troops, Powder Gangers - or men of the Legion. The people here didn't care. It was a town of whores.
neutral|
neutral|I half expected you to say that. In which case, I'll continue to pursue the matter on my own.
neutral|That wasn't the only reason she stuck out, though. That girl never minced words.
disgust|I have no *need* to hold it - anything the West sends against me shall break against the wall that is the Legion.
neutral|Done.
joy|So I walked up and told them there was a group of raiders coming, one hundred strong. I made up some cockamamie name for them and everything.
neutral|
neutral|We ain't got much in the way of supplies, so if you could shake down the old doctor and the store owner for some stuff, we'd be in good shape.
neutral|This is going to be great! I'm going to help you accomplish so much, whether I want to or not!
disgust|Or are they just collateral damage?
neutral|And your cyber-dog is... where, exactly? I can't perform the operation without him, hopefully for obvious reasons.
neutral|Goodbye.
neutral|Of course, helping Ringo would also make the Powder Gangers mad, and they've got a lot of friends out there.
fear|Holy shit! Run for your lives!
neutral|Yes, we can't let Caesar's death get in the way of the Legion's goals.
neutral|Thank you kindly.
neutral|
neutral|Yes, have you reconsidered? NCR citizens may be dying as we speak in that hellhole.
neutral|<bark!>
anger|Get her!
joy|It's President Kimball who's been telling them that. When he dies, the enormity of his lies will come crashing down, the punchline to a bad joke.
neutral|Don't mention it! I'm always ready to lend a helping hand to a stranger in need.
disgust|This place has the Old World Blues about it. Everything in here feels like it should have passed on a long time ago.
neutral|
neutral|It's cool. I'm just a little touchy about people making fun of me, especially smoothskins. But you're not all bad. Take the Followers, for example.
neutral|What? I was talking about Death, kid. Guess that one went right over your head, didn't it? Old Sergeant Dornan would've had a field day with you.
neutral|All right, I'll start brewing.
neutral|Who knows, I might even be able to show you a Brotherhood trick or two.
neutral|We've talked Torres into giving you access to gear for a little cheaper, to help out with your travels. Hope it helps!
neutral|That's not to say I don't believe you, bu- did you just hear something?
neutral|Take it.
neutral|The mission isn't a problem. The problem is with supplies. The convicts are better armed and organized than our intel initially suggested.
neutral|One day, us prisoners decided to liberate ourselves. Killed the warden, killed the guards, took over the whole damn territory.
disgust|Yeah, what about it? I told you, we need marksmanship and explosive handling improvements.
anger|Still... what makes you think that's enough. What, you think I'm cheap?
neutral|All right, dearie, let's go.
neutral|I haven't had the pleasure. I have crossed paths with Legate Lanius, his second-in-command, however. It was... unpleasant.
anger|It isn't enough to mean well if you don't do good. I'm sure Caesar meant well, too.
neutral|And that's the Legend of the Star. Hope you enjoyed it, and hope you continue enjoying Sunset Sarsaparilla!
neutral|I wasn't aware that failing to do so was punishable, however. Interesting...
neutral|Innocent? Hardly.
sadness|Old history, boss.
sadness|While that is disheartening news, there remains hope that the other two patrols may still be found alive.
neutral|Indeed they do - an army that'll be too distracted with killing Legionaries to notice the real reason you're there.
neutral|As it so happens, I do have some thrust modules, but they're expensive. 500 caps worth of expensive.
sadness|I swore I was done with the gunslinging life - I was too old, too slow, and too beat up to protect anyone anymore.
neutral|Our drinks have many subtle flavors.
joy|Until the day when our armies meet again, envoy of Vegas - I shall wait for you on the battlefield.
neutral|Come on, help me clean this up.
fear|I'm afraid to ask.
neutral|The Outpost isn't a Legion target, yet, not like Vegas or the Dam - but if the caravans get choked here, that's going to bite NCR hard.
anger|Ethel, darling! I'll... I'll join you soon again! Someone's gonna pay first, though.
neutral|Okay, so you're familiar with Securitrons by now, obviously! I mean, some of your best friends are Securitrons, right?
neutral|The short version is that sometimes justice is a little slow, and I helped speed it up one too many times.
neutral|Let me sign off on the work order for you, then.
neutral|New in town, pardner? Well, let ol' Festus give you the lay of the land.
neutral|People called me a hero after what happened at HELIOS, but I left that battle scarred by fear, and have allowed that weakness to govern my actions.
neutral|What the fuck are you doing here? You got some kind of fucking death wish, asshole?
neutral|I've only heard rumors, since this is the furthest east our operations go. But the rumors are pretty scary.
neutral|Here. Take this, courtesy of the Ranger veterans fund.
neutral|I do, sometimes. There are days I'd give anything to out in the open air, planting explosives and laying down covering fire.
neutral|I was the one who supplied the Elder with the location of possible sites where we could find the components, so their deaths are my fault.
neutral|In any case, was there something else you wanted?
anger|And if they knew he was stealing water, so what? Westside has more of a right to that water than the NCR.
anger|Closer inspection of these caps has revealed them to be brand new. This is a problem.
neutral|They're so twitchy they'd probably do it if you reached out to hug them.
neutral|Yes, did you have an idea that might help us?
neutral|Not at all! I'm never sure how much is normally charged for this sort of thing. Here's some additional caps - that should be enough.
neutral|To start with, it was a robot that set it up! Came rolling in with a picture of a cowboy on a screen where its face should be.
neutral|We'll... we'll pay you. Whatever we got, you can have it. We'll put together a collection every couple of days.
neutral|The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
anger|What's it look like, you asshole?
neutral|The ones left on the dam didn't know what to do. The troopers routed them. Graham pulled the remaining legionaries back, but the battle was over.
neutral|Ouch.
neutral|This doesn't look too bad. We'll have you good as new in no time.
neutral|All three of them got nabbed by the Blackfoots down there, back when they were still at war with every other tribe in the southwest.
neutral|I understand your concerns, friend, and I thank you for voicing them. But the creator's will for us has been made manifest.
neutral|Do you remember the good old days where the Master ruled over us all?
joy|That's how REPCONN got their shot. So to speak.
neutral|Doesn't surprise me. Guy seemed like he'd do whatever it takes to get what he wants. Probably makes a lot of enemies.
neutral|Yeah, but only if you've got bodies to fill the suits. We don't take on new members. We're all descendents from the original Brotherhood.
neutral|Squad marksman. I'm pretty proud of the fact that I never killed a single soul who wasn't trying to kill me or one of my team first.
neutral|Every so often there'll be a commotion from that direction - explosions and such.
anger|I don't have to explain the reasoning behind my commands. I just give them - and you do them.
neutral|I hunt geckos, mostly. The meat's pretty good and I can always find a buyer for the hides.
neutral|Oh. Well, all right.
neutral|What? No! Listen, Caesar's secrets are safe with me. I stayed alive because Caesar would've wanted it. I'm useless to him dead.
anger|Godammit.
neutral|I guess they just don't make 'em like they used to.
neutral|From here, it's Nipton to the east or Primm to the north.
neutral|And so the Courier who had cheated death in the cemetery outside Goodsprings cheated death once again, and the Mojave wasteland was forever changed.
disgust|Well, fine, whatever, they can be shaking each other's dicks, wouldn't change the Mojave now.
neutral|Damn, I knew this wasn't going to work!
neutral|So if you want to buy all of Cassidy Caravans, you're looking at it - and what I got in my pockets. Still, as little as that is, not looking to sell.
neutral|You come across a pack of them, weigh your options carefully.
sadness|Hmm...
neutral|It's called an Auto-Doc. As the name suggests, it's an automated physician - more or less.
neutral|Deal with anyone else, though, you're taking a big risk.
neutral|Knight, at Mojave outpost, may be able to help.
neutral|I'm unlocking the East Power Plant. Hit the manual switch, then go topside and deal with the Legion and NCR.
neutral|You think I'm handsome? Wow, I wonder if she does, too!
neutral|Uh... yeah. I guess it works.
neutral|Crimson Caravan had some trouble here.
neutral|Don't think I'm some kind of Vault City pacifist, though - if things get heated, I'll start shooting, trust me.
neutral|Sorry, that's all the news worth talking about. All I have at least.
neutral|Nothing, man.
sadness|Got a second to talk, boss?
neutral|Then he just as patiently explained to me that Taggart's work was vital to our cause, and that he wasn't to be trifled with "lesser matters."
neutral|Make it quick.
neutral|The most likely source of these new caps is the old sarsaparilla bottling plant. Go there, locate the bottle cap press, and disable it.
neutral|If you run across any out in the wastes, turn them in to Jane. She'll compensate you.
neutral|Westside is a part of New Vegas, just as much as it's a part of the Wasteland. In the end, stranger, we need them both to continue making our fate.
anger|You're helping the Legion, a slaving army that will almost certainly kill and enslave the majority of people in New Vegas.
anger|I wound up helping Benny a lot more than he helped me. Once he had access to the Securiton's memory banks, he kicked me out of the Tops.
sadness|I'm sure she can find something for you to do. It might be kind of... depressing and terrible, though. Caveat Samaritanus.
neutral|Smart, charismatic. Hell of a mean streak. Doesn't care for humans. Prefers fighting them to talking.
neutral|Without a fall guy, it's dangerous for us to be seen together. We shouldn't speak again.
neutral|Still... thanks for bringing word. At least, now I know.
neutral|All right, then. Guess I'll just make a quiet exit - no need for a goodbye party or anything.
neutral|I've known them far longer than you have. They'll get over it.
fear|Run! Beasts got free!
neutral|Lasers, plasma, pistols, grenades - we've got it all at the Silver Rush!
neutral|Greetings, General.
neutral|If the Republics sinkhole-progress doesn't kill us, greed will. Thanks for bringing me this, I know revenge must have been tempting.
disgust|Sure, boss. The old man will crawl around in the dirt to keep hidden.
neutral|I was just saying that I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding about the mutants here in the State of Utobitha.
anger|I'm a salesman. I swing through McCarran and the dam once a week or so to take orders. But lately I spend most of my time in this piss heap.
neutral|They knew you were coming? They were better prepared than I anticipated, then. I won't underestimate them again.
neutral|Here is what we have available.
neutral|It was a covenant to protect southern Nevada against Caesar's Legion and the tyranny of his regime.
neutral|But humans must be so caught up with their pleasant features that they forget the most important thing about centaurs.
neutral|Reckon you might need one of these. Take it. Just don't wave it around here where they might take it from you.
neutral|See me as soon as you've found them.
joy|You go on and do that. Me? I think they shot their last wad today... from now on, they'll prefer targets closer to home.
neutral|I do that all the time myself. One moment I'll think I've solved the conundrum, and the next I'm back to square one. Don't let it bother you.
neutral|They were talking about some delivery they took from a courier, I assume that was you.
neutral|It's our virtual reality training hall. We don't really go out all that often anymore, so this is how we stay sharp.
neutral|If you can find out any more, I'd be interested to hear it.
anger|As far as the world knew, I was Miguel, and I was okay with that. I headed north for a while, and ended up in Tuscon - not Two-Sun, by the way.
neutral|Though Primm's citizens chafe under NCR's taxes, they benefit greatly from the increased protection and merchant traffic.
neutral|While the entire system is infected, the virus itself is spread across three terminals. The problem is that it keeps moving periodically.
sadness|Give me that paper, I'll put my name to it. No sense trying to hold the past between your fingers when it's nothing but dirt.
neutral|Hmm?
neutral|Storms pick up quick around here.
neutral|Argh. Poison.
joy|Good work with those newcomers. I think you can handle more serious business... with more serious rewards.
neutral|An outsider! In the bunker!
neutral|From here we handle most of the logistics for our operations in Nevada. Troop allocation, supply distribution, intel.
anger|Is that so?
neutral|White had a lot of promise. Wanted to be a ranger as bad as anyone I've seen. But he also had some extracurricular activities going. Now he's gone.
neutral|I'm not sure what the deal is, but although they try to put on airs, that place is just plain creepy. Maybe it's the masks.
disgust|Okay, boss. I'll just wait here, alone, while my heavily armed companion goes out of earshot. I'm sure nothing will happen.
neutral|I guess I don't have anywhere better to be.
anger|Then stop bringing it up!
neutral|If I or one of the others hears that you're topside, we might just come out and have a little chat.
neutral|What? No!
disgust|All Marco does is collect rent and take a small cut of my action. He sure as hell doesn't clean the rooms.
joy|But I suppose you're in the right place. A lot of intel comes through here.
neutral|I've been trying to get that damn thing working for days, and you decided to just start tinkering with it? Let me see that.
neutral|Once you're done with that stuff - or none of it - say the word and we'll make our move.
neutral|Then I guess you won't be knowing more, eh? But you know where to find me, should you change your mind.
joy|Well, there are worse things happening in the world, right?
neutral|General, you look well. Perhaps for not much longer.
neutral|Pace, this isn't really a good time to have this discussion...
neutral|If you're here to challenge ol' Festus to a game of Lucky Horseshoes, say "I feel lucky".
sadness|"To protect against all forms of tyranny." As simple as that. Thirty, forty years ago, the wasteland was full of despots.
neutral|Yeah, on account of my name... and the blossoms on my cheeks when I drink too much.
neutral|Everyone around here knows what's going on there but her.
neutral|We're out at the moment. Come back later.
joy|Oh, it's cool, kitten. Diane passed me the haps on that fandango with Anders. I got your back.
neutral|Done.
neutral|Whatever you say!
neutral|He's never been defeated in battle. 14 tribes have laid down arms at his boots. Another five, rendered extinct.
anger|And it doesn't mean that we should sit by and nod our heads at every absurd faux-Roman casus belli he can dream up.
neutral|Supporting all the chaos that comes with independence, the Courier was the man responsible for a truly free New Vegas.
neutral|If so, you may wish to go around that town to the south. It's been taken by slavers, and they seem to be waiting for something, or someone.
neutral|Hey, Simon. How's it hanging? Looks like you've got a little helper today.
joy|Great. Then all is right with the world.
neutral|Well, return when you have.
anger|Killing Kimball would've struck fear into the NCR. It's unfortunate that you weren't able to take advantage of this opportunity.
neutral|I am one of Caesar's Frumentarii, an infiltrator, a spy. You were not difficult to track.
sadness|I'll spare you the history lesson - talk to Papa Khan if you want to hear that story.
neutral|I swore not to say a word to no one, but an NCR deserter passed through some days ago and traded for supplies.
neutral|Which is why we're having this conversation. An outsider such as yourself would arouse less suspicion asking questions about such matters.
neutral|They must be a really nasty people! I haven't heard a single good thing about them!
disgust|Looking for love or to put me to sleep, kid?
neutral|R-Rhonda? Is that you?
neutral|That'll do nicely. I'll spin some stories about how you stopped a mugging or two and saved a kid's pet rat from certain doom!
neutral|To my knowledge, this is the first time Caesar has ever summoned one of the Dissolute to see him. Not even tribal chieftains receive this honor.
neutral|Shhhh... we're hunting shitheads.
anger|You know I won't surrender the Dam, and certainly not to the ghost man of Vegas and his new right-hand-of-the-week.
neutral|Refugees.
neutral|Maybe it's my time.
neutral|Remember, an impressive gratuity sends a message.
neutral|I prefer the solitude, and having a bunch of Super Mutants around tends to keep things safe and quiet.
neutral|That's right! My position of supreme authority must never be questioned!
neutral|Never weakened by NCR, the Fiends staged an attack against Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
neutral|Uh... it's for the co-ops. Mr. Anderson told me to do it - he said it wasn't stealing if it's for the good of everybody.
neutral|Not sure yet, something's definitely wrong. They were massacred, we should look around, find out why.
neutral|Indeed you did. And they seem to be in excellent condition.
neutral|Good news for a change. Your efforts have humbled me, outsider. You have done more than I could expect, even from my Brothers.
joy|I've come to expect nothing less from you, brave stranger.
disgust|Troopers and rangers have been dying here for more than five years while the families sit pretty behind that... damned wall.
disgust|Enjoy the fruits of your labor.
neutral|You, over there! Go back where you came from, thieves! Don't try our patience!
neutral|I would. I'm the senior-most paladin in the Chapter, and have more combat experience than any two others here put together.
neutral|I was stalking him for a while. I'm real good at that. Watching people from where they can't see me, you know?
neutral|If you could spare any ammunition, that would be really terrific.
neutral|All right, here we go. First question - who was the most popular president in NCR history, Peterson, Tibbett, Kimball, or Tandi?
anger|But if you're taking this place, you better hope you can hold it. I'll give my superiors my opinion, but I don't think they're going to listen.
neutral|
neutral|Some kind of anti-NCR rebel. Some people just don't like being pushed around and told what to do.
neutral|Then get the fuck out of my face.
joy|It's all in how you drink it, though - there's a trick to it. When we pass the bottle, I'll show you how it's done.
neutral|See that you do.
disgust|Yet if those are the words you wish to be remembered for, then I shall... *honor* them.
fear|Be *really* careful what you say here.
anger|And  when those gangs were caused by NCR in the first place, like the Powder Gangers? Caesar on a crutch, don't get me started there.
neutral|Corporal Sterling was an NCR ranger until he was captured by the Legion. They tortured him pretty badly.
neutral|All right then, I already got a head start, but I'll go first anyway.
neutral|Wahoo, you did it pardner! Bully for you! Ol' Festus knew you could do it. I suppose you'll be wanting that prize now.
neutral|That might even be a desirable thing, knowing the town was safe from the likes of them. There'd be a reward in it if some brave soul made it happen.
neutral|Hey, the gang's all here! Let's give the Mojave something to remember us by.
neutral|I'm sorry, but you didn't get all of the questions right, which proves you're not a citizen of the NCR. Sorry.
surprise|You're not kidding. You're in bad shape, friend. I'd be happy to fix you up... for a reasonable fee.
neutral|Aw, shucks, SYSTEM RUNTIME ERROR! Unable to initialize Law Enforcement Protocols, pardner!
neutral|You can always take it later. Stop back anytime.
neutral|
neutral|If you say so. I already got paid, after all.
neutral|<Makes beeping sounds>
neutral|I had to prove I could still handle a gun alongside all the recruits, but look at me now - First Recon and still going strong. You tell Betsy that.
neutral|If you would just untie my hands I'd be more than happy to share what information I have with you.
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
neutral|I am a win-ner! I am a win-ner!
neutral|The city of New Vegas finally has soldiers worthy of protecting it!
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|All right, then.
neutral|I'm not sorry for anything I did, but I will do the time. Fair enough trade, if you ask me.
neutral|I would've made you wealthy! You could've helped change the world!
neutral|
sadness|Look, the Followers have had enough of a role in the misery that this area has had to endure.
sadness|A little of both, I guess.
neutral|I am going to make your toes curl, baby.
neutral|They're slavers, led by a guy named Caesar. Or Caesar. Not sure how you're supposed to say it.
neutral|Moreno may be a stubborn son of a bitch, but at least he's loyal.
neutral|Is that right? The million dollar question is who exactly are we "settling?"
surprise|Would it surprise you to know I used to be a gunslinging adventurer?
neutral|Nonsense, probably, but there's no doubt that many in the Legion believe he's still alive somehow.
neutral|That one must be important around here!
neutral|The Lieutenant's been talking to you, hasn't he? Look, I don't need a head doctor - I'm First Recon, damn it.
neutral|Knights are in charge of all of our equipment. Power armor, gatling lasers, you name it. All of it built and maintained by Knights.
fear|Don't get me wrong. I'd rather the Brotherhood get the intel than see it lost somewhere in the desert, but I'd prefer the Followers overall.
neutral|Great! When this is taken care of, we'll be all set for the Legion to make its move.
neutral|Oh, yeah, I'm sure you're right. I mean, for one thing, it's you saying it, and you always know what you're talking about.
neutral|If you ever need to get patched up, one of their docs'll have you right as rain in no time flat. They sell supplies, too. Or used to.
surprise|You have quite the menagerie at your disposal. If you can get the posse down to "small gang" size, I'll happily go with you.
neutral|Would you mind if I looked at the message?
neutral|That was my fault! But I've changed!
neutral|How many chips would you like?
anger|Maybe they're not all true. That's enough for me to stand here and talk to you, but I'm not about to leave Freeside as your comrade-in-arms.
neutral|Corporal White caught me taking the water and made me tell on Mr. Anderson. I think something bad happened, but Mr. Anderson told me not to worry.
neutral|Yes, he's an account manager for the Crimson Caravan Company. He works such long ours to provide for our daughter and me.
neutral|Thanks for doing this. Remember, we need their resources to help us in the upcoming battle. Do whatever it takes.
neutral|But that's what he taught me. You asked what I learned from him.
neutral|Well, tell you what. You find a way to bring her here. She'll want to hear what I have to say.
neutral|Your room will be the one upstairs, closest to the lobby side.
neutral|Now that Marco's no longer around, I guess it's up to me to collect rent, too.
joy|Yeah? What about it?
neutral|Fine by me.
neutral|It's a small town, though. I'm sure someone would've noticed somebody like that if they came this way.
neutral|That must be some kind of code of honor you hold yourself to. You're like a woman possessed.
anger|Not firing on all pistons here.
neutral|Don't think everyone around here is going to tolerate your actions, outsider. A few of us have a mind to put you down like the animal you are.
neutral|Right, it's one of two locations on House's network with non-standard hardware.
neutral|Those bots are programmed to vaporize anyone who enters the fenced-in area without authorization from the greeter.
neutral|You're starting to get quite the reputation around here, aren't you? Don't get me wrong, I'm not passing judgement or anything.
neutral|Quite well. Thank you for asking, Veronica.
neutral|We've talked Torres into giving you access to gear for a little cheaper, to help out with your travels. Hope it helps!
neutral|On our way East he demanded we stop at HELIOS One to examine it. While we were there, we received word that the NCR had taken the Dam.
neutral|The Followers have extensive libraries, but we all draw water from the same old well. Even Caesar.
neutral|The Thorn demonstrates, beyond anything else, that we're self-sufficient. Our desert-blood has overcome even the strongest beasts of the Wasteland.
neutral|If we ever did go up against them on their home turf, we'd win, but casualties would be high.
neutral|I could get another working radio with the caps I already gave you. Now, how about spending some of those caps right now?
neutral|The Brotherhood? Well, this is unusual, I must say. But very welcome.
neutral|That helps.
neutral|The major froze up at the news, and we couldn't get another word out of him. I took over and salvaged the situation as best I could.
joy|Oh, it has its perks, to be sure. I'm free to see that things on a large scale are done my way, and don't have to tolerate any disagreement.
neutral|Hmmm... there's still power, but the casing is cracked. I'm astonished that exposure to the stealth radiation could induce mutations so rapidly.
neutral|You, over there! Go back where you came from, thieves! Don't try our patience!
neutral|
neutral|The leader of the tribe is a woman named Marjorie. My understanding is that she strongly opposes a reversion to cannibalism.
neutral|Never sided with a group of marauders before. But I think the Brotherhood stands a better chance against them than they did against the NCR.
neutral|So militarily, yes, I want them to help NCR. If possible, I'd like to figure out a way to help the NCR win Hoover Dam without holding New Vegas.
neutral|My scouts have seen people moving around the base. The perimeter is guarded, with spotters in towers directing the artillery fire.
joy|No, and thanks to General Oliver for that. Colonel Hsu is at McCarran. Most of the New Vegas troopers are under his command.
neutral|Only merchants, slaves and Legion come here.
neutral|Hello.
neutral|Well, anyway, Judah's given Orion's armor to you now. It'll take a few hours for me to show you how to use it properly, so let's get started.
neutral|They should. I guess it's possible that some don't, but this stuff is pretty common knowledge.
neutral|This was the same fire that burned in the heart of the Old World that preceded us.
neutral|Watch out for the Misfits here - 9th Platoon, word of their fuck-ups is legendary.
neutral|Not much, and I haven't had occasion to look for anything more than that.
neutral|Maybe it's enough just to do good for the short time that we're here. No one's going to sing Doc Henry's praises when he's gone.
neutral|The Elder must know of what happened here. Take this report to him. It contains my notes on these events. Maybe he'll make some sense of it all.
sadness|They were all dead, then. I suppose I'm not surprised. We have few friends in the world above, and many enemies.
neutral|I guess we can thank NCR for that. Anyway, just a bit of information about Mr. House's technology could go a long way.
joy|See, that's why you should retire before your brain goes. Oh. Sorry, boss. Bad choice of words.
joy|Always happy to repeat myself for you, boss.
neutral|Please handle this information with the utmost care as it represents the sum total of the results of my research on the Duraframe Eyebots.
neutral|I suppose I could be a loving muse to some, while simply relieve stress and tension in others. Thanks for that insight.
neutral|Don't think everyone around here is going to tolerate your actions, outsider. A few of us have a mind to put you down like the animal you are.
neutral|For you? I'm not sure I want to be seen dealing with you... but if you're willing to pay a little extra...
sadness|Just a few days after Mexico City was vaporized, refugees started pouring down the road to our ranch. We helped who we could, but there were so many.
neutral|That's fine. I'll let you take the test again whenever you choose to come back.
neutral|The Courier, with the aid of Yes Man, drove both the Legion and the NCR from Hoover Dam, securing New Vegas' independence from both factions.
neutral|We're the finest sniper outfit in the whole NCR. If you need a bullet put into a target's eye from 800 yards away, you call us.
neutral|Shh...
neutral|Arcade had hoped that Freeside would be able to remain independent of NCR rule, but he was glad that Caesar's Legion had been stopped at Hoover Dam.
neutral|I'm fine now.
neutral|It's fascinating, but depressing. Whatever technology he has can't possibly be practical for the people out here.
neutral|The Brotherhood used the information recovered from ED-E to create a small army of Duraframe Eyebots.
neutral|Smart move, kid. We're happy to have you come on in and spend some dough at the bar, take in a show, whatever - but you're cut off from the games.
neutral|Ooh, look, pumpkin! A dinosaur! Do you want to ride the dinosaur?
surprise|Why are you crazy? That's a question for someone much wiser and more patient than myself.
neutral|You know, guarding the door's not that complicated. Maybe you'd be better off in another line of work.
anger|Used to call me "Whiskey Rose" back West, before I punched enough people, so now they say it, but quiet and when I'm not around.
sadness|Neither did Anderson.
fear|The only reason I'm telling you any of this is because he's gone now.
anger|They got nothing on you, baby! Keep it up!
neutral|Our scouts have reported that the NCR's President Kimball will be visiting the Dam. This is an excellent opportunity to assassinate him.
neutral|Please, don't let me keep you if you have somewhere else to be.
neutral|I'm in no rush to give the supplies back, either.
neutral|Actually, I've got a better idea. Make the new hire tell her. You'll do that for me, won't you?
neutral|I don't go looking for fights with them, but they don't have the best interests of people in mind. Certainly not locals.
neutral|The Dam will fall, and the rest of the Profligate west will soon follow.
neutral|
neutral|I'll grant you access to that portion of the history section of our datastore. See Senior Scribe Ibsen about accessing it.
neutral|That they have not responded to this violence shows either an unwillingness or inability to properly defend their borders, which is telling.
neutral|There's a chance I could crash us in the middle of Lake Mead - that place seems to attract aircraft, for some reason.
joy|Or maybe the whole thing's a crazy coincidence. Who knows?
neutral|Having never received a replacement brain, Rex finally succumbed to old age, abruptly shutting down forever one quiet morning.
neutral|Yeah. I think if I stayed I'd end up causing trouble. Sometimes I just can't help myself.
neutral|Ironically, NCR refugees found Freeside safer than most of the rest of New Vegas, where resentment still lingers.
neutral|The Great Khans' legacy was swiftly forgotten.
neutral|Done.
neutral|An interesting story. It may even be true.
anger|They've got some camps on the eastern shore of the Colorado, and the monstrosity on the hill across the lake - that's for Caesar.
joy|You know you put up a good fight. I'm impressed.
joy|By the way, I appreciate what you did for the troopers down there.
neutral|Exactly one of the reasons I got out of that job. Too many shifty characters looking to have someone else move their hot items.
neutral|I've got it! I'll say you slew a nest of Deathclaws living in the sewers! It was bloody work, but you waded through the pack like a man possessed!
neutral|Done.
neutral|Fine, then.
anger|Oh? You're going to defy me?
neutral|Keith! In the name of the NCR, I'm placing you under arrest for illicit gambling.
anger|This again? All right. What do you want to know?
neutral|Predecessor's records indicate matching item purchased by nervous man wearing metal collar.
fear|Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
joy|Hnh. Maybe Jackson got some additional soldiers after all. Didn't take you for a trooper at first, you seem a little... livelier than most.
neutral|No.
neutral|Can't. The King's got me busy on something.
neutral|
neutral|My commander, you ignorant degenerate! Now, will you go before Dead Sea?
neutral|Just hanging out. Same as usual.
neutral|I'm sure it's the highlight of your day. Anyway, I've gotta bounce. Things to do, and all that.
neutral|Here's your key. Let me know if there's anything I can do to make your stay better for you.
neutral|Goodbye.
anger|You guys are actually going to help the Legion? No thanks - count me out of this one.
neutral|Well, you see, I... fuck. I'm really a bounty hunter trying to catch some Powder Gangers, but they probably saw through me, just like you did.
neutral|If I die... take care of my salvage.
neutral|This is a null line no one will ever see.
fear|Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
anger|Won't trade with Khans - they've poisoned most of the villages west of Vegas with chems.
neutral|No... no, you're here in the Legate's camp first, I think that says enough.
neutral|Usually we call in our positions to McCarran to be relayed to other rangers, but I can handle myself.
neutral|Despite her extreme actions, she was awarded with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
neutral|Come back soon, now!
neutral|Man, I'm tired of scrounging for caps from ungrateful idiots like you. It's past time I moved on to bigger and better things.
neutral|I never really considered joining before. But now that I think about it, it really sounds like it could be a good fit, doesn't it?
sadness|Things have been rough for a while now, even with Jack working all the time and my runners making deliveries daily we're barely getting by.
neutral|Soon after that, he requested that I get transferred to VR specialist training, serving as his assistant.
neutral|Techs strip out the joint servos so you don't need special training to wear it.
fear|Because I know when fighting breaks out at the dam, all hell is going to break loose in Freeside. They're going to need every doctor they can get.
neutral|Have a look.
sadness|Honestly, it isn't too difficult if you have half a brain and aren't a complete jerk. I wanted to help people and I enjoyed learning, so I signed up.
anger|That one... had a little kick to it. The poisonous kind of kick.
neutral|<bark! bark!>
neutral|Guess NCR's fish food.
joy|Couldn't cover much ground. It took groups like ours to tip the balance back to the good guys.
neutral|They try to put their stake in everything they see.
neutral|Yet you failed, and you must pay.
anger|Armor's for shit.
neutral|With its logs cleared and its systems upgraded ED-E  remained a vigilant and constant companion to the courier.
fear|Let me see. My God, this is even worse than I thought. Okay, you have my support. I'll tell Papa the alliance is a bad idea.
neutral|<Coughing Fit>
neutral|I'll leave the fighting to the old warhorses. It's what they were made for.
neutral|If you're buying our ear for the moment, Hoover Dam's more than a fistful of caps to my superiors. Vegas is interesting... the East...
neutral|At odds with leadership over the Brotherhood's future, Veronica looked to the Mojave Wasteland for an answer both she and they could live with.
neutral|Eventually she became little more than a ravening beast, the kindly old grandmother subsumed beneath the rage.
anger|You don't think very far ahead, do you?
anger|We'll deal with Benny when the time comes. In the meantime...
neutral|I guess it's time we talked the dumb-dumbs.
joy|What I would have done.
neutral|Go back to your general or commodore or whatever-the-fuck and tell them to shove their ultimatum where the sun don't shine.
sadness|That was a long time ago, before we exchanged the warmth of our home for the thin air of the Wasteland.
neutral|You're not stationed here, but your rep with the NCR speaks for itself. It's mostly rifle rounds, but I'll throw in a few boxes of pistol ammo.
neutral|The Thorn awakens us to the truth. Here we escape from our bonds, and choose the moment of death against the will of destiny.
neutral|Now, as for your next assignment...
neutral|Here you go.
neutral|Ha! If we had spare parts, do you think I'd be asking you to fix the damn things? That's rich.
neutral|The presence of the Nightkin leader, Keene, persuaded Nightkin from across the wasteland to make the journey to the town.
neutral|Where else?
joy|If that's your idea of diplomacy, then things are looking miles better on my side of the fence.
neutral|If I'm there with you, shouldn't be hard to spot. And I'd prefer to see the bodies with my own eyes.
anger|There's a handful of greasers down in the sewers causing trouble. They ain't packing too much iron, but I'd like them dealt with all the same.
neutral|Because war... war never changes.
neutral|Its X-25 gatling laser, produced to spec by Glastinghouse, Inc., is deadly  against soft targets at medium range...
neutral|Or they're on leave, on their way to New Vegas to piss away their pay. All of them, passing through.
neutral|
neutral|Eventually, using the Followers' remaining supplies to manufacture drugs, the Old Mormon Fort quickly devolved into little more than a junkie den.
disgust|That seems highly illogical. What reason would he have for doing that?
neutral|Sorry, but there's nobody left who'd even be a challenge for you.
neutral|Lot of the mutants here found out about Jacobstown because of Neil. Our isolation works against us sometimes.
neutral|That's right. Strange at first, having a woman for a pimp, but she's tough enough to handle any trouble so far.
neutral|Very well, I'll take your word when you say she isn't a threat to the tribe. I will allow her entry if Jack will take responsibility for her.
joy|That Loyal guy. He's getting up there in years, but he still finds a way to make himself useful to his people.
surprise|Had he taken the government by force, used his army to stage a coup, things would be very different.
anger|This weapon isn't working! And Leo doesn't like that very much!
neutral|Driver Nephi is a monster in close combat with that golf club of his, and that man is about as fast on his feet as any Legionary.
neutral|Ahh! Loud! Onetwothreefourfivesixseveneightninetenonetwothreefourfivesixseveneightnineten!
surprise|Benny, huh? Sorry boss, doesn't ring a bell. Then again, my brain isn't as sharp as it used to be.
anger|You take your letter, pay my respects to Alice, then kindly go fuck yourself.
neutral|If I work out of there, I'll still be able to keep tabs on Hidden Valley if I needed to. I know that route like the back of my hand.
joy|I got a bar, men who don't say a word, and plenty of whiskey, I'm fine.
neutral|All right, let's do it, listen to what he has to say.
neutral|I'll give you whatever you want, just hurry!
anger|Damn slavers.
anger|Praetorians, to arms!
neutral|Yeah, I guess there's a thing or two I could show you. Sounds like you need all the help you can get after what they done to you.
neutral|We've had reported sightings of Mr. House's Securitrons spying on both NCR and Legion forces.
neutral|Well, I have been working with some UV lights in the pods.
neutral|That's nothing new. Am I supposed to be impressed?
neutral|
neutral|Bodyguards make a good honest living, and I had the wits and physical build to handle most thugs.
anger|You better watch yourself out there. A loose cannon like yourself can sometimes run out of luck at just the wrong time.
neutral|As the old saying goes, two's company, but three's a small army. Okay, I'm paraphrasing a bit, but you get the idea.
neutral|Well, you look to be the trustworthy sort. Okay, I'll tell you what I know.
neutral|Today we're proud to have Best Friend Tabitha with us. Welcome to the show!
sadness|That was... that was hard to watch.
disgust|Oh, sure thing. I haven't even remotely grown sick of staring at this place.
neutral|Disgruntled by the death of their leader, Keene, most of the Nightkin scattered into the wasteland, their insanity worsening with each day.
