sadness|<Sighs> Ain't nobody got one darned piece of news about my boy? Not one lousy speck of information?
neutral|Better be a good reason. I didn't join up with you to go on nature walks.
surprise|Well, what do we have here, huh? Let me guess. You've heard about the mistress who makes all your fantasies come true.
anger|I don't wanna fucking hear it. You've lost the trust of the family. Goodbye, I hope Hell isn't too hot for you.
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
anger|Who the hell are you? Better yet, what the hell are you doing in this cursed place?
anger|Come out and face your death!
anger|Death to the Legion's enemies!
neutral|Oh, you're charming in your own way, I suppose. Not budging on the price for those parts, though.
neutral|When House gave us the Tops to renovate, his robots dropped off boxes full of suits and ties and wingtip shoes. Told us we were the "Chairmen" now.
neutral|Sorry, but blackening our reputation with our biggest client isn't worth the risk.
neutral|Okay. This will just take a moment.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
anger|People fight and die for what they believe in. I'm just here to patch them up so they can go on their merry way. Do no harm and all that.
neutral|Aw, you really know how to make a girl feel like a stray cat.
surprise|Aha!
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
anger|Drop it. Now why the hell are you here?
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
disgust|Thought as much. Nothing there after all.
neutral|They know stuff about tech and medicine and usually help out anybody who asks. Can't say I know any more than that.
neutral|I... I don't know what I want. But I hate this place, and I hate these people.
neutral|Guess we have that in common, then.
joy|You're cleared to go on through.
surprise|Really? I never thought I'd see the day.
joy|They have a fantastic menu at the diner.
anger|No!
joy|The Lucky 38, all lit up in the distance? It's an inviting target.
anger|Name's Regis - I'm Papa Khan's advisor and right-hand man. I'm also the chief enforcer of the tribe's laws - so watch your behavior.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
disgust|Friendly warning, you might want to steer clear of NCR facilities. You're not exactly popular.
fear|Was a time I would've agreed with you. But this... it's too big, it affects too many people. I can't get hung up on those details.
neutral|Here's your chip. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|Yeah, I could've ended buried in the sands with just my head sticking out. Ants love that - a riot, know what I mean?
neutral|Novac: Vilified.
neutral|Well, keep at it.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
neutral|Hey, welcome to Red Rock Canyon! Since you've done so much for the Great Khans, Papa Khan told me to let you know you can buy weapons at our Armory.
anger|I hope that satisfies your curiosity about me, because I won't waste any more of Caesar's time talking about myself.
joy|She flashed it around, all over town,
sadness|Mr. House has everything to do with Vault 21. He tried to get us out before he filled it with concrete.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
fear|Just, don't do anything crazy.
anger|You'll pay for what you did to our soldiers at Forlorn Hope, murderer!
sadness|It was m-my fault. See... I was kn-knocked out when it happened. That b-big guy sneaked up on us. I let B-Betsy down.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
surprise|Most patients don't get out of bed after being shot and then move like they was in perfect control. You're unusual, I'll say that.
neutral|I met Carla while I was at the Strip on leave. She said I looked lost.
surprise|Hey, you're the one that's been hunting the most dangerous beasts for The Thorn!
surprise|Great, just when you think the NCR can't possibly sink their claws deeper, the town of Primm signs up to join the Republic.
joy|How can I help you?
neutral|You're the boss.
joy|Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
neutral|Third-place runners-up got enslaved. I got the fuck beat out of my legs, and the winner they let go free.
neutral|Artillery of this sort has a range of several miles. If it's going to fire on Hoover Dam, I want it firing at my targets.
fear|Holy shit! Run for your lives!
surprise|The owner of the Vault was murdered. I thought we were safe inside the Strip.
disgust|Murderer!
anger|What the fuck are you doing? My brother died at the Battle of Hoover Dam. You're desecrating a war memorial.
neutral|Okay, I won't!
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
neutral|What happened?
neutral|I know sometimes I sound like I don't. I know. But there's something that still rings true to me about our code.
neutral|What's your reputation with Primm?
anger|You and I have got nothing to talk about.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
neutral|The fountain is for wishes, ladies.
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
anger|Damn!
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
neutral|Now it's the Wrights and Van Graffs. Seems like things never get better. Anyway, that's all behind me now.
sadness|Red Lucy was a fine warrior, and a beautiful woman.
neutral|The only thing down there is a swim of several hundred feet against the current. You'd drown for sure.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
anger|You shouldn't be here. If people know we talked, they'll suspect you.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
joy|Here I was thinking you'd be a challenge, want a rematch?
neutral|I see - you're in a predicament.
surprise|Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
joy|Excessive use causes dilated eyes, an increased heart rate and blood pressure, massive sweating, you know... the usual.
neutral|Very well. Will there be anything else?
disgust|I'll send Major Polatli word about the situation here.
fear|We need more firepower!
neutral|I live to serve Caesar's will - and the will of the Legion. If my victory serves them both, then I am pleased.
anger|This is our turf. Don't even try to snoop around or I'll fucking kill your right here, right now.
sadness|We'll die out.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
joy|I hear the Great Khans are pretty tough, I hope we can join them.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
joy|Are you okay?
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
fear|I don't want any trouble, okay?
disgust|Caesar is not fond of loose cannons like yourself. I sincerely hope you change your ways before something drastic must occur.
disgust|The salvage business has really slowed down since those ghouls took over REPCONN.
surprise|Oof!
anger|Grrrraah!
fear|What now?
neutral|Here's your chip. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|I get it, you're sore. A crumb's life is painful. But soon you won't feel a thing. Ta-ta.
anger|Hey, that's mine!
surprise|The big showdown between the NCR and the Legion is coming soon, believe you me.
anger|What have you done?
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
fear|Look, I've got people to care for. I'm not looking for trouble.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
anger|I don't trust those creeps at the Ultra-Luxe.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
joy|Nice work at the Tops buddy.
neutral|Really?  Huh, never thought of that.  The Crimson Caravan isn't really in the drug business.
neutral|Uhh, hey. Welcome to Red Rock Canyon. You've seemed a little bipolar lately - maybe you're having withdrawal symptoms?
anger|If the NCR wasn't spread so thin, maybe we could actually get some supplies and reinforcements around here.
neutral|Yeah, he used to come around here a lot. Haven't seen him in a while, though. Why?
sadness|I see. Then the Great Khans will fight for the Legion should Caesar give the call. If you change your mind, let me know.
neutral|Was there something else?
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
surprise|NCR... did you just crawl out from under a rock? Those folks only care about their business, their people and their pockets.
neutral|Sources at the Dam are telling us that the involvement of one key person appears to have heavily influenced the outcome.
anger|Are you trying to get my saloon shot up? Finish what you started!
surprise|Hey!
neutral|They pick you out if you do well at the firing range. Pays a little better, so I said okay.
anger|Damn it!
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
neutral|And why would you have done that?
surprise|Both Gundersons, gone? I'll be damned, you are one of a kind!
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|Very well. Will there be anything else?
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
neutral|Bye.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
neutral|His destination is hardly a mystery. It's a near certainty that he's making his way for Caesar's camp, at Fortification Hill.
joy|You can't hide from me.
anger|What in Creation is the matter with you? Ain't you ever been a parent? Ain't you ever been worried you lost someone?
anger|You pushed me too far!
anger|I'm kind of busy, what do you want?
sadness|It's a shame about President Kimball, he was a good man.
surprise|Aha!
neutral|This slaughter pleases me. No act is more sacred than consecrating a site in the blood of one's enemies.
disgust|Better not try that again.
anger|Flank 'em!
disgust|I've got a shipment of Jet and Psycho that needs to be delivered to Motor Runner at Vault 3.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
anger|You can't hide from Leo!
anger|I don't trust those creeps at the Ultra-Luxe.
anger|I should kill you myself for what you did to Kimball, and fuck the law!
joy|Here you go. Put it to good use.
neutral|Rex will be tougher.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
disgust|Why not let the robot deal with it?
disgust|I'm guessing you don't really know how this business works, kid. My offer is very generous already. Think about it.
surprise|Huh?
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|So fucked up I can't feel my legs.
anger|Come on, boss, I know I'm ugly, but I am on your side.
neutral|Very much appreciated. These caps will go towards funding schools and other services to the poorer part of the community.
neutral|An assassin attacked the president in full view of the crowd, but was not apprehended. Witness descriptions of the killer differ wildly.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
anger|
neutral|Very well. Please stand back - I don't want any erroneous readings. You're welcome to stay and observe if you want, though.
neutral|Caesar's Legion: Wild Child.
disgust|For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
surprise|Now that don't make a lick of sense. Seems to me you're the luckiest son-of-a-gun in New Vegas.
neutral|Don't kill anybody if you don't have to. I'm a scout, and I like to keep a low profile.
surprise|Grenade!
neutral|Those last five shots were a bad idea...
disgust|Hmm. Sometimes when you give tests like this, you learn more than you was hoping for, and I reckon that ain't always the best thing.
neutral|Tread lightly, fool. You are entering Caesar's land.
anger|Vault 3's Fiend territory. Those shit-heads attack Westside all the time, even making it to the rest of Outer Vegas when they crawl under the sewers.
disgust|Just like you said five minutes ago. Don't worry, boss, I got it.
anger|Let's see you handle this!
disgust|That's... an unfortunate mistake.
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
neutral|Just off the turbine room down below are three power regulators. It's a redundant system - only one is needed.
sadness|Because of a promise. One I haven't been able to keep. The Nightkin all suffer from schizophrenia. It's the Stealth Boys they use, used to use.
joy|Another satisfied customer.
fear|Leave me alone!
anger|You bastard!
neutral|Why do they call it a monorail... it's a train. A *train.*
surprise|You truly are something else! Those Omertas looked like they were going to kill Carlitos on the spot.
neutral|I'm the person who will pay you when you complete the delivery contract you signed. Now go get the Chip.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
neutral|Uh, sure. I'll just be going then.
anger|Grrrraah!
surprise|What in Maxson's name?
joy|Company readiness reports are logged on the computer systems at the Resort. If you hack the system, you could alter our records.
disgust|We'll remain until the camp is packed up. If you have some plan, see to it quickly.
anger|Look out!
sadness|You're new here aren't you? Don't tell me we're actually going to get reinforcements.
neutral|If you cover the area methodically, I'm quite certain you'll happen upon them with only the most insubstantial of delays.
anger|Who's got a target?
anger|I don't have time to talk. There's lots of work to be done here.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
neutral|I don't really like to go to bed until it gets dark out.
neutral|Here, this is the key to their collars. You'll want to take those off before you go far, trust me.
anger|They dragged us and everybody else into the center of town. And that asshole with a dog on his head, he starts talking about how we're bad people!
joy|So you're the one that saved President Kimball. Damn glad to have you on our side.
joy|You're always welcome among the Followers, friend.
anger|Had enough?
sadness|Quartermaster Mayes was yelling at us about rationing again. Where does the guy get the energy to yell so much while on rations?
neutral|Want to dance, hit Gomorrah.
surprise|Grenade!
surprise|So anyway, how about those hostages?
sadness|I heard Chief Hanlon is dead. How are we going to fight the Legion without him?
neutral|People have been counterfeiting bottle caps forever, but it's always been small scale.
joy|See, that wasn't so bad. Anything else I can do for you?
joy|That was a good day for The Thorn.
joy|I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
joy|Good to see you, amicus.
joy|It was a matter of time before someone got to Mr. House.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
surprise|You think me a fool? We wouldn't hire an outsider to deal with a traitor.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
neutral|Once you're ready, meet me outside on the observation deck, but don't take too long.
neutral|So what if I did? What are you going to do about it?
neutral|Primm: Rascal.
anger|Beat it, or I'll call the bots on you right quick.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
neutral|I'll surrender on one condition - you protect Westside's secret. Without that water, this community won't survive long.
neutral|We hope to forge a brave new world free of war and poverty by sharing knowledge and resources. Our primary goal is the free exchange of ideas.
joy|Okay. Um... do you think you could help me?
surprise|Holy shit!
joy|Good to see you again!
neutral|And that's the news.
fear|How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
joy|Same stuff. Any NCR weapons, computer parts, or radio parts.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
neutral|Okay, listen here. Unless we can get some additional support, I'm going to need you to help me resolve this situation.
joy|Did you hear about the Legion Defeat at Nelson? We're winning back our territories.
sadness|Hope those Fiends give us no trouble.
joy|This is The Thorn! Here's where the strong make a name for themselves and the weak are fed to the jaws of hell.
disgust|You here to help, or just dick around all day?
joy|That was a good day for The Thorn.
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
joy|Steeling our pure-breed resolve, that's how! We've faced the Wasteland right in the old mug and told her to shove it!
neutral|Nah, I gave it up years ago. Too dangerous. And even if I did still collect them, I'd tell you the same.
joy|Why don't you just come out where I can see you?
surprise|Hey!
neutral|Huh. Maybe Father Elijah had the right idea.
joy|Hot damn do I love this place.
fear|Okay, carry on. And, we've never been here, you understand? Boss doesn't need to know about this.
anger|We Followers aren't pushovers!
neutral|Let's go. We're wasting our time.
joy|Good. Hey, I got another job for you if you're interested.
neutral|Well, you'll probably be fine. For a little while, anyway.
surprise|Holy shit!
joy|Also, if you're any good at covert ops, I would love to get a bug planted on their radio. So far, we've been unable to crack their encryption.
joy|And you didn't even get skinned alive. I'm impressed. Here's your payment.
neutral|Sure thing.
fear|It can't be! How the hell...
anger|You will be avenged, Brother.
anger|
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
anger|I don't have any supplies to spare, but I've got caps if you have anything you don't need.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
surprise|I've heard about you.
anger|Yeah, right. Dick.
disgust|What the fuck was that? I've seen crippled slaves move faster.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
neutral|Oooh, those Nightstalkers, always killing my Bighorners! It'll be nice to give them a piece of my mind!
anger|I dunno, I just love it here. What the fuck do you think, asshole?
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
anger|I do not question Caesar's will! I do not second-guess!
disgust|To what purpose? It's highly unlikely you'd understand anything I'd say.
anger|What the hell do you want?
anger|You tracked me across the desert, Sugar Plum. Finding the Presidential? Easy pickings.
joy|That Fiend leader got what he fucking deserved.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
fear|You, uhh, you want to point that someplace else, boss? I got enough holes in me.
neutral|VStoryEventCampGolf set to 3.
surprise|Grenade!
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
sadness|Just about my whole life, ever since my daddy left ma and me and went off to roam the wastes.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
neutral|I know that, dearie.
sadness|Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
joy|This is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. Thank you.
neutral|I was young and I needed the money.
anger|That's not a good idea.
disgust|Everyone is either starving or dying out here. Left out to dry by the rest of the NCR. Fuck this place.
anger|I know he's dead. I know he's no longer a factor. That's all I need to know.
joy|There you are! Were you trying to hide from me?
neutral|Zone clear! Advance to the next position.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
disgust|O'Hanrahan's a big pussy, ain't good for shit in a fight, and Mags... well, Mags is cut out for something other than soldiering, you dig?
surprise|Where'd she go?
anger|All right. I'll let it go - this time.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
joy|You're a model citizen, thank you.
joy|This hall leads to our guest rooms. You can use the first room on our left. But no snooping next door! That's my room, always was.
joy|Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
neutral|Kimball's entire political career is inextricably bound up with the NCR's occupation of the Mojave. It's his war.
surprise|Hey!
anger|Shut up and keep going.
joy|That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
neutral|No.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
anger|What was that for?
fear|Oh! Well, I heard... I mean, we heard... we meaning the Followers of the Apocalypse... that you had been in there. The Lucky 38, I mean.
disgust|Eesh, is my act that bad, or are you just that dumb? Yeah, that's right - got me a nice, juicy contract with the management.
joy|With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
joy|About the shortage of Hydra right? We all have our own ways to deal with this place. Me, I sometimes walk at night. Calms the nerves.
neutral|VStoryEvenFiends set to 0.
anger|Let's see you handle this!
anger|It's time for blood, not talk. Find me after the fight.
neutral|Why's everything spinning?
fear|Thanks, but if Bishop finds me and I don't have his money, my balls are going to be on his trophy wall.
neutral|Hence, Benny was captured or killed - possibly by you, but by my estimates, far more probably by Caesar's Legion. Hence, Caesar gave you the Chip.
joy|This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
joy|Thanks.
surprise|I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
anger|How the hell did the monorail blow up? Someone's bringing back luck into the Strip, I tell you.
joy|Excellent. Killing the Legion commanders in Nelson will severely cripple the Legion forces and allow us to take back the city.
neutral|What, we leaving *already?*
surprise|Right on, let's have it!
surprise|I've never seen a robot like that before.
joy|I'm impressed to say the least, and that's no easy thing. You've secured NCR's future - the administration sends its thanks, for what it's worth.
neutral|You know what? I don't need this bullshit right now. We'll take off that goddamn power armor, if it'll just shut you up.
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
joy|That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
neutral|Have you considered that he might be senile?
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|They held out as long as they could. Lost most of their force before they retreated. Gave us a little parting gift, too.
neutral|Sure.
neutral|NCR sources say that holding the Dam against Caesar's Legion has become their main strategic priority, and this move would not be unexpected.
anger|You better watch yourself around here.
anger|Vault 3's Fiend territory. Those shit-heads attack Westside all the time, even making it to the rest of Outer Vegas when they crawl under the sewers.
anger|Look, I ain't a harbor for illusions. I ain't expecting to get out of this shin-dig alive.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|I watch over the Bighorners. They're sweet, gentle creatures, but sometimes they get ornery. Just like my grandkids!
surprise|Your robot looks worth quite a few caps.
neutral|Go find a minefield and practice that "trick" several times, then. Idiot.
neutral|I'm willing to bet that wherever they're hiding, there's a working reactor powering their equipment. That's their vulnerability.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
anger|Nobody messes with the Kings.
surprise|Hey!
sadness|Where are you?
joy|Now you're talking! That is the ring-a-ding move, baby.
neutral|I've spent too many years waiting for this moment to see it fumbled by an insubordinate contractor.
anger|What the hell are you doing here? Civilians shouldn't be here.
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
anger|You should be listening, that's what you should be doing.
joy|Could use a hundred of you, just scatter you over the East like jacks, give those plumed fucks the what-for.
neutral|Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
neutral|Thanks for your support. I'll make sure that the NCR Emergency radio is up and running. Go kill those bastards.
joy|Going to place me a good bet at The Thorn.
anger|No need to be rude, pal. Just trying to bring the joy of entertainment into your life!
surprise|Hey, who says I can't fix that? You bring me those boom-suits too, okay?
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
anger|These days, I spend most of my time trying to beat a little discipline into the soldiers under my command. They've gotten soft with no action.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
joy|Mr. House finally wised up and said he'd join the NCR in a year or something like that. Good news all around.
neutral|Awaiting a delivery, but it's a no-show. I'm guessing that the Deathclaws in the quarry have something to do with that.
surprise|Picked the wrong time for hide and seek.
joy|It's a fitting revenge for Searchlight. Thanks for taking care of those bastards for us.
disgust|Harder than you think. I don't want you blowing us both up, so I'll just hold on to this.
surprise|Hey!
neutral|The Legion will swell with the number of slaves we will claim from this place, and the tribute we gather will fund further campaigns.
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
joy|I really hope that incident at REPCONN doesn't drive people away. Novac was starting to do well!
joy|Okay! How can I help you?
anger|Can you handle this?
joy|In fact, there's more hope in wrangling Brahmin with my grandmother's stocking than inspiring these troopers.
disgust|Okay, I won't bother.
sadness|Gone to their reward.
disgust|Kimball dead, maybe the NCR will learn to stay the fuck out of other people's business.
neutral|The President is scheduled to arrive sometime in the afternoon. It's going to be a short visit to boost morale for the NCR troops.
surprise|Amazingly, they've still managed to outwit a half-blind arthritic ghoul.
neutral|With two contubernia at my command, I've killed and captured four times my numbers.
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
joy|Hot damn do I love this place.
neutral|I see that now. I thought I knew him better than that. But it was like talking to a stranger.
joy|Are you okay?
neutral|Word out of Camp Golf is that many NCR Rangers can expect redeployment in the near future. One anonymous soldier said it was part of a new strategy.
neutral|Yeah.
neutral|Kids. Run by sh- shumtimes.
anger|I bet this'll hurt!
fear|With Caesar dead, I'm afraid for the women. The Legate is a brutal man, and he enjoys inflicting pain.
neutral|Look alive, guys, you're on NCR time.
joy|I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
anger|They killed him!
joy|You better control thatthing. Bots can't be trusted.
joy|I really appreciate those books. They've already been a huge help.
joy|Won't have to worry about those Fiend assholes for some time now, huh?
neutral|Which faction?
anger|Dammit, I thought I had you there. Let's play again.
anger|You want to hear the story of the Great Khans? It's a long one, full of honor, glory and betrayal. We have suffered, but we will regain our glory.
anger|I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
joy|Jackpot, baby! I knew we'd see eye to eye!
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
fear|I don't know, unfortunately. There may be clues somewhere inside the camp, but I'm not about to run in there to find out.
joy|Caesar's dead. Bet he didn't see this coming when he was having his coffee this morning.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
sadness|I sat down at a roulette table with my life savings. An hour later, it was gone.
surprise|What the hell happened with these readiness reports? These scores are way too high!
anger|I don't want to be seen with the likes of you. Get lost.
anger|The robots collect House's share of the take every week and life goes on. Ain't exactly what I'd call leadership.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
fear|As you wish, chieftain.
surprise|I heard some Squatters talking about some fancy pants Rangers coming into the area soon. Like we need more NCR here.
anger|Grrrraah!
neutral|On how many can you take, stranger?
joy|At least this way the badasses with the top-shelf guns are on my side.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
neutral|Okay.
surprise|You hear about this courier doing shit around the Strip? Like what, delivering mail?
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
neutral|The other thing I heard is that he wasn't really commanding the army anymore. Guess we made sure of that.
joy|Confident, I like that.
surprise|Do I look like a seamstress to you? Those boomsters can stay in their nowhereville until the sun runs out of gas, for all I care. No deal.
neutral|Silliest dressed band of raping, slaving marauders you'll see east of California, I'll say that. Where's that touch of Old World class?
surprise|Aha!
neutral|If I transplant this brain into Rex, he'll be a bit more ferocious in his attacks.
joy|You can't hide from me.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
anger|They killed him!
neutral|This program was brought to you by Gomorrah. Gomorrah. It'll be our secret.
neutral|Everything was great until McLafferty came along. That old bitch is gonna hear about it from my dad, just you wait.
neutral|And what benefit would this alliance give us?
surprise|Hello! It was you, set the Khans free down in Boulder City? You did that? Oh shit.
anger|Don't you know who I work for?
anger|It's quiet out here. We like to keep it that way.
anger|Flank 'em!
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
joy|I hope you're doing well, friend!
neutral|Later.
neutral|Esteban's going home now. I can't tell you what that means to me.
surprise|Grenade!
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
anger|This job's boring enough without talking to you. Go see Alexander.
anger|We Followers aren't pushovers!
joy|One of these days, Red Lucy's going to show off her Deathclaws.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
joy|One day I'll get to see Deathclaws tear through Fiends!
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
sadness|If I don't get more water soon, I won't make my quota this season.
disgust|Nope. The NCR's been trying to switch over to using paper money, like in the Pre-War days. Trouble is that the exchange rates ain't exactly fair.
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
disgust|Nero's the pack leader and Big Sal's his right hand. What Nero wants, Big Sal does. Then there's... Cachino.
anger|Yeah, well, somebody has to wrangle those washouts and losers. Somebody's got to turn them into a real fighting force.
neutral|You may continue, but be warned. Mark or no, we will not tolerate aggressive action by visitors in the camp.
fear|What!? No, please! Here, take the caps but please don't hurt me!
fear|One of my buddies said that he saw Caesar out rallying the Legion. If that's true, we're definitely screwed.
anger|You a merc? 'Cause you don't look like a prospector...
joy|Hey, It's great what you're doing for The Thorn, way to go!
surprise|Killing Fire Geckos at The Thorn is no joke, you're quite the fighter!
joy|That's a true friend of this wonderful place! Lady Luck shines on you.
anger|We'll get 'em.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
surprise|Bears strong like metal men? Bears stronger now.
disgust|Murderer!
surprise|Holy shit!
anger|Why are you people treating us like this?
anger|They killed her!
fear|I don't know what you have against the Followers, but I don't want any trouble.
joy|That's very generous of you. I appreciate it.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|Hello again. Did you need something else?
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
neutral|Yes, he said he was looking into the water shortage, but I haven't heard back from him. Got the feeling he wasn't here in any official way.
anger|Can't say as I really know. Maybe I'll just ask him why. Maybe I'll punch him right in the mouth.
sadness|Mr. House has everything to do with Vault 21. He tried to get us out before he filled it with concrete.
anger|They killed her!
neutral|Stand tall and walk straight, you idiots are giving us a bad name.
fear|Brought too many bullets and not enough stimpaks!
neutral|Have a good one.
neutral|Imagine two snarling dogs fighting over a curve of bone, perhaps the rib of their master, long-dead.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
joy|You can't hide from me.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
joy|Much appreciated. Once you've talked to them, let me know what they have to say.
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
fear|Bleeding out pretty bad here!
anger|My army has been ready for some time now. My orders were to await the coming of a messenger.
neutral|After the battle, we consolidated our hold on the plant before pursuing our enemies.
neutral|I believe in the NCR, but that doesn't make it right for them to roll over anyone who doesn't want any part of 'em.
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
neutral|Get lost!
anger|I can't believe you've got the gall to stroll down the Strip after what you've done.
joy|Right behind you, boss.
joy|The Legion forces are hurting pretty bad, actually. This is the perfect opportunity for us.
anger|I bet I'd get a reward for bringing your head to the authorities, assassin!
neutral|I don't know what I'm supposed to do about all this.
neutral|This from the guy who walked from I-15 to the Colorado River looking for his lost package.
neutral|Merciless in their assault on the NCR, the Remnants struck fear into the hearts of even the Centurions at Hoover Dam.
joy|Holy shit! Did you hear that Caesar is dead? Maybe we actually have a fighting chance now.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
surprise|I've heard about you.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
disgust|You bastard!
neutral|Rise and shine. You have a big day ahead of you.
surprise|Hello! That broad everyone saw go in the Lucky 38, that was you? Shit.
anger|Had enough?
joy|You're the one who busted those assholes at Gomorrah, huh? Good work!
neutral|See ya.
neutral|Caesar's Legion: Rascal.
anger|Not now!
anger|We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
surprise|Really? Wow. Well, you did pay for them, so here you go. Thanks again for everything.
surprise|Found you!
sadness|Rest in peace, Brother.
neutral|Hellloooo, sparky.
joy|I won't be missing Mr. House, that's a given. The Strip's better off without him.
anger|See, my friends and I, we were kinda wondering if we should give you a good beating right now, or save it for when we catch you outside.
anger|When another legatus or a Centurion fails to achieve results, I send Lanius to make things right.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
neutral|Hey, baby! Over here!
neutral|Okay. This will just take a moment.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
joy|That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
joy|Right on, right on. You're a pretty hip cat.
joy|Guess who won the lottery.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
neutral|Sure enough, you got me clear of this mess. Here you go.
neutral|Ladies, if you wish to bathe, please check into the Ultra-Luxe.
neutral|Primm: Shunned.
surprise|Hey!
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
anger|They killed him!
neutral|You'd need to take out the pack leaders - the Mother Deathclaw and the Deathclaw Alpha Male. Kill 'em, and the pack will scatter. Pretty tough job.
neutral|Want to dance, hit Gomorrah.
joy|I can't wait to see what fights next.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
joy|Excellent, come back after you've spoken to them. They should see the benefits of helping us in the long-term.
joy|Glad to see you haven't gotten yourself killed yet.
joy|Thanks.
anger|Look out!
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
anger|But it sure as hell is going to make me feel better for a little while, and that's all I wanted.
anger|Come on!
neutral|A hundred caps. No kissing, no rough stuff.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
surprise|People of my trade respect the merchants of these territories.
neutral|VStoryEventMonorailDestroyed set to 1.
joy|Baby, wow-ee wow wow! You and me are gonna swing!
neutral|The Followers of the Apocalypse aren't just interested in research. We care for our fellow man and do everything we can to help humanity.
joy|I've got a message for you from Papa Khan. He wants you to return to Red Rock Canyon and speak to him as soon as possible.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
surprise|People lived in here for hundreds of years, can you imagine?
anger|Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
anger|If you want me to split, you could just say so.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
fear|Look out!
neutral|I set up the fights, keep track of prisoners available, and make sure the arena's cleaned up.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
surprise|Aha!
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
anger|What have you done?
joy|My wife and I know the secret to a happy marriage. Two times a week, we go to a nice restaurant. She goes Mondays, I go Fridays.
joy|Not always. I have other places I need to be, but I stop by every few days or so.
neutral|After all the training in virtual reality, the young ones would relish an opportunity to put their skills to battle. We'll be there when you need us.
surprise|The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
joy|Howdy there, partner.
joy|Man, we're only the coolest cats on the whole Strip. We been here the longest, we got the swankiest digs, and we got caps rolling in like the tide.
joy|Thanks to your help, I feel like we can take on the world!
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
disgust|Filthy lowlife scum!
surprise|Grenade!
anger|We're just muscle. Alexander's the man to talk to.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
surprise|Aha!
neutral|That's the news. This is Mr. New Vegas, filling in for Mr. New Vegas.
anger|If you want to get fucked up, Gomorrah's the place to go. Wish I was there now.
neutral|Good to hear. Without access to the sulfur, Cooke doesn't have much to offer the gang. I... I guess it's over, then. We can turn ourselves in.
joy|You've proved yourself useful, at least.
neutral|I want you to head to Red Rock Canyon, north of here. Find Papa Khan and ask him if he'd allow the Powder gangers to join up.
surprise|You've been making a name for yourself around here already.
anger|They killed her!
surprise|Bear has horns? Head voices not see that coming.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
joy|Here's the package - good luck. Your payment will be waiting when you get back.
joy|Which reminds me of something I've been meaning to try. A killer competition to boost morale. Interested?
surprise|Word is the Khans signed a treaty with the NCR. Never saw that coming.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
joy|NCR should take this chance, now that Mr. House's out of the way.
neutral|Lots of little things - the paint on the label, the machining, the type of metal it's made from.
surprise|Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
joy|When I get back home, I'll tell everyone I met you.
neutral|You got it. I'm glad I ran into you. Thanks for the advice.
joy|That Legion boss would've never taken the city, but I'm glad he's a goner.
fear|Leave me alone!
anger|Damn!
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|Shoot first, poke bodies later. Got it, boss.
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
neutral|His latest campaign in the wilds of the Utah has concluded, and he is en route. When he arrives, your doom arrives with him.
neutral|Ah. Well... I suppose we could always find him a place. Maybe doing inventory on the Pre-War Unexploded Munitions Collection back West.
joy|Typical chickenshit commie maneuver.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
joy|After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
anger|Don't talk to me!
neutral|But we really need some good-old red meat on the menu soon, so I'm willing to divert some caps in their direction if they're open to supplying us.
anger|What brings someone like you here?
neutral|I think it is safe to move up.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
surprise|Hey, you're not thinking of going up there, are you?
neutral|We can handle the weapons, we just need extra scrap to melt down for the bullets.
neutral|Leaving so soon? And I thought we'd have time for a little chat.
anger|Even without our President, we won't leave the new territories!
neutral|You ask too much. We barely make a profit as it is.
joy|I wouldn't want you to get any dirt under your fingernails or tarnish your good name or whatever the heck you're so worried about.
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
anger|You'd better get out of here.
anger|Why the hell should I do that?
surprise|Aha!
neutral|Even if it did work, it'd be under NCR control now. So it'd either prove our goals are wrong or we're incapable of pursuing them.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
neutral|The caravans or NCR patrols usually don't stop, but we usually get people like yourself wandering on by a few times a week.
neutral|Talk to Jack, he'd be happy to sell you some top-quality chems. He'll even give you a discount.
joy|And a quick shot... all done.
neutral|Seven years. Took over three days after Mr. House introduced himself.
neutral|Yeah, you're right. For you, and just you, fifty caps. Don't tell anyone.
joy|Another satisfied customer.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
surprise|Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
disgust|Besides, they'd probably start crying as soon as they saw the hostages get so much as a bruise. Nope, they don't got the stomach for it.
anger|All right. I'll let it go - this time.
anger|She's guarding it, I know she is!
neutral|What's going on with the Misfits?
sadness|Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
joy|Right, straight to business. Good. No wonder Caesar sent you.
neutral|"General Wait-and-see," he called him.
anger|I'd kill you right now if I could.
anger|I'll execute Caesar's will by hurling your corpse into the Colorado - like the other Profligates before you!
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
disgust|Harder than you think. I don't want you blowing this, so I'll just hold on to this.
joy|Hey, if you can help, I'll take whatever I can get. Doctor's Bags would be a huge help, but what I really need are medical texts.
anger|That's against regulations!
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
anger|Is there a problem here?
fear|This can't be happening!
anger|You shouldn't be so mean to people!
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
joy|Sweet daisies, here I come!
neutral|As far as I know, it's just me and my crew out here, and if it really was Great Khans who mugged you, they didn't come this way. I'd have seen 'em.
joy|Here's your stuff back - in case Benny don't go quiet, you dig? I'll tell the boys to give you a pass to pack some heat.
neutral|Can barely see the street.
fear|Also, I might have... umm... sort of... plowed his daughter. A little.
neutral|VStoryEventSecuritronsFort set to 1.
joy|Funny robot make blinky sounds.
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
anger|We make regular shipments to a lot of settlements around the Mojave - a lot of our business comes from the Fiends lately.
surprise|What?
neutral|It is obvious to you that I built this place? The Platinum Chip opened it, after all?
anger|Some idiot decided it would be funny to put up graffiti all over the Strip. If I find out it was one of my men, they'll be locked up for a month.
anger|I don't know who the fuck you think you are, but this is my gate and I'm the gatekeeper.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
neutral|I don't know. I don't know. We'd need something that shows the Brotherhood will fail. Or that it can do better a different way.
surprise|Glad that fucker House is gone.
disgust|Better not try that again.
anger|I can't do that, baby, and you know it. There's a lot of angles to this caper - complexities aplenty.
anger|The Legion will pay for this.
neutral|Good work, stranger. The Thorn will nurture these eggs until their hatchlings are ready to bleed for us.
joy|Those medical supplies have already been a phenomenal help. Thank you.
surprise|My search routines are quite advanced, don't you think?
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|I need you to uncover what they're up to, and stop it if it threatens the NCR. Any questions?
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
neutral|Thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
surprise|Weird, someone just told me that the Khans split the Vegas area. Wonder where they went, and why.
neutral|One more story for you...
neutral|The Nociception Regulator modifies your cardiovascular system, and you won't tire as quickly. The price is 4,000 caps, same as most other implants.
anger|Goddamn it! Don't sneak up on me like that. What do you want?
surprise|What are you doing here? This is our casino, punk.
anger|Yeah, okay... I'll shoot the lock off the door and... and then.... Argh, dammit!
neutral|No problem.
surprise|... It's all me, isn't it? The pain, the anger, my joy, all of that's just me.
neutral|I don't believe it. Who the hell are you, lady? How did you just walk right up and pull him out of there?
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
anger|I got my eye on you. Even if it doesn't see so good.
anger|Stop acting so rambunctious, you naughty, naughty children!
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
joy|And maybe they are, since you managed to show up at just the right time.
joy|I'd have better luck with the Legion's ears. Heh, get it? Legion ears?
anger|What the hell?!
neutral|The attacks are all the more troubling since there has not been a zoo in the area in quite some time.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
surprise|Not very often we see civilians on-base. What's you're story?
joy|Until next time.
sadness|The one researcher I liked who I could chat up about liquor got transferred, and the rest of the docs are pretty uptight about my kind of fun.
fear|Forlorn Hope was massacrated. How are the troops going to defend poor sobs like us?
neutral|First NCR Recon. It's a sniper battalion. Sees a lot of action.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
anger|Don't talk to me!
surprise|We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
surprise|Huh?
anger|Flank 'em!
neutral|Move up to the next position.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|Gonna play a song for you right now. It's about that special someone you only find once... in a Blue Moon.
anger|Let's kick this in gear.
joy|Ah hah!
joy|It's great to be here at the Tops, folks. The room I'm in has a lovely little closet. A nail.
surprise|Hey!
surprise|Found you!
neutral|Those last five shots were a bad idea...
anger|Don't worry, you'll get the Platinum Chip he was carrying. And then you'll use it like I tell you to.
neutral|I swear... I'm not drinking... ever... again.
joy|Feel better? You should, that was the good stuff. Need anything else?
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
anger|
anger|Don't talk to me!
fear|This can't be happening!
joy|Here you go. Thanks, I owe you big time.
joy|All right. <Cracks knuckles>
joy|I hear we got reinforced by the troops that were in Boulder City. It's good to have some extra support around here.
surprise|The molerat men! They've come for my beard at last! Oh. Never mind.
neutral|NCR Rangers are being pulled off the front lines as part of a campaign to "secure existing NCR territory," according to anonymous sources.
neutral|Don't have the patience for this drunk escort shit tonight...
joy|Excellent. You'd think living in the lap of luxury and power would be enough for some people, but no.
fear|I had no idea there was such a thing as a friendly Nightkin. Look at that thing.
neutral|In the meantime, however, I have something else I want you to look into.
surprise|Thank God. I hoped someone would come eventually, but where are the rest of your men?
joy|You really think so? Hell, I guess it's worth a shot.
neutral|I'm a Slavemaster, so I know what I'm talking about. Back at the Fort, I'd have those three half-broken and well on their way.
anger|Watch yourself, we got hit by a Legion raiding party just the other night.
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
surprise|Huh?
anger|What have you done?
surprise|I guess that explains how you're still alive. You're built solid as an oak.
surprise|Hey wait! I just remembered something. I might of heard one of the guys that attacked us call another by name.
neutral|Sure, Baldie wants you to go down in the bunker and destroy whatever Mr. House stashed there.
joy|NCR came all the way to save us, huh? Guess they missed the shit-holes.
anger|Now take the Platinum Chip, go to the bunker or whatever it is, and destroy whatever gizmo-happy Brahmin shit you find down there.
joy|I'm glad to see you.
sadness|I lost everything I had at The Tops, but if you gave me 500 caps, I'd head straight back. Sick, huh?
sadness|There was a communication mix-up that resulted in some noncombatants being killed. It was a tragic mistake, but we've done all we can to make amends.
anger|Good riddance.
anger|I've got to deal with drunk troopers making fools of themselves and embarassing all of the NCR with their behavior, so it's just another day here.
disgust|I'm sure the others have their own ideas, though.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
neutral|When asked why, the source said someone alerted them to the fact that Caesar's Legion was comprised of, quote, a bunch of squares.
neutral|Wait right there. I don't recall seeing your pretty face before - what do you want?
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
joy|Stories of how you saved President Kimball are the talk of the Strip, friend!
joy|Holy shit those NCR Rangers are badass! I wish I was that cool.
fear|I don't want any trouble, okay?
joy|I really hope that incident at REPCONN doesn't drive people away. Novac was starting to do well!
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
neutral|Why, then, do you keep asking?
anger|There will be no failure this time, no retreat, no years of gathering slaves and resources for another assault.
neutral|Yeah, guess the roads must've been long, then, if you forgot where you started from.
disgust|Damn Brahmin crap everywhere.
disgust|Then again... our expert is an idiot. Hell, he might as well be a saboteur. I guess you couldn't do any worse.
joy|Good to see a friend of our government.
neutral|True to Caesar.
neutral|Now that's a delivery service you can count on.
joy|Sure thing.
neutral|<whuff>
joy|Do that again!
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
neutral|To rearm the mine, we'd just press the button again - simple. The Profligates will regret that we learned this.
neutral|Not even a hint, huh? Geez, I really am all alone on this one.
neutral|Boring as hell, but it was his money and his time, so I let him talk about whatever.
neutral|Looks like we got them, move fast and look alive.
anger|Nobody screws with the Gun Runners and walks away from it!
joy|If you ever get your hands on a piece of sweet, deadly hardware, there's a good chance that it came from one of our factories.
disgust|Don't dump your Ghoul here, we've already got enough shit around us.
joy|Us NCR folk got to stick together, even if the Strip is the safest place in New Vegas.
disgust|If a reward is all you're concerned with, here. Enjoy it.
neutral|You've got yourself a deal.
joy|You're the one who busted those assholes at Gomorrah, huh? Good work!
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
joy|Why would I do that, baby? I want to talk to you as much as you want to talk to me.
anger|And we're all done. That wasn't so bad, was it? Did you need anything else?
disgust|If you perform too poorly, they'll scrub you out. Perform too well, and you get sent to the front lines.
neutral|You laid the foundation for my victory, so fine - I'll permit some latitude in how you schedule your work.
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
neutral|I've been working with her in this investigation.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
sadness|I just can't believe it... the President's dead. It doesn't even feel real.
neutral|Here, this is edible.
neutral|No one knows. Money? Weapons? Water? It is, or maybe was, something of value, and that's enough to get people motivated.
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
surprise|Sounds like the NCR and the Legion are both gearing up for a fight. Been seeing a lot more soldiers around.
anger|On the Strip, everyone's nice to you when you got the caps. The moment you don't? They throw your ass out.
surprise|All right, you drive a hard bargain, baby. Tell you what, I'll bump him up to 3,000. That's fair. Here's your cut.
neutral|It's not a requirement to be a Follower to enter the university, but I believe in what they do, so I joined them.
surprise|Right on, let's have it!
neutral|They are, shall we say, aggressively reclusive? They have several howitzers they fire at anyone who dares approach the base.
joy|You've been quite difficult to predict, my friend. I hope I can sway you more solidly to the Legion's way of thinking.
neutral|It was a mistake, to be sure, but there wasn't really any place for them to go. When we finally gave chase, however, they had simply vanished.
neutral|I wouldn't eat or drink them, but no, they won't explode if you drop them or anything.
surprise|Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
joy|There once was a fellow called Garret,
neutral|All right, you're clean. Come back by here when you're done at the tables.
neutral|Oh yeah? What for?
anger|You can't hide from your paddling!
neutral|We'll see about that.
neutral|Had me send a request to the Express office in Hub, for seven couriers to be hired. Each one to carry bric-a-brac, seemed to me!
neutral|Oh, because that makes it so much better! Get out of my sight, I have nothing to say to you any more!
joy|Now, you see, you should have opened with that. I'll sell you his contract, but it will cost you.
anger|This is unacceptable, we demand the immediate return of our power armor.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
anger|I don't trust those creeps at the Ultra-Luxe.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
neutral|VStoryEventMonorailDestroyed set to 0.
joy|Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
anger|Let me know it's him by putting on the beret I gave you. That's it. Now go on.
anger|Come for me then. Flails of God!
neutral|Goodnight.
surprise|Hey!
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
neutral|We're an independent group. We take care of our own and don't take crap from anybody, especially the NCR.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
fear|What do you want with me?
neutral|We need to stop and pee soon.
neutral|Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
anger|I only work for caravans, all right? Try someone else.
joy|That Fiend leader got what he fucking deserved.
surprise|Aha!
anger|I don't get you. Sometimes you help the Followers, and other times you work against us.
fear|This vault gives me the creeps.
joy|Us NCR folk got to stick together, even if the Strip is the safest place in New Vegas.
neutral|Good luck.
neutral|Bullshit. You're holding, you just want it all for yourself!
anger|So why don't you just leave me alone.
sadness|Rest in peace, Brother.
joy|Good to see a friend of our government.
joy|You're a scrapper, baby. They didn't stand a chance. How about me?
anger|Do you think that men go bald normally? I am sick, and I have embraced my change. Leave me be.
surprise|What, you see a scorpion?
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
anger|Time to die!
neutral|Because Marcus asked me to and because it's a reason for me to get up in the morning. I'd like to get one more grand accomplishment done.
joy|REPCONN scientists were pioneers in fission-based propulsion systems, and have recently had some very exciting breakthroughs with plasma systems.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
anger|Grrrraah!
sadness|Can't go anywhere else.
anger|That caused an uproar. But I said "the name sticks." Ciao to the old ways, baby - time to swing in style. If the shoes fit, you wear them.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
fear|What do you want?
neutral|You're making me question your usefulness, you realize.
neutral|What's going on with the Great Khans?
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
neutral|Sure. What did you want to know?
neutral|Trade routes, my friend, trade routes. Just about every major town in the wasteland has a Crimson Caravan branch in it.
joy|It's cramped in here, sure, but who really needs a fancy room, anyway?
joy|You do well to serve the Legion.
anger|I'm a little ashamed to admit it, but a part of me would really love to get my hands on the bastard that killed the President.
sadness|Doctor's Bags would be a huge help too.
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
neutral|And don't get any dreamy notions about playing the hero and dragging those boys out. You'll get swarmed. Now let's go.
disgust|Murderer!
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
neutral|The Brotherhood is failing. I've always known that. If we don't change course, we're going to fall apart or... fade away.
neutral|If I turn out to be a burden, we can part ways at any time. No hard feelings.
disgust|You're just pulling my leg, right? Why would anyone... uh... never mind. Anyway...
joy|I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
neutral|Can barely see the street.
neutral|We constantly replenish our stock to keep this holy ground soaked red. Only a few brave ones ever earn the honor of serving The Thorn.
joy|Better that you don't.
disgust|Right. You have trouble even saying the word "bad". Go on, get out of here if you know what's good for you.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
sadness|I wish I was stationed at McCarran. I heard they still get to hit the Strip for R&R. We haven't had R&R in ages.
anger|Good riddance, Mojave.
neutral|Suit yourself.
neutral|They're mentally flexible. They operate behind enemy lines for extended periods, imitating the enemy's customs without becoming sullied.
neutral|If there's nothing else, then let's get moving.
disgust|Oh, great, like I don't have enough problems!
neutral|Fuck off. You already screwed me once, and it's not happening again.
surprise|What? Hey, guys! Help me here!
joy|Man, I love my guns.
neutral|Indeed, our hounds demonstrate greater loyalty to each other every day than the wretched inhabitants of this town.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
disgust|I know he's a coward, hiding behind an army of robots, ensconced in that tower of his like a wizard in one of those Grognak comic books.
neutral|Can't believe we have patrol duty in the morning...
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
anger|What the hell?!
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
neutral|Hey, welcome to Red Rock Canyon! Since you've done so much for the Great Khans, Papa Khan told me to let you know you can buy weapons at our Armory.
anger|You want to go down there and try to haul those crippled boys off those poles, you're dumber than you look.
anger|I knew from the start I'd need to eradicate this plague of tribal identities, replacing them with a monolithic culture, a uniform identity.
neutral|They reminded me of a certain criminal element Vegas used to attract. I told them some stories, gave them some clothes - and they ran with it.
anger|I prefer the term "relocated."
anger|There's more of them still out there.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
joy|We got everything you could want - slot machines in the back, cards and roulette in the front, fine entertainment upstairs in the Aces Theater.
joy|I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
neutral|Caesar thinks he can change human nature. Most of the Legion is following Caesar, not Caesar's ideals. When he's gone, it'll crumble.
surprise|Found you!
disgust|Murderer!
fear|Look, we'll be happy to sell you any chems you want, just don't do anything crazy, okay?
anger|Life among humans again, that's what you're suggesting?
anger|Hmm, join the Great Khans or die in the wasteland? Good fucking plan Cooke.
neutral|It's ghouls, I tell ya. Religious ghouls in rockets looking for a land to call their own.
fear|Why's that tower on the Strip all fucking lit up now, huh? I don't like it.
sadness|It's hard to stay awake on watch with only a few hours of sleep. I wish we actually had time to rest around here.
anger|There's nothing up here.
anger|Guess my eyes weren't playing tricks after all!
neutral|Forget I said anything, then.
neutral|You are such a wimp! Die!
surprise|The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
neutral|Yeah, I guess you're right. Here.
neutral|I saw some Legion assholes carrying crates to a cave north of here. May have been NCR shit, I don't fucking know.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|Wretched Profligate. Try making some trouble.
disgust|Oh look, it's the conformist tool.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
anger|Why! Won't! You! Behave?!
surprise|You would? You really would?
joy|I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
anger|Fighting was part of my studies.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
joy|I can't believe you're talking to me, this is so cool! I mean, uh... dude, what's up?
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
joy|There's a Ranger Station run by ghouls? Finally, I feel like I have a place to go. Thanks for your help.
neutral|Sounds like the evidence we need to bring him in for questioning and search his shack, but why are you telling me all of this?
neutral|I should never have worked with you in the first place.
sadness|If you're sure... your loss.
joy|That Caesar bastard had it coming.
joy|You'd do that for me, baby? Don't tease if you don't mean it.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|New Vegas, paradise, my ass.
joy|Don't be alarmed if I try to kill you when I find you. It's just the way I've been programmed.
anger|Flank 'em!
neutral|Fine. Just do me a favor. If you find more of those things, and plan on keeping them, watch out for a man named Allen Marks.
anger|Look out!
neutral|Very well.
neutral|Recently, one of my roaming Securitrons observed a man near the base studying the pattern of its artillery fire. Maybe he's learned something.
surprise|No! That's not what I meant! I-
anger|For Caesar!
anger|Find that officer and give him this old map of our patrol routes. The Profligates will try to set up ambushes... and we'll be waiting for them.
joy|I'm doing the best I can considering the poor situation I find myself in.
surprise|A flying robot? Man, I must be fucked up.
anger|I'm no Legionary, but I'll kill you all the same!
neutral|Primm: Vilified.
neutral|Not a chance.
anger|And I've heard it's a bad idea to tempt the wrath of Caesar. Change the subject.
joy|Another glorious day in the U.S. army!
anger|Locked and loaded!
neutral|It would mean more people better protected and able to fight.
anger|You're just as bad as the NCR or the Legion. What did the Followers ever do to you?
fear|If I have to pull another double shift again I'm going to collapse from exhaustion.
neutral|They defended HELIOS like it was their last stand. Didn't even know if there was anything worth defending. How could there be, with all we lost?
anger|Come on!
sadness|I don't want to talk to you! I hate you!
neutral|That's a shame. Well, let me know if you change your mind or those Legion sons of bitches will be holed up in Nelson for weeks.
neutral|Bye.
surprise|Grenade!
surprise|I... very well. If that's what you want, that's what we'll do.
joy|Good. Why don't you walk down to the end of the room? Over by that vigor tester machine there.
anger|These troops did a good job holding off the Legion. Now it's time to fight back.
anger|I bet I'd get a reward for bringing your head to the authorities, assassin!
sadness|The Legion has been hitting us pretty hard lately. Lots of casualties, not many people I can save.
neutral|But he started having disagreements with the other Elders. The Brotherhood's interest is in old technology. He wanted to explore developing new tech.
neutral|The situation being what it is, we can't afford to lose even a single man unnecessarily.
surprise|What? Are you... serious? Well, I'm not complaining, hon.
neutral|Of course my child. After all that you have done for us we would love to help you in the upcoming battle.
joy|Thanks.
fear|Looks like Mr. House run out of luck, huh?
disgust|Better not try that again.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
disgust|Well I'm glad I have your approval.
neutral|NCR Correctional Facility is now under prisoner control following a successful riot. Locals should avoid anyone who looks like they've done time.
neutral|Goodsprings has fended off a mob of escaped convicts after organizing an impromptu militia, according to an old man armed to the teeth with dynamite.
surprise|Hey, think you can walk around here like nothing's happened?
neutral|I'd always be reminded of this day. How I wasn't strong enough to stand by them.
joy|Excellent. As you can see, we have a lot of injured troopers here and I haven't had time to look at all of them yet.
anger|Name's Logan. What the hell do you want?
neutral|You better make it worthwhile. I ain't going to risk my neck in The Wasteland for shit.
joy|I'll meet you there. Good luck.
surprise|I still can't believe the King agreed to work with the NCR. But he's the King, and the King knows best.
neutral|Where's your sexy friend, Vic?!
neutral|I don't have much in the way of money, but I'd be willing to share the secret of the recipe.
joy|Nice work at the Tops buddy.
joy|Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
neutral|There are other Ranger posts around. Reyes might have mixed up the report.
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
neutral|Wow. Good thing the safety was on.
anger|You're lucky we Followers tend to be forgiving.
fear|Please no!
joy|Good to see a friend of our government.
neutral|You may find one in the workshop. You're a friend to the tribe, so I trust it will not find it's way into the wrong hands.
neutral|I could do that. You're not interested in coming along? Hate to break up the band over a silly little thing like the future of everyone I care about.
joy|Want to see the best of New Vegas? Our sewers got it - The Thorn!
anger|Just keep on walking.
fear|The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
surprise|Maybe they just... went home, huh boss?
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
joy|Another satisfied customer.
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
surprise|I... I didn't think it showed. I guess that it's worse than I thought.
joy|Here kitty-kitty-kitty!
anger|It says that we are to protect humanity from them at all costs.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
sadness|The surface world is a cruel place.
anger|Let's get going, we don't have much time.
neutral|A crushing, decisive victory of this sort would overshadow the tactical ingenuity of Chief Hanlon's defense four years ago, you see.
neutral|Watch out for Great Khans.
surprise|Aha!
joy|There it is! Thanks lady, you're the greatest.
joy|Nice try. Let's play another game.
joy|I'm glad to see you.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
fear|If you survive, you're in.
surprise|Hey!
neutral|Thanks, that'll help.
anger|That's not a good idea.
neutral|No, we have men to outfit and are putting it to good use.
neutral|The Strip: Rascal.
joy|Nice work at the Tops buddy.
anger|There's more of them still out there.
surprise|Look at that - a friendly Nightkin. What's it doing here?
joy|Good riddance, Caesar! We can finally enjoy some R&R without worrying about a Legion attack at McCarran.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
neutral|No, man. That's just what I'm supposed to do.
anger|Next time, I'll put a nail in your head.
sadness|The Major let me send out some troops to gather supplies, but unfortunately they never returned. I'm guessing they ran into some trouble on the way.
disgust|Better not try that again.
neutral|They're cannibals, slavers, and worse.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
neutral|Agreed. If we take the power plant, this battle is over. I'll have my men focus their efforts there. May the Son of Mars go with you.
fear|Okay. Keep me posted.
neutral|He should really mind his own business. Crandon's good to keep scum in check, but he ain't exactly subtle.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
surprise|Surrender. You don't seriously think that you can take on my crew, do you?
surprise|You think me a fool? We wouldn't hire an outsider to deal with a traitor.
anger|That's right. Under normal circumstances, the reason it wouldn't happen again is that you'd be crucified - or worse.
anger|Flank 'em!
neutral|Without access to the sulfur, he'll lose what influence he has left with the men here.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
anger|Yeah, give me what you got.
joy|Woof! If you're not the most sarcastic dame I ever met, your standards are so low they could use you at the Annual Gomorrah Saucy Limbo Competition.
sadness|Why did you run away? I'm really not as scary as I look.
neutral|Ever since he lost his job a few years back he hasn't been the same. He took a switch to us for the tiniest things.
neutral|Uh oooooh, it's the *law,* girls!
anger|You dirty coward!
neutral|It's a targeting device for some kind of doomsday weapon based at HELIOS One. It was lost sometime after the War.
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
surprise|They offer me a roof over my head and half a Fancy Lad and I'll fold like a classy napkin.
surprise|Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
joy|Hey everybody, look who it is! Glad to have you here friend. What can I do for you?
joy|To restore the bomber, to fly the open skies in armored safety, raining high-explosive ordnance upon ignorant savages - this is our destiny!
anger|What?... Those bastards! Selling folks off to the Fiends? Selling children - to Cook-Cook...?
sadness|Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for the missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured soldiers.
disgust|We were savages. The Legion raised us up, made us better than what we were.
sadness|Rest in peace, Brother.
neutral|Here, this is the key to their collars. You'll want to take those off before you go far, trust me.
surprise|I still can't believe the King agreed to work with the NCR. But he's the King, and the King knows best.
neutral|I just wanted to provide for my family - and now they're gone. All gone. God forgive me....
anger|You killed him! What kind of Doctor are you? Get out of here now!
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
anger|What was that for?
neutral|I suppose.
surprise|We were nomadic badasses, not to be trifled with. A gang of ruffians, though with a certain panache.
neutral|Don't think your servile gesture earns my respect, stranger. But if that's how you want it, so it'll be.
joy|Now we can actually try to strengthen our forces along the river and prepare for the upcoming battle at Hoover Dam.
anger|Flank 'em!
neutral|Hmmm... I've got my eye on you. Get the fuck off my turf.
neutral|VStoryEventBennyKilledFort to 0.
anger|I knew you wouldn't understand! You haven't been here! You haven't been through all the horrors that we go through every day!
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
surprise|All hell broke loose when the creatures escaped from The Thorn!
sadness|Who isn't in trouble in New Vegas, uh? Sooner or later, you hit the bottom of the barrel - I just happened to fall harder than most, is all.
anger|What was that for?
joy|When the NCR came to the Mojave, we thought they would be easy pickings. We raided their caravans, their towns, their camps - they couldn't stop us.
neutral|I called them family before. That's not far off. Both the good and the bad. It's like a big unending family reunion in that bunker.
joy|We make the happy stuff. What do you need? Jet, Psycho, a little Med-X to ease the pain?
neutral|Most of the time it's some young Legionary trying to make a name for himself, hoping to get noticed by Caesar or the Praetorians.
neutral|No, no, no - they haven't yet earned the right to be called "slaves"! Those three in the pen are captures, nothing more.
neutral|However, be warned. Aggressive acts against us will earn you a place on a cross.
surprise|I heard it got nasty at the Tops; wish I could've seen the shooting.
disgust|Um. Yeah. Please go away.
disgust|But here everything is huge and threatening - so empty that I think one of these days I'll just... snap.
anger|That's not a good idea.
surprise|Wow, I'm actually still alive. Who would have guessed?
anger|Look out!
joy|Those Legion beasts needed to be put down, like the vermin they are!
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
disgust|You must be bloody stupid if you can't hide from me.
surprise|Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
sadness|Dammit! You're going to leave me hanging, uh? Don't know how else I can get her back.
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
sadness|There's no way I can take on the Legion by myself. I'll be here if you change your mind.
neutral|Then came the crucifixions. Goddamn but those went on and on and on...
disgust|This whole area used to be a Great Khan encampment before they relocated to Red Rock Canyon. We just haven't had the manpower to clean it all up yet.
surprise|Hey, you're the one that's been hunting the most dangerous beasts for The Thorn!
anger|Our main targets are the Legion leaders at Nelson. I've uploaded their last known locations to your Pip-Boy.
neutral|For a pittance, the town agreed to lead those it had sheltered into a trap. Only when I sprang it did they realize they were caught inside it, too.
neutral|One of these days I'll get some boys out to the turbine to get it running again, but right now it is pretty low on the priority list.
neutral|VStoryEventKhans set to 1.
neutral|Thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
neutral|You think Alice cares about her family? Tell her, then. Family's what drove her to me in the first place.
fear|He... does? Wait, this changes everything. I can't leave my girls here... and, where would we go even if we escape?
neutral|Goddamn it. We could've gotten them out.
anger|What have you done?
joy|So why don't you just turn your butt around and scoot back down the road before I blast some daylight through you?
neutral|We're a tiny splinter from a shrinking group. We don't take on new members. But we're still picking fights with the big boys.
sadness|Yeah, well, I guess maybe I'm not. But what else can I do?
disgust|Didn't you hear me coming? Now I have to fight you. Bloody fantastic.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
surprise|Whoa, easy there. Easy. You been out cold a couple of days now.
neutral|Come on, come on.
surprise|Aha!
joy|Good. The President doesn't arrive until tomorrow. Get some rest, I'll brief you in the morning.
joy|However, you can take this status report back to Major Polatli. It's a very important task and I think I can count on you.
surprise|Whoa!
joy|And a quick shot... all done.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
neutral|Dismissed.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
joy|I've got this recipe for a Deathclaw Omelet that I've been itching to try out. Trouble is - I need a Deathclaw egg. Kinda obvious, I suppose.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
fear|A bunch of units just got mobilized to Hoover Dam. This is the big one, isn't it?
joy|Now that you've killed that Caesar bastard, the Strip's really going to bloom!
joy|No way I'm going back to prison.
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
fear|Are you sure about that?
anger|Baby, you can savor the swank digs all you want when we're done talking. Sit down.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
sadness|I sat down at a roulette table with my life savings. An hour later, it was gone.
neutral|Other things weren't lost, but were blocked from our collective memory. Knowledge of what we're capable of, and how things spiral out of control.
anger|You better be sleeping with one eye open.
anger|Got 'em in my sights!
surprise|My conquest of the Mojave will be a glorious triumph, marking the transition of the Legion from a basically nomadic tribe to a genuine empire.
surprise|Damn, be careful with those things!
disgust|Filthy lowlife scum!
anger|Don't see a thing.
joy|What's new?
fear|We're all going to die out here. They're out there right now, waiting for us... waiting to kill us.
neutral|Why do they call it a monorail... it's a train. A *train.*
joy|Oh, it's a fine place. The lake is real pretty, and we don't get bothered much by them Legion fellers.
neutral|Sorry, but I need it to shoot Stacey. We can find you another gun.
joy|Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
disgust|Better not try that again.
surprise|Hey!
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
anger|You and I have got nothing to talk about.
joy|It's amazing that Kimball managed to survive.
disgust|You will regret this.
joy|NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
fear|What!? No, please! Here, take the caps but please don't hurt me!
anger|I'm not going to talk to you!
anger|I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
neutral|So long, stranger.
sadness|We don't get many supplies out here, but I can offer you some caps and maybe some old gear.
anger|I'm no Legionary, but I'll kill you all the same!
disgust|Step forward and identify yourself!
neutral|Eyewitnesses outside Camp McCarran are reporting a large explosion near its monorail station. The NCR is denying the incident.
neutral|The great one can be found upstairs. Don't think about wasting his time. He's very important. You should feel lucky to be granted some of his time.
fear|Get back!
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
neutral|Momma...
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
neutral|The world has no use for emotionally unstable techno-fetishists. Just wipe them out, will you?
anger|The time for talk has passed, honey baby. These mouths of ours have appointments to be elsewhere.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
joy|Fuck that Caesar dog! I'm going to drink in your name, all night!
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
neutral|Have a word with her, see what she says. I daresay she'll be more receptive with these new developments.
anger|Ready to die for your country?
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
neutral|I just didn't expect that. There was no getting through to him.
disgust|Heard you the first time, no need to repeat yourself.
anger|Yeah, real popular around here. It's a crowd pleaser.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
anger|They're late. I hope they've got a good excuse.
joy|It's good to have a friend of the NCR here. What can I do for you?
neutral|My contubernium came up through one of the intake towers ahead and headed east, taking the NCR fools unawares from behind.
surprise|Whoa!
joy|Good to see you around. Take care, merc.
joy|Okay. Hold still. I don't want to make this any more painful than it already is.
joy|Impressive, aren't they? You don't see anything like this outside of NCR territory, that's for sure.
joy|Sure. What do you need?
joy|Hi. How are you today?
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
joy|Don't think too hard, you'll hurt yourself.
neutral|Sources report the NCR's top Ranger, Chief Hanlon, has unexpectedly passed away. NCR soldiers rallied to show their support for the officer.
sadness|I'm afraid that kind of behavior can't be tolerated.
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
surprise|The Great Khans? Oh, you mean those raiders that used to clash with the Vegas tribes?
joy|Know what? I'm going to sign you up anyway. If you don't mind being last then there's not much else I can say. Any questions?
surprise|Word is those tough guys rangers are here. I ain't seen them myself, but how scary can they be?
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
sadness|That's too bad. I need it for the ceremony. I need to look my best and I need my lucky helmet.
joy|Sure, baby, sure. Tommy's always looking for new talent to bring to the Aces.
neutral|Get some sleep. You got a big day ahead of you.
anger|You back again, huh? We missed you, we've been waiting for you. Bet you've missed us too.
neutral|Ah, hell. Well, how could you know, right? Okay. Two other options still on the table.
neutral|Arrogance was their undoing. There might be a lesson in that. But moving on...
surprise|The Khans used to be a big deal around here, but look at them now. There's talk that they were all killed up in the mountains.
neutral|Thought my time had come. For a minute there everything made sense. I could feel the end coming. I was ready for it.
neutral|What? Why the hell would you do that? Are you insane?
joy|If there's anything I learned as a Follower of the Apocalypse, it's that there's a lot of good information in old books.
neutral|But it didn't make any difference.
surprise|Hey, how'd you like to do something for me?
anger|Better be rocksalt in that, or you're asking for an asskicking.
surprise|That wasn't you, was it.
anger|Please. Camp Golf is where they shuffle off anybody they don't want any more. Assignment here is a career ender.
fear|Don't get cocky, the Fiends are twitchy. Most of them won't bother a Khan, but the ones outside the Vault... well, they're outside for a reason.
anger|We'll get 'em.
neutral|Those are the risks of a hunter's life. I've delivered as promised, but perhaps I should better search for someone with greater resolve and honor?
neutral|Maybe not. Maybe I wouldn't have either at one point. But that's why they train you. Break you down till you're automatic.
neutral|I don't believe you. This key has to have been stolen.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
neutral|Pretty sure, yeah. it's really nice, isn't it? Have you ever seen caps with pretty blue stars on them like these?
neutral|Witnesses report a huge object or creature surfacing in Lake Mead. So far, photos of the so-called Lake Mead Monster are grainy and underexposed.
anger|No!
neutral|We took our sweet ass time setting up in Nelson and the Legion managed to hop over the Colorado and attack before things were settled.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
surprise|I've never a dog like that. Who thinks up these things?
neutral|They may be a bunch of wooden conformists, but anything I did without them would feel... empty.
anger|Well, keep those eyes up and turning - or I'll set 'em spinning.
surprise|Glad that fucker House is gone.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
anger|You think you can take me, punk?
sadness|With all the Legion raids lately, we're running low on troops that can still fight. Some are injured, but even more are dead.
neutral|In any case, you're here. So let's get to it.
neutral|Later.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
neutral|I highly doubt that. You'd do well to report only facts to me, otherwise we might have ourselves a problem.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
disgust|You're looking at the second place winner of the Nipton lottery! That asshole Swanick took first place, so him they let walk!
anger|I thought the dam was boring. Then they stuck us out here to watch over this scrap heap.
joy|Feel better? You should, that was the good stuff. Need anything else?
anger|Grandma sees you!
joy|Until next time.
anger|We now have a chance to take the fight to those bastards on their home turf.
joy|You're welcome. Enjoy.
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
neutral|We will never work together again.
surprise|Holy shit!
joy|It's from Ambassador Crocker. Very important. Here you go.
neutral|Once again, Caesar, dead. A shocking turn of events whose impact is anyone's guess at this point.
neutral|That looks like all of them.
fear|Aaaah!
joy|Yep, that's a pretty standard score there. But after what you been through, I'd say that's great news.
neutral|I was out on patrol at the time so I wasn't in the camp when it happened.
surprise|If the Legion can equip their men so well, maybe they can take care of me too.
neutral|He's got no resources but a decent cause. We've got plenty of resources and a totally lost cause.
surprise|Holy shit!
joy|Here are some caps for your trouble. You've done us a great service.
fear|Papa's announced that if Caesar goes to war against the NCR, the Khans will go with him.
fear|The whole area is irradiated and filled with mutated creatures.
neutral|Our lives, our decision to make. We're tired of sitting around in Jacobstown waiting for a cure.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
joy|Did you hear? Gomorrah's under new management!
anger|Fighting was part of my studies.
anger|No!
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
joy|That's more like it. The people can pick up their extra ammo and leather armor when they're ready. Was there anything else?
joy|Whatever you say, boss.
surprise|Aha!
neutral|The brass have been throwing around the idea of having the president visit the dam for a while now. To rally the troops and boost morale and such.
joy|Looks like that's his vertibird coming right now. It's show time, let's not mess this up.
neutral|But I'm not there much anymore. I'm usually out here picking up food and supplies for my family. Whatever they need.
neutral|Where's your sexy friend, Vic?!
neutral|Color me unconvinced. The safe bet is to cash you out.
neutral|I've never seen anything quite like it, but I can tell you it looks like it was fabricated before the War, and not at a mint.
surprise|Everyone's talking about Hoover Dam nowadays. I wish the battle would just happen already. The suspense is killing me.
anger|We're watching you... stranger!
joy|You've just fucked up, big time!
joy|Nice work at the Tops, buddy.
anger|If I hear one more loser moan about losing everything they own on the Strip, I may shoot him in the head.
anger|Got time to save us too, or are you running errands for your NCR masters?
surprise|What are you doing up here?
fear|Running out of friends...
surprise|Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
joy|To start, I'll comp you the Presidential - best suite in the house. You deserve a taste of the VIP lifestyle.
surprise|Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
surprise|Molerat men, come up from the Underneath to steal young women with promises of riches and fancy mud mansions with all the latest designer appliances.
joy|I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|The location of some radiation suits. I found an inventory list that says they should be here but I can't seem to find them anywhere.
anger|Somebody find me something to shoot at!
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
sadness|Won't ever make enough to live outside.
disgust|You want to send an elderly, half-decrepit ghoul into combat? Your tactical brilliance is unmatched, boss.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
joy|Enjoy the show, and don't give us a reason to shoot you, okay?
neutral|Perhaps a partnership in the co-op would be enough. Say, ten percent of daily profits?
disgust|Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
neutral|Looks like we got them, move fast and look alive.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
neutral|Watch yourself with this.
anger|You make me sick, you worthless scumbag.
anger|I admire your bravery, but coming down here after what you've done is just foolish. So be it, Legion dog!
neutral|Had a funny collar on. I wanted to ask him about it but I figured maybe I'd regret asking. People are weird around here.
neutral|Very well. You may proceed.
neutral|Yeah, it does. But we got these bastards pretty good today.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
anger|They killed her!
joy|I really hope that incident at REPCONN doesn't drive people away. Novac was starting to do well!
neutral|You'd think they'd all have been picked clean by now, but somehow new bottles keep appearing in the machines.
neutral|All right, if you want.
disgust|Well, it's not like I'm super-attached to working with Caesar or anything, but if it'll stop his patrols from harassing my runners, I'm all for it.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
joy|Benny tried to sell me a story, but Lucius has a way coaxing the truth out of captives. Everything just comes spilling out.
anger|Had enough?
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
anger|I'd kill you right now if I could.
neutral|Talk to Jack, he'd be happy to sell you some top-quality chems. He'll even give you a discount.
neutral|Please, just... don't let them shut down the co-op.
neutral|Fool. Your deeds are known well among us.
neutral|However, be warned. Aggressive acts against us will earn you a place on a cross.
neutral|Turning it on. Urgh... feels strange. Strange but good.
disgust|They think they have the right to annex every inch of dirt in the West and force their system on every man, woman, and child.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
disgust|Must we play hide and seek now?
anger|But-
anger|We will find you!
sadness|The Tops is a real snooze fest. I hope they get some new shows soon.
joy|The maize is doing well in this soil.
neutral|Lily already has a pre-existing condition, and the experiment will likely make things worse for her.
neutral|<snuffle>
neutral|Good work, stranger. The Thorn will nurture these eggs until their hatchlings are ready to bleed for us.
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
anger|Pain is just weakness leaving the body!
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
joy|Confident, I like that.
surprise|Found you!
neutral|So long, stranger.
joy|Thank you. Could you bring me their dog tags? Some of the troopers should still be wearing them.
disgust|Are you playing games with me, goddammit?
surprise|Aha!
anger|Damn!
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
joy|I didn't expect to see you here. What can I do for you?
neutral|Was the Courier male or female, and what kind of karma did the Courier have?
neutral|I... I don't know if I can stay. Maybe it'd be better for everyone if I left. Spent my life... somewhere else.
neutral|If you have nothing to teach, don't make the offer.
neutral|What can be said? He's a man of towering intellect, the founder of the Legion, conquerer of 86 tribes.
neutral|They are nice, aren't they? I'm very proud of them.
anger|Look out!
disgust|Slim pickings, but all right.
sadness|Did you hear President Kimball was killed? The guys here aren't taking it very well.
surprise|So far working with the NCR hasn't been too bad. If anything, things seem to be getting better.
neutral|Nobody here's any use to you in a fight against Deathclaws, but take these medical supplies. You'll probably need them.
anger|Thought no one was looking, did you?
neutral|I'd pit one of my men against two of your cutthroats any day. Backed by additional troops, we'll mop the floor with your pathetic Legion.
anger|That's against regulations!
joy|I hear the Great Khans are pretty tough, I hope we can join them.
neutral|While it initially appeared to be an NCR victory, we're receiving word that our own Mr. House may have been the one to secure the Dam for himself.
anger|What do you think? He started drawing tickets, and that's how people got punished.
anger|Even other Omertas would also want to kill him if they knew what he does. He's broken so many of their rules that I don't know how he still breathes.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|Just imagine the look on Baldie's face when those Securitrons come pouring out on judgment day! I'd pay to have that bronzed!
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
neutral|Now you're talking! I'll be impressed if you make it out alive, stranger.
neutral|Here's a compensation for your service. I trust that we're in agreement over it.
neutral|When he did, I went to his bedside and showed him the helmet I'd had forged to cover his face. I said he could have it if he'd fight for me.
neutral|Anything you can do to help, just please get us out of here.
surprise|Aha!
joy|I'll send word to Major Polatli about your work here. Thanks.
anger|The Legion's the only thing I want on my mind right now.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
anger|They killed her!
anger|No, I'll destroy it because it's inevitable that it be destroyed. It's Hegelian Dialectics, not personal animosity.
disgust|You are such an asshole sometimes.
surprise|Grenade!
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
surprise|Word is those tough guys rangers are here. I ain't seen them myself, but how scary can they be?
joy|I kinda like being a farmer.
neutral|VStoryEventBoomers set to 1.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
neutral|What's going on with the Boomers?
disgust|Murderer!
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
anger|This is an emergency. How can you be asking for payment?
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
sadness|I heard the Legion took out another one of our patrols. If this continues there won't be many of us left.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
surprise|Where'd she go?
disgust|Next thing I know, I wake up like... like this.  I've been staying in this house ever since.
anger|That's against regulations!
surprise|Me? I've been doing this shit for far too long and have been in too many battles to remember.
surprise|How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
surprise|That doesn't... why would he pull a stunt like that? Got anything else to offer?
anger|Fine, be like that. I'm just here to give you whatever information I can to help you get the job done.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
joy|NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
joy|The NCR eventually took them down quite a bit, but the really fascinating thing about them is the origin of their culture as a whole. You see....
surprise|Hey, you're the one that's been hunting the most dangerous beasts for The Thorn!
neutral|Intense fighting erupted on Hoover Dam as tensions between NCR and Caesar's Legion boiled over.
sadness|Still... this has got to be one of the worst situations I've been in. Not too much I can do about it but do my job and do it right.
anger|Don't talk to me!
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
joy|Besides. I was on break when it happened.
surprise|You trying to get me busted? Keep your damn voice down - Lieutenant Hayes already has his eye on me.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
anger|You'd better get out of here.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
fear|Sorry I don't have anything else to offer.
neutral|It's been a pleasure.
disgust|They're worried the filthy drunkies in detox seeing me drink will cause an immediate relapse. I say their rehab effort here is just a revolving door.
neutral|When he looked at you, you could see he understood. After some of the things we'd seen, that meant something.
anger|He should've fled with the caps he stole from the family. We Omertas don't forget and now's time to pay for your offenses.
surprise|Really? You got something to say about the big boss, huh? Well, why don't you say it to his face instead of yapping at me?
anger|How the hell did a brahmin get loose on the Strip? If this is another one of Private Erwin's pranks, I'll make him regret it.
sadness|Don't think I'll make it topside any time soon.
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
neutral|Have a seat. This will take awhile.
anger|Come back when you have news about the Boomers.
joy|I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
anger|What was that for?
anger|Come on!
disgust|Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
joy|They really care about your privacy here at the Tops. Even room service has an unlisted number!
disgust|Hold it right there, Courier. I been hearing things about you, and they ain't all been good.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
neutral|More classics coming right up for you. So stay tuned.
neutral|We need to stop and pee soon.
anger|What the hell?!
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
neutral|Nipton was a wicked place, debased and corrupt. It served all comers, so long as they paid.
anger|You don't give up, do you?
fear|Because it's a far safer place to be than here.
joy|Wish I could've seen you capture those beasts for our Thorn!
joy|Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
fear|Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
joy|Chip slippery! More slippery than the Chair thinks!
neutral|That you were searched very thoroughly when you arrived at the Fort is a certainty. And as the Chip is a little too large to be secreted away...
surprise|Horns fall on bloody rocks. Head voices saw many bodies.
joy|
disgust|Hey, you asked. Don't want the answer, don't ask a guy's opinion.
sadness|No time to talk. I have to keep watch for Legion raiding parties.
joy|I hope the Fiends have learned their lesson.
anger|Get your own!
fear|There's still more troopers out there!
surprise|Head voices say quiet man knows more than he says about horns!
neutral|Why else would he shut himself in like that?
surprise|In what way, boss?
anger|We'll get 'em.
fear|I, uh, got kicked out of the Atomic Wrangler for that one.
joy|After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
sadness|The Tops is a real snooze fest. I hope they get some new shows soon.
anger|North it is. Reports also say that they might have some NCR hostages. If that's true we need to do what we can to save them. So stay sharp.
joy|Ring-a-ding! My card.
anger|Back off! I know how to use this gun, and I'm not afraid to shoot if you try anything!
joy|Cool. Can I try?
sadness|Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
fear|If that's what it takes to win your trust, that's what it takes. Follow me.
anger|I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
anger|They killed him!
surprise|Scatter!
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
fear|I know boss, and I know it is going to be hard for you to trust me again. But are you going to take the word of this outsider over mine?
anger|I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
joy|You're always welcome around the Hope, Courier - least as far as I'm concerned.
fear|You're not going to cause any problems, right?
joy|My buddies at Camp McCarran are breathing easy now that the Fiends' leader is dead.
neutral|You are messenger and message both, it would seem.
neutral|No need to apologize.
joy|You don't get it yet, stranger. I'm not surprised, though. It takes a special type. Come back when you've got what it takes.
joy|I get those two ducks in a row, Vegas can defend itself versus all comers - NCR, Caesar's Legion, it won't matter.
anger|That's not a good idea.
neutral|Our way of life is based on them. We know no other path. There is no other path.
anger|You pushed me too far!
sadness|Here I run the finest entertainment venue in all New Vegas, and you're asking me "what else is there?"
surprise|Holy shit!
neutral|Very well. Will there be anything else?
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
neutral|The eggs I seek are not easy to find, stranger. Your best chances are in the mountains north of Goodsprings, and west from Quarry Junction.
fear|I'm getting out of here!
anger|They killed him!
anger|You better scram before I sic the entire Strip after you.
joy|That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
anger|Don't like no one drawing a bead on me.
neutral|They got what they had coming. Glad we were the ones to deliver it.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
neutral|Who wants to swim? Water's fiiiiine.
neutral|Town was Broken Hills. Bunch of Super Mutants, humans, and Ghouls all living together peacefully. Well, most of the time.
neutral|We've had people go rogue, though, and start helping people. One chapter had a small civil war over it. We take our isolationism seriously.
joy|Another satisfied customer.
disgust|Murderer!
sadness|I don't know. The NCR's stretched thin as it is. I've put in requests at Camp Golf, Forlorn Hope, McCarran - but things are no better there.
neutral|Heh. Good. That's the look I was going for. Trust me on this one, though. You'll be glad you brought me along.
surprise|Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
anger|That's not a good idea.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
joy|I'm not going to argue with you there. Thanks, I appreciate this.
anger|Don't listen to a word No-bark says. He spouts nothing but nonsense.
neutral|Sir, yes, Sir!
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
joy|Even Presidents die, huh? Good.
surprise|The next day twenty roll up. So we listened.
neutral|Or did, until the NCR showed them that ideological purity and shiny power armor don't count for much when you're outnumbered 15:1.
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
anger|Shit, not even down this rat-hole can I drink in peace? I don't need no friends. I just need you to get the fuck out of my sight.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
joy|Nellis has revealed many secrets. It has taught us how to fly the bombers once based here. And it has taught us where to find one!
surprise|You're wasting no time in making a name for yourself around here, huh?
joy|Come here, baby. I'm all yours... are you ready to be all mine?
sadness|I heard Quartermaster Mayes sent some guys out for supplies and they never came back. I wonder if they just ran off instead.
neutral|I like to think you have enough sense to do the right thing. The rewards for doing so are immense... as are the punishments for not doing so.
surprise|Holy shit!
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
neutral|Here you go. I promised you an extra reward for coming along, so that's what you get.
neutral|Alpha Squad reporting in. Thanks for the support back there. We've been assigned to ensure you make it to the Legate. How can we be of assistance?
neutral|Do whatever Caesar tells you to do. And whenever the opportunity presents, strike at the Profligates. Pile body upon body.
anger|You can jump out the window, for all I care, mister.
neutral|Okay.
neutral|Take a look at these beauties.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
neutral|You can ask, but why would I do that? Karl's told me all about life in the Legion! He says I've got all the makings of a speculatore.
surprise|Horns leave this place. Head voices see them go far away.
neutral|Veronica, tell me this isn't about-
neutral|Primm: Idolized.
surprise|Haha, not too bright, huh? It takes caps, honey, lots of them.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
sadness|It's this place - my inspiration ebbs and I don't know how to stop it! I can't feel the warmth anymore...
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
sadness|Terrible thing, what happened to the Hostetlers.
sadness|This is a poem I wrote about the dark loneliness that suffuses my soul.
joy|Ha ha ha! I wash ma bown. Wesibe.
surprise|Grenade!
neutral|It sure as hell is. Aside from being an important source of power and water, it's a symbol of hope.
joy|You were right, but here, take another helping for your friend. It'll be our secret.
neutral|The Thorn needs newborn specimens that will one day grow to honor us with their blood.
joy|That's great to hear, really great.
anger|Let me tell you something, that refugee camp? It's built on the blood and tears of my people. Nobody likes to talk about it, but I remember.
neutral|I know there's a concrete building there across from Mick and Ralph's. No ceiling, but I think it still counts.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
surprise|A face-to-face meeting with House, huh? The NCR would kill to be in your shoes.
neutral|Here's your NCR money. Will there be anything else?
neutral|Leading his people to a new land with big dreams and a clean slate. Makes me think of my old mentor.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|Ah, forget it. I'm gonna go get a drink.
neutral|Zone clear! Advance to the next position.
disgust|Try robbing me, will you?
fear|Cooke is just an overambitious prick, and he's going to get us all killed.
anger|You better be sleeping with one eye open.
sadness|All our work was for nothing.
neutral|Alice McLafferty runs the Crimson Caravan. You can find her over in the main office.
joy|Wow, if it isn't the woman who saved President Kimball. What can I do for you this fine day?
anger|Good enough. Hand it over.
surprise|Book girl has hard decision to make.
neutral|Primm formally swore in a new sheriff today. RNV reporters were on hand to hear the new sheriff address the crowd.
anger|No surrender!
joy|You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
joy|Let me know if you need anything else.
neutral|No, actually, you're born into it. My parents, their parents, so on. When you're young you can choose to leave. But it's home, so most people don't.
neutral|Out here, we don't have bosses. Me, the gunsmiths, and the guards all know what we're supposed to be doing.
sadness|The Tops is a real snooze fest. I hope they get some new shows soon.
anger|Why don't you just move on to another town?
joy|I want you to put down the troopers that... changed. Turned into ghouls.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
anger|Come out and face your death!
neutral|There's Novac, due west. Just look for the big lizard. They got some decent supplies and a place to stay.
surprise|Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
joy|I hope this unpleasantness will be over soon.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|Light armor and machetes only. The challenger - the one who asks to enter the arena - may be pitted against one or more opponents.
surprise|Great. Yeah, this is just what I needed.
joy|I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
anger|Flank 'em!
joy|You can't hide from me.
anger|If I can get this place in order, then I can focus our efforts on taking back Nelson from the Legion.
joy|NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
joy|NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
neutral|I will personally gut the first man to slow down!
joy|We owe you so much for saving our President.
joy|After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
neutral|All clear!
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
anger|Why are you even talking to me?
anger|If you want to get fucked up, Gomorrah's the place to go. Wish I was there now.
joy|That's how you make .44 ammo that'll put the fear of the heavens on any waster that dare cross your path.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
anger|Then you'll have to kill me. My vengeance will not be stayed.
neutral|We needed someone to be able to go into the cisterns and get the water out, but any of us would be suspicious. Hector volunteered.
neutral|Bighorners. Good eating. And we can trade the hides. Got a lot of wild ones around here, so it's easy to restock the herd.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|My men and I are soldiers. We share an obligation to follow orders. And our orders are to hold this dam.
disgust|You've been with the Family long enough to know how this goes. I'm sorry you had to fuck this up. Goodbye, you were a real benefit to the business.
sadness|I can't offer much more aside from some extra ammo.
sadness|Oh... very well then. What else can I do for you?
surprise|I didn't think anyone could kill an NCR Ranger in single combat.
sadness|Can't go anywhere else.
joy|More fights, we want more.
sadness|Are you still there?
anger|Fuck you. You'll get the same as everyone else.
neutral|You've got yourself a deal.
joy|Alright, I'll give you full access.
neutral|I don't mean disrespect. It's a hell of a thing having someone with your ability looking out for me.
joy|I bet NCR troops can't wait to clean the sewers.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
joy|WooooOOOOOOoooo.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
surprise|Yeah, well, you see anybody wearing Legion crimson or a lot of sports equipment, you just let me know.
sadness|I... look, we can't talk here. If you think you can help me, follow me to my room, please.
joy|I hope the Fiends stop their raids now that their boss is gone
anger|That's right, you should be going - because you have work to do.
surprise|No sir, I'm 28. Why?
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
surprise|Look at that. Maybe them bullets done your brain some good.
joy|Yeah, I could've ended buried in the sands with just my head sticking out. Ants love that - a riot, know what I mean?
surprise|Oh, what am I doing? I got to thinking about making a good impression and plain forgot to tell you my name.
neutral|This disk has secrets to breeding plants that can thrive in the wasteland.
neutral|Which companion?
fear|Uh-oh, I'll call the Securitrons if you try anything crazy with me, understand?
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
surprise|Hey!
anger|What was that for?
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
neutral|You're no friend to the Great Khans. You should turn around and leave - and if we see you in the Mojave, well... accidents happen.
anger|I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
joy|Nice try. Let's play another game.
neutral|Whatever.
neutral|I don't know. Some kind of man-fish freak like the one I killed over there.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
anger|That's against regulations!
joy|You're the one who busted those assholes at Gomorrah, huh? Good work!
joy|If it isn't the guy that defeated the Legion at Nelson. I can't thank you enough, morale around here has never been higher.
neutral|It all gets shipped by rail over towards Boulder City and Hoover Dam. The NCR's probably building fortifications with it all.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
neutral|Good idea. I'd like to keep my head intact.
disgust|All that wealth is wasted on the Strip. There are people in Freeside who need food and medicine.
anger|Tangle with the Gun Runners and it's the last thing you'll do.
neutral|There's a boy, too old to be trained as a Legionary. Normally they have to die, but he's too frail to make trouble.
anger|What do you want now?
fear|Just, don't do anything crazy.
surprise|I heard you've killed Deathclaws at The Thorn. I couldn't believe it!
anger|That the best you can do?
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
neutral|What's your reputation with Novac?
anger|Got no time or answers for you. Ask a drifter in need of a few caps, they'll give you all the answers you need.
neutral|No way! I seen what happens when you mess with these collars!
surprise|You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
joy|One of New Vegas' finest! You are always welcome in the Strip.
anger|That's impressive - if you're telling the truth.
anger|
joy|Confident, I like that.
joy|House all dead, we should hit the Strip. Rip shit up.
surprise|I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
sadness|I don't know what to say. Words don't begin. The least I can do is comp you the Presidential for as long as you want it.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
disgust|Right. Got it. I'll just stop using this melee weapon and instead use a melee weapon. Good idea, boss.
fear|Uh-oh, I'll call the Securitrons if you try anything crazy with me, understand?
sadness|No apologies needed, friend - I'm sure there's somebody out there'll appreciate my singing.
joy|Hey, you've been a big help. I wanted to give you something for helping me out. It's not much, but here you go.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|Righty-o, daddy-o. Let's do it!
sadness|Yeah?
anger|We got company, boss!
surprise|Aha!
fear|Leave me alone!
neutral|Don't have the patience for this drunk escort shit tonight...
neutral|He wants to out-fight the Legion in a straight-forward slugging match, and then, when they rout, pursue and destroy them in detail.
fear|What!? No, please! Here, take the caps but please don't hurt me!
neutral|Our intelligence has discovered that high ranking members of the Omertas have been having clandestine meetings for the past several months.
anger|How the hell did the monorail blow up? Someone's bringing back luck into the Strip, I tell you.
neutral|Caps it is. Will there be anything else?
fear|Nope, no way. I'm not going anywhere until I know they're gone.
neutral|More coming!
neutral|These Legion boys are coo-coo, you realize?
anger|I'll get out of your hair, then.
anger|How'd you get in here without getting shot?
anger|No!
surprise|Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|Only engineers and authorized personnel are allowed upstairs. Please step away.
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
neutral|However, the pipes below have been sealed, cutting off our men until the dam top can be secured.
joy|I've been in love with the same woman for 17 years. If my wife ever finds out, she'll kill me!
disgust|Still helping the Legion. You're gonna get what's coming to you. I promise you that.
surprise|What was that?
joy|Cool. Can I try?
neutral|He was brought into the Legion as a boy, survived training, fought well enough as Legionary to be promoted to the rank of Decanus.
sadness|Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
disgust|Yeah, thought so.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
neutral|I oversaw the city's renovations starting from 2274 onward. The Three Families are my employees.
disgust|Damn shame. Anything else I can do for you?
neutral|It's one of just two places on Earth that have the hardware necessary to read the Platinum Chip  - the Lucky 38 is the other, of course.
neutral|I've reconsidered my position, and I think it would be in my best interest if I were to sacrifice my profit on this particular deal.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
anger|I warned you about the price of disobedience. I guess you weren't listening.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
surprise|Sounds like the NCR and the Legion are both gearing up for a fight. Been seeing a lot more soldiers around.
anger|What makes you think I give a damn about you?
surprise|Grenade!
joy|This place smells like booze and sex. That's why I always come back.
neutral|All right, enough fun for tonight.
neutral|Rumors have surfaced that Tops Hotel owner Benny has taken yet another unexpected leave of absence. We spoke to his right-hand man, Swank.
anger|This is our turf. Don't even try to snoop around or I'll fucking kill your right here, right now.
joy|What are you doing?
anger|Did you not realize that I have eyes in the back of my head?
anger|What the hell?!
joy|You got it.
joy|Okay, I got clothes I can use for that. When you give the word, I'll let the other girls know and we'll meet you at the lobby.
anger|I've got nothing to say to you, punk. Scram!
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
joy|Man, I love my guns.
anger|Oh, that's it. Your ass is mine!
joy|I can give you stims or radiation supplies, which would you prefer?
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
neutral|I hope you change your mind.
surprise|Aha!
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
disgust|Easy - this is where they send all the fuck-ups and people they don't want. But hey, it's not like I'm bitter or anything.
anger|What do you need?
surprise|Bull attacks bears! Many more will come.
joy|With the help you've given us, we're doing a little bit better, but we still have the Legion forces at Nelson to deal with.
neutral|Maybe the best place to start is to see what we can find out directly from the NCR. Let's head to their OSI office at McCarran.
neutral|The elder who brought us to the Mojave, Father Elijah, usually had me looking for these old memory units. But he'd never tell me what they were for.
neutral|Are we done, then?
joy|We've been reinforced fairly well, thanks to your help. I'd say the odds are in our favor.
neutral|Yes, I suppose you're right. Please, take this: it's half of our savings. We'll manage, somehow, as we've always done.
anger|Oh, I'll give you the Platinum Chip. And then you'll use it exactly like I tell you to.
neutral|And if it should turn out we need their land later, well, it's not like we don't have the force to drive them out again.
joy|Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
fear|Aaaah!
anger|All right, well, might want to get a move on, is all I'm saying.
surprise|What on earth is *that* creature?
surprise|Thanks. Anything else?
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
surprise|Grenade!
anger|That's mine!
anger|You're dead!
fear|If the NCR beats the Legion at Hoover Dam, they'll turn on us and claim the Strip. And we don't have the muscle to beat them - not yet.
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
anger|I saw you take that!
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
anger|Stay away from me.
fear|Please, no more!
surprise|What was that?
neutral|Take it.
neutral|Ha ha, Mars favors the bold, does he not?
sadness|Ah, the other dudes call him Jerry the Punk. That's kind of harsh, though - I think he's just a sensitive soul that needs some love.
anger|Come on!
joy|Another satisfied customer.
neutral|What about them?
anger|We'll get 'em.
surprise|What in the goddamn...?
neutral|That could be the only one of its kind.
neutral|Not looking to fight. That'll give NCR an excuse to come up here and wipe us out.
neutral|If you're looking for humans, the Khans are north of us and an NCR base at McCarran, past Vault 3. Supposedly there are muties to the southeast.
fear|Bear heads in pain. But voices don't know who hurt them.
neutral|Go ahead and destroy one. The explosion will be large enough to be heard and felt aboveground.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
sadness|I'm gonna miss having Anderson around.
fear|So long as the Khans keep making it, I keep getting high.
joy|Just swing back by as you recruit folks, I'll get you your bread.
joy|They are? Oh my God, thank you! Thank you so much!
disgust|Better not try that again.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
disgust|Didn't expect Caesar to send a woman to do this job.
joy|Hey, I'm just happy to get any kind of work I can.
surprise|How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|Primm: Wild Child.
neutral|You know, sometimes the journey beats the destination. Especially if your spurs go Jingle Jangle Jingle, and you meet some nice gals on the way.
anger|Say goodbye to the hostage, fucker.
disgust|That's... an unfortunate mistake.
neutral|Wanted somewhere with concrete walls. Something about airwaves. I forget.
joy|A Ranger, here in the Strip? Fine company, sir!
joy|You're the boss.
joy|I'm not surprised Kimball survived. We NCR people are made of hard stuff.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
surprise|Damn, be careful with those things!
anger|What have you done?
disgust|That patrol was wiped out by its own incompetence - a couple of the troopers were fooling around with a grenade when it went off.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
joy|Where's my manners? Here's some cash up front. There'll be more where that came from.
surprise|Arms of mars are unbound. Watch them swing!
neutral|Have half a mind to throw you all in a cell and let you sweat it off.
neutral|Giant Radscorpions against two Deathclaws.
joy|I'll just have to keep looking. Thanks anyway.
surprise|Where'd she go?
disgust|Better not try that again.
surprise|Broken one is ended. Head voice not sure what this mean.
disgust|Shit, honey, it was this or the Fiends, and Fiends don't last too long in the NCR.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
anger|Like I said before, we don't. And I'm not inclined to discuss why.
neutral|Intriguing. Janet puts in a good word for me, and the Crimson Caravan gains exclusive access to the Boomers. Yes, that works for me.
surprise|Hey!
joy|Here's a start on your retainer. And as a signing bonus, take the key to the Presidential - best suite in the house!
anger|I sent Calhoun, the Follower captured with me, back West with a message that I should not be interfered with.
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
neutral|If not, then I want to make sure that the Boomers don't sign similar treaties to fire their guns in support of the NCR or Caesar's Legion.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
anger|That's not a good idea.
surprise|I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
sadness|I really don't like to talk about it. Let's just say it was a tragedy and the NCR is to blame, and we'll leave it at that.
joy|Hold still please. It's harder to hit you if you keep running around like that.
surprise|What are you, crazy? These Praetorians mean business!
anger|Look out!
anger|Are you drunk?
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
sadness|That's right. Folks just don't talk to other folks, and everybody's always cross with each other.
anger|I have a present for you from the Powder Gangers... I hope you like dynamite!
surprise|What the-?
disgust|Murderer!
joy|Anything branded by the NCR related to weapons, computers, or radios.
neutral|My apologies, but that name and face ain't ringing the old school bell upstairs. Afraid I can't let you through until the "situation" is resolved.
sadness|Better move along, there's not much for you here.
neutral|<snuffle!>
sadness|Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for the missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured troopers.
neutral|He went over to Westside to talk to Tom Anderson. Anderson's a Follower of the Apocalypse. Helps the people in Westside grow crops or something.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
neutral|Sure.
neutral|Very well. Will there be anything else?
neutral|It's a weak bunch, to be honest. I'd rather have extra currency to buy supplies or better captures off traders.
neutral|There are caches of Stealth Boys out there. With the Mark II in hand, it shouldn't be difficult to upgrade every one of them.
anger|You better be sleeping with one eye open.
neutral|Maybe, maybe not. I always warned him not to push my buttons. Well, ain't nobody going to miss him, anyways.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
neutral|Okay. What better way to persuade them than to give them a taste of what they stand to gain, right?
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
joy|Thanks for helping us keep the Strip safe.
anger|It's my fucking job, and no one sees the bosses unless I give the okay.
sadness|Yeah, I know. That's why I'm not really going to do it.
neutral|Not too common but you still see 'em around.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
surprise|You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
neutral|VStoryEventRemnants set to 1.
joy|You're a model citizen, thank you.
anger|What was that for?
anger|Don't make me take that away.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
anger|Why you lousy no-good punk! Give me one reason why I shouldn't take this to Benny right now!
neutral|What are your thoughts?
neutral|I don't know who screwed up, but the Powder Gangers are loose. It was one group that attacked us and took our entire supply of dynamite.
anger|I don't see what this helps. She's dead.
neutral|Followers: Accepted.
anger|They killed him!
surprise|This was new for the tribes, you see. They played at war, raiding each other, a little rape and pillage here, a little ransoming there.
anger|Hey, scram. Come bug me when I'm at the diner... if you're a real pain in the ass.
neutral|Well, things aren't great here, but I've seen a lot worse. We've got the Fiends to the south of us, and that ain't good.
neutral|If you should make it down there, unsealing the pipes again will allow us to spill over the enemy like a tide of blood.
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
anger|Try not to smile so wide, baby. You might break your mouth.
anger|We Followers aren't pushovers!
anger|Our warriors will wash over them in a tide of blood, severing arms before they can attack, legs before they can run, and heads before they can pray.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
disgust|Okay, I'll be here if you come to your senses.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
sadness|Maybe when this is all over, they'll find time to look after us.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
anger|I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
neutral|It was on the front line for a while. Only resort in New Vegas no one wanted to get sent to.
joy|You're welcome. Enjoy.
neutral|He tried to hide it, but I could tell right away. He was glad.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|Maybe, but the situation around here calls for it. You gonna help or not?
neutral|No way. If the guard catches you, we'll be beaten.
neutral|I figured us mutants needed a place to call our own. Town's far enough away from humans so they don't bother us much.
joy|If it isn't the gal that defeated the Legion at Nelson. I can't thank you enough, morale around here has never been higher.
surprise|Hey!
sadness|The last person I saw him talking to was Lieutenant Romanowski. Romanowski's around here somewhere. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
joy|After the help you gave us with the shooting range, we'll take any advice you've got. I'll line them up.
sadness|Ain't my mind needs changing, kid, it's Garret's.
neutral|Most merchant companies - successful merchant companies, rather - have them. It can be inconvenient to replace employees on short notice.
anger|I need someone to talk to a few of the officers and help them resolve some of the problems around here.
anger|At this point, I'll take anything you can give me. We need more troops, fresh supplies, and medical relief.
fear|I'm not a threat to anyone!
neutral|Alright, what's on your mind?
joy|What, now? This better be good.
neutral|Given the conditions here, it's not hard to see why. I'll change all that, soon enough.
neutral|We went separate ways after that. I went east into the Rockies, looking for other mutants like myself.
anger|What about it?
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
neutral|Don't give up. They're out there, somewhere, and we're not safe until they've been destroyed.
anger|I bet I'd get a reward for bringing your head to the authorities, assassin!
neutral|Hey New Vegas, have you ever said you loved someone when it wasn't quite true? Sure you have. But you shouldn't. Because It's a Sin to Tell a Lie.
anger|Good way to lose a hand.
anger|You'll pay for what you did to our soldiers at Forlorn Hope, murderer!
surprise|No. No you're not, are you? Maybe you shouldn't go. Not just yet.
disgust|It's amazing what passes for a firearm around here. You'd be better off throwing rocks.
neutral|What happened to President Kimball?
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
fear|You're not going to cause any problems, right?
anger|I don't work for freelancers. So move along.
neutral|You're no friend to the Great Khans. You should turn around and leave - and if we see you in the Mojave, well... accidents happen.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
neutral|Hence, Caesar wants you to destroy whatever you find in this bunker.
sadness|I'm glad it's taken care of, but still, I wish it could have been resolved without violence. There's too much bad blood there already.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|Are you crazy? They'd run us down in an instant!
disgust|Haven't seen him. Serves him right if the NCR declares him AWOL.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
disgust|I see jack and shit - 'cept no jack.
sadness|Cool. Maybe later.
anger|Yeah, well, laugh it up on your own time.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
surprise|Whoa!
fear|Yo, little help here!
surprise|I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
joy|Another satisfied customer.
neutral|Here.
neutral|Anyway... I don't know why we're here. Thought maybe it'd help me see things better.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
anger|She's making a move! Stop her!
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
anger|No!
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
anger|What was that for?
disgust|Huh? Wait, what are you talking about? We're allied with Caesar now? Psh. Typical. Nobody tells me anything.
neutral|Consequently, I have to "wait and see" what happens. It's... grotesque.
sadness|The surface world is a cruel place.
neutral|Good luck. I'm going to find a place to not get shot.
neutral|Once you get there ask for Ranger Grant. I've used roaming Securitrons to feed him useful information in the past.
joy|I made it so that cat can't help but be helpful, dig?
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
neutral|Vale.
disgust|It's amazing what passes for a firearm around here. You'd be better off throwing rocks.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
anger|No!
neutral|Now, I'm not claiming that Nightstalkers are running around wearing Stealth Boys, mind you. I just don't think it's all a coincidence.
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
neutral|Boomers: Wild Child.
disgust|Take the bear. I can't believe I let some of my best dogs get killed over this stupid thing.
anger|But, the brass at McCarran doesn't want us to waste resources on something they consider a minor target. So we just get to watch.
neutral|That's it, keep moving.
neutral|I think it is safe to move up.
sadness|I heard Chief Hanlon committed suicide. That's just... hard to believe. Do you know anything about it?
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
fear|Get away! I'm not part of your fight!
neutral|All right then... just sign here, here, and... here.
neutral|Yeah. He introduced himself to me once. I shook his hand. Doubt he'd remember me now, though.
joy|Fuck that Caesar dog! I'm going to drink in your name, all night!
joy|I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
neutral|Didn't know him. He's a signature on my discharge papers.
fear|Guess it ain't no secret how you, uh... I say, can you ask them to put their weapons down. Was just reaching in my coat to give you a cigar.
fear|Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
surprise|Fiends don't come here no more, they say.
surprise|Crowned heads make nice with bears? Voices confused.
surprise|Huh. We made it through after all. Not sure what to make of that.
neutral|He's set up his camp in the office area at the south end of this power plant.
anger|Look out!
sadness|I just had my rifle with me. Just me, against all of them, so... I took the shot.
sadness|Maybe when this is all over, they'll find time to look after us.
anger|If we can retake Nelson, that will be a huge help to our efforts in this area and give us an advantage at Hoover Dam.
anger|We're just muscle. Alexander's the man to talk to.
neutral|How many?
neutral|Not really. Heard it's paradise in the wasteland. Never been in there myself, doubt they'd let a mutant in.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
joy|Thanks.
disgust|A tribe of finks. Every single one of them is a degenerate.
joy|I'm glad to see you.
joy|People say it's hard to survive the Wasteland - how hard can it be, the water glows in the dark!
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
anger|Why are you even talking to me?
neutral|Those are the risks of a hunter's life. I've delivered as promised, but perhaps I should better search for someone with greater resolve and honor?
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
fear|What do you want with me?
fear|Green grass man dead. Head voices wonder why?
neutral|Thanks, I appreciate it. Come back here when you're done, I might accidentally "lose" some supplies to pay you with.
anger|Who the hell are you, coming in here and asking me if I can "spare any?" I don't hand out NCR troopers to anybody who wanders out of the Wasteland!
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
neutral|But they don't know a fraction of what we know. If we took on their role, we could stand up to anyone. We wouldn't have to hide.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
disgust|I'm sure that was a cleverly-planned act, boss, and not just random psychosis.
anger|That's not a good idea.
sadness|I don't know what else to do to help them...
joy|Welcome to the 188 Slop & Shop. Like our slogan says, "It's better than nothing."
anger|What have you done?
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
neutral|You're no friend to the Great Khans. You should turn around and leave - and if we see you in the Mojave, well... accidents happen.
fear|Oh no!
neutral|This holotape contains the updated security codes for the Ranger Stations. Show it to the comm officers there.
surprise|Dialectics tells us that this can't last. There has to be a synthesis, a final sorting out.
anger|We'll get 'em.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
neutral|They'd be marginally more effective. We lost most of the chapter defending glorified artillery.
surprise|Fiends don't come here no more, they say.
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
surprise|Hey!
disgust|Got a habit of repeating yourself.
anger|You will be avenged, Brother.
fear|Samuel Cooke. It was his idea to organize a jailbreak, but now he's just an overambitious prick who's going to get us all killed.
joy|Thank you for getting me here. Jack is a great guy.
neutral|Here's a compensation for your service. I trust that we're in agreement over it.
joy|You've been a huge help here. Thanks to you, I think we can hold this camp together.
neutral|Security is going to be tight. Rangers are stationed all around the observation deck where Kimball is going to give his speech.
disgust|Kindly remove yourself, as I have no desire to be struck by a stray round when disgruntled troopers begin firing on you.
surprise|Whoa!
neutral|You've, indeed, become the greatest hunter The Thorn has ever seen, the best I've ever seen.
joy|Nice work at the Tops buddy.
neutral|You're welcome.
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
anger|Don't make any trouble for us, we won't make any trouble for you.
surprise|Grenade!
anger|I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
anger|What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
joy|In the meantime, enjoy the high life. Room service is on me. I'll send up a bottle of the good stuff. Ta-ta.
neutral|Thank you. I think I just needed to hear someone else say it. I suppose without rule of law, we're no better than raiders.
disgust|Consider yourself lucky.
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
surprise|Wait. You just got into town. Maybe you shouldn't go. Not just yet.
neutral|Maybe you don't want for food much, but you can sell these on the market for a good price. Like I said, we're much obliged for the help.
surprise|Glad that fucker House is gone.
neutral|No such privilege for the women, though. Figures. So... to answer your question... they're a bunch of hypocritical jerkwads. It's a word.
disgust|I cannot wait to find you so I can kill you as a personal favor to Uncle Sam.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
neutral|Please remove yourselves from the fountain.
surprise|Aha!
neutral|If you're good at snooping around, then I could use you. I need to find out what my daughter's up to.
surprise|Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
neutral|What part of the Strip?
neutral|You think I'm going to be easy, huh? Come get some, asshole!
anger|You dirty coward!
anger|Light 'em up!
surprise|Whoa!
neutral|You're pathetic. Hide behind words all you like, but your cowardice shows through.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
anger|What was that for?
disgust|I trust you're satisfied with the squad's newfound teamwork? It's almost entirely my own doing, I assure you.
surprise|Killing Fire Geckos at The Thorn is no joke, you're quite the fighter!
anger|So why don't you just leave me alone.
neutral|Although I hear the soldiers mount each other as much as they mount their women, so maybe they did keep a little something from the Empire.
anger|Damn!
neutral|Very few. Time is wasting. Hurry back so we can begin.
joy|Mostly drill the troops, try to keep the discipline up and combat readiness high.
joy|You saved the NCR's head honcho, sure you can save a bunch of low-life scum like us.
neutral|Really? Cool! Bring it back to me when you're done, okay? I think Stacey might be turning into an alien.
anger|That's not funny.
neutral|I know, I know. But I had to know how you'd react when I told you. We've made a lot of enemies.
joy|Another glorious day in this man's army!
neutral|Stay safe. The road's dangerous in these parts. Or so I hear.
neutral|Look, this affects all of us, even Hector. What were we supposed to do, let all of our gardens die? Watch Westside fall apart?
neutral|Here, this is edible.
sadness|Maybe it's time for me to leave this place, then. Any ideas where I can go?
joy|Hello, cutie.
anger|What are you doing here? Get out before I blow your head off!
disgust|For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
disgust|Better not try that again.
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
sadness|I wish you hadn't done that.
surprise|This is definitely part of my missing supplies. I'll talk to Major Polatli about this right away.
anger|Come for me then. Flails of God!
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
surprise|Head voice, that you?
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
neutral|General Oliver's strategy - or "tunnel vision," as I like to call it - has been to mass troops at Hoover Dam.
neutral|I'll send a Securitron ahead to meet with the NCR at the security checkpoint and get things started.
disgust|I just got word that 1st Recon is being mobilized to Nelson. God forbid we get any reinforcements here, right?
anger|I should make you pay for your crimes!
disgust|Come back when you actually have the money, you damn junkie.
fear|Brought too many bullets and not enough stimpaks!
joy|Thanks a lot, doc. Looks like I should be able to at least walk out of here, now.
anger|What was that for?
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
joy|Great. Get to it. Oh, and take this - there's some weird shit with this Vault's security and some doors will only open if you have a keycard.
joy|Taking down a Giant Radscorpion, by yourself, has made you popular down here.
fear|Get back!
anger|The bombs wiped the slate clean. Human civilization descended to a level of ignorance that effectively set our cultural progress back to zero.
anger|Grrrraah!
neutral|A good deal should be obvious to you by now. I won't spoil the rest by talking out of turn.
neutral|After you cut off access to the sulfur, Cooke left. I guess we're free to surrender to the NCR now.
disgust|Keeps his sunglasses on all the time, even when he's sleeping. Idiot.
surprise|Whoa!
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
surprise|What in the goddamn...?
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
anger|Oh did you now? What business is that of yours, and why the fuck should I care?
neutral|Our creatures come from the farthest reaches of the Wasteland. The Thorn takes care of them until the time to spill their blood comes.
anger|Back round? Just my luck... what'll it be this time?
joy|Leather suits are good times! Thinking about that just blows my top!
surprise|Aha!
joy|Did you hear? Gomorrah's under new management!
joy|Please, tell me! Is she all right? When did you see her? What does she have to say?
joy|Whoa, didn't you save President Kimball? Glad to have someone like you here!
joy|I hope the Fiends have learned their lesson.
anger|But maybe you're a little too... "reputable" to get involved in some dirty work for the Republic.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
anger|Even if you are Legion, you are not my Centurion! I do not "carry on" at your command.
neutral|Uhh, hey. Welcome to Red Rock Canyon. You've seemed a little bipolar lately - maybe you're having withdrawal symptoms?
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
neutral|Going to have words with your commanding officer after this.
neutral|Okay.
joy|NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
surprise|Isn't that Cass? I heard she'd gotten out of the caravan business.
neutral|Baby, if ever there was a need for violence, you is it. Just do me a favor and stay dead this time, hey? Ta-ta.
joy|Without leadership, the Fiends are as good as dead!
joy|I showed them total warfare. Like I said, there's a lot you can learn from old books.
neutral|Okay.
anger|Damnit! I can't believe the Legion actually got someone past our security. Good job catching him.
neutral|We constantly replenish our stock to keep this holy ground soaked red. Only a few brave ones ever earn the honor of servicing The Thorn.
disgust|Sure, maybe not if you're some hulking reprobate like Regis or baked to the gills like Jack. I've tried five times and still haven't made it.
neutral|It's an honor to have my wares used by such a wild badass. Cut's on the house, friend.
anger|We're heading back home. I hope our troops do the same. This land can't be saved.
sadness|If you see Alice again, please, tell her we won't hold it against her. Tell Alice that we love her.
disgust|Better not try that again.
anger|If you think it's worthwhile to make smart people learn how to talk like backward savages, you're a Follower of the Apocalypse... or an idiot.
joy|NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
surprise|The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
anger|Grrrraah!
anger|They killed her!
joy|Okay. Hold still. I don't want to make this any more painful than it already is.
joy|You have my thanks, we owe you a lot.
anger|Join the Great Khans, what the hell is Cooke thinking?
disgust|I'm starting to get angry. You would not like me when I'm angry.
neutral|It was such an incredible thing he did, putting his life on the line like that for my husband. It's not something most people would do.
neutral|My men await in the tunnel below. I am to divide them between the dam top and the tunnels that lead to the western power plant.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
neutral|The Khans and the NCR don't get along - they prefer to shoot us on sight, even if we're not looking for a fight.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
anger|Come back when you've destroyed whatever you find down in that bunker.
neutral|Let's hit the road, huh?
anger|Damn!
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
neutral|VStoryEventSecuritronsUpgraded set to 1.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
disgust|Back to the usual daily tedium.
joy|What can I do for you?
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
anger|If he ain't chiseling behind your back, he just sends his men, ready for a fight. Then you either "sell" your ranch for a penny or you're dead.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
disgust|Well, that sure is a dead body there, boss.
anger|What was that for?
anger|Look if you really want to help either get the fuck out of our way or hack that damn computer over there.
neutral|Everything I can. Farmers out here don't have the luxury of being picky. I get by mostly on maize and tobacco.
neutral|I had him tended to. He was maimed, most of face torn off. It was days before he regained consciousness.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|Sir, yes, Sir!
disgust|Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
neutral|I'm getting ready to run a caravan up towards Utah. There's a town called New Canaan which is supposed to be pretty prosperous.
neutral|Very well. Will there be anything else?
surprise|Huh? Where'd you go?
neutral|So I'm supposed to just start giving in to the demands of random strangers that come in here, huh? I don't think so.
neutral|I offer many benefits, but vacation time isn't one of them.
fear|Word is they're sending some of us home since we're not making the quota.
neutral|Huh. Well, in that case I take it back. You look pretty good, given the circumstances.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
anger|Yeah, I imagine that it takes a lot to fill the void of such a bottomless soul. Take the caps and leave me to my sorrows.
joy|A Follower is always welcome among our people.
neutral|And... you think that's worth her happiness? Go on and tell her, then. Watch what happens when you crush her dreams.
fear|Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
surprise|Oh my, aren't you something else...!? I guess you'll have to see for yourself what I can do, huh?
anger|Don't care about Kimball, until he starts to care about us.
surprise|No, I didn't. You might hear that kind of nonsense from a drunk trooper on the Strip, but not from me. The Legion doesn't have Super Mutants.
fear|Name's Regis. I'm Papa's second-in-command. You might say I... share your concern about Caesar.
anger|You're lucky we Followers tend to be forgiving.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
disgust|About three years ago, NCR's 1st Recon launched an attack on the Khan encampment here.
neutral|The news has been brought to you by the Vikki and Vance Casino. Vikki and Vance. Be our partner in crime.
joy|Hi there, miss.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
sadness|Sure, Caesar's a drag, but as long as we got each other, we don't care who the top dogs roll with.
fear|I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
anger|You better have a damn good reason for being in my medical center.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
neutral|I know, but now that I can see the way out, I'm not so sure. I'd rather not join my dead buddies anytime soon.
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
anger|I'm waiting to hear why this deserves our attention.
neutral|Lot of people complain about it, but they forget what it was like before we showed up.
anger|Don't mind if I do. Enjoy your reign as Queen Scumbag the First, Overlord of Westside.
neutral|Are you... going to spank us? I *so* love handcuffs!
neutral|If there really is a problem, they can take it up with Lieutenant Boyd at McCarran. Farming isn't my department.
neutral|VStoryEventBennySeen set to 3.
neutral|Plus I was up at Camp Golf when Bitter Springs went down. I faked like I was sick to get out of going, because I knew some of the people there.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
neutral|Folks call this East Vegas, but I don't care much for names.
neutral|It won't be easy, but I'll try going sober. Maybe then my family will want me back.
anger|Would you keep it down?
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
surprise|Ah, an educated fellow? Now that is almost as rare as artistry! So, how can you help me regain my inspiration?
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
disgust|So go to the building and take this fucking Platinum Chip with you. My Legionaries will meet you there, with your weapons and equipment.
anger|We Followers aren't pushovers!
joy|Hahaha! Yeeeehaw! Now, that's something I thought I'd never hear.
anger|We'll get 'em.
surprise|You know Julie? Not everyone in the NCR sees eye-to-eye with the Followers, but they're okay in my book, mostly because of her.
surprise|Ooh, a sharp customer! All right, all right, 5% it is.
joy|I'm always a sucker for a pretty face. What can I do for you, my fine dear?
neutral|No.
surprise|The Khans used to be a big deal around here, but look at them now. There's talk that they were all killed up in the mountains.
disgust|Murderer!
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
surprise|Whoa!
neutral|Okay.
surprise|Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
neutral|I know she's been frequenting the square in North Vegas, probably hanging out with street scum. I want to know more about her new "friends."
sadness|The Tops is a real snooze fest. I hope they get some new shows soon.
neutral|So you're the one Mr. House sent. His Securitron here informed me of what's going on.
joy|Really? I can't thank you enough. I'll wait here and watch the road. Good luck in there.
disgust|Better not try that again.
sadness|Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
neutral|Deathclaws are our most precious and our most feared contenders. I want you to be the one to deliver the sacred eggs to me, personally.
disgust|Doesn't mean he isn't suffering, or that he won't go feral eventually.
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
joy|The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
neutral|If I know my pal Benny, he's swinging with the Big Cat Upstairs as we speak. Or he's chasing some angel broad with cans as big as her halo! <Laughs>
joy|More like two, after what you did to the Omertas.
disgust|Those rockets over at REPCONN were the NCR's doing. Trying to keep us scared so they can stick around to "protect" us.
anger|But since we don't have anything solid we'll just have to keep our eyes out for anything out of the ordinary.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
neutral|All right. Sit still and let me work.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
surprise|Grenade!
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
neutral|Suit yourself. You can always change your mind.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
neutral|If we could just get rid of those damn snipers, or release our waiting men in the intake tower, we'd have the manpower to storm their positions.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
neutral|If fact, you ought to be on the Strip cleaning out the casinos.
sadness|I heard Private Stone turned himself in for stealing medical supplies. We're all stressed out here, but stealing medical supplies is low.
neutral|You've got yourself a deal.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
joy|In a hurry, are you? Very well then: The Great Khans came east out of the NCR 14 years ago. We ruled the Wastes, then, and called no man master.
surprise|Maybe you can help me, see, I can never tell when it's lunchtime.
joy|This place smells like booze and sex. That's why I always come back.
neutral|The leader of the Kings, who would only identify himself as "The King" voiced his displeasure, calling NCR citizens, quote, the devil in disguise.
anger|All right. I'll let it go - this time.
anger|Had enough?
surprise|Hey!
anger|I may be angry, but I'm not stupid.
neutral|But there's a handful of us and tens or hundreds of thousands of them. So it's not going to end well.
joy|Well, apart from serving as talent manager, show scheduler, and all-around man in charge of this fine theater, I happen to be its headline act.
joy|You're a model citizen, thank you.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
anger|Look out!
anger|Our main targets are the Legion leaders at Nelson. I've uploaded their last known locations to your Pip-Boy.
neutral|Shoot.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
joy|In fact I have a new idea I'm confident will help morale. But if I told the troopers, it would likely fall on deaf ears.
fear|We gotta problem, boys!
anger|Cut it out, will you?
neutral|I'd love to help you, but it seems I can't even prevent my own friends from getting killed. I'm sorry as can be, but I can't help you.
joy|Excellent, just let me grab my scalpel, and a body bag and we'll get started.
neutral|Those last five shots were a bad idea...
surprise|Aha!
neutral|Ok.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
fear|Just, don't do anything crazy.
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
surprise|Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|Sorry, no can do.
fear|I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
joy|Anything else I can do for you?
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
neutral|The Strip: Idolized.
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
neutral|I think that you should be able to divert the flow of the water into the generator turbines. That would grind them up like hamburger.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
anger|What the hell?!
neutral|Since the majority of my men are on assignment dealing with the Legion, I need someone to handle other matters that have arisen.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
sadness|Alright fine. Is there anything you do care about?
anger|Of course I am! That is to say, Caesar has many fine warriors, and I wouldn't wish to compare them to the Great Khans.
joy|We need more people like you in the NCR.
anger|You're lucky you haven't been shot walking in here after that assassination attempt.
joy|Groovy. Here's your stuff back - in case you run into company, you dig? I'll tell the boys to give you a pass to pack some heat.
surprise|Be careful, sweetie!
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
neutral|Are you ready?
neutral|If you find my friends, please return their dogtags to the NCR. People need to know what happened here.
anger|
anger|Damn!
fear|I can't see 'em!
anger|Yeah, right. You're sniffing up the wrong skirt. Try me again when you're tall, blonde, and female.
anger|I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
anger|Caesar's death was tragic, but do not think that it will break the Legion's resolve.
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
anger|High Elder Maxson didn't found us to be botanists, Veronica.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
surprise|I suppose if asked, I would. But that's a moot point, because Papa's in charge now, and he's not going anywhere.
neutral|Captures lose any claim to the names they called themselves when they let themselves be taken.
anger|Come on!
anger|That's not a good idea.
surprise|I've never seen a robot like that before.
anger|What have you done?
surprise|Sure, just make them quick.
neutral|We'll have to wait a few days for gunpowder, but this might just work out.  Tell Contreras the extra guns and ammo will be in the next shipment.
anger|Not a chance. Only the necessary personnel have authorization.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
anger|Quit screwing around!
neutral|Fine. Take it. But what the hell am I supposed to do now?
joy|You should've heard the cheers over the radio when news of the victory came back from the Dam.
disgust|Jesus, you really can't take a hint, can you?
anger|Come on!
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
joy|We're finally getting all the water we're supposed to. It's about time.
neutral|This whole war's about power, man. Caesar wants it. NCR wants it. Fantastic's got it.
neutral|There's word from Camp McCarran that an attempt to bomb its monorail system was foiled by an alert civilian contractor. Security is being tightened.
joy|What are you doing?
neutral|Yeah, he - or she, I guess - wandered into camp a couple of months back. Seemed friendly enough.
joy|That Legion boss would've never taken the city, but I'm glad he's a goner.
joy|Nice work at the Tops, buddy.
joy|That much, huh? You're right, we could use a tribute to our... I mean, our family's coffers.
disgust|How disgusting. You can see that strange mechanical mongrel's brain.
anger|Come on!
anger|You dirty coward!
disgust|Murderer!
joy|He's giving me a medal. I don't know why though. I'm just doing my job like all the other guys. I'm still excited though.
anger|Even without our President, we won't leave the new territories!
neutral|Nowheresville, that's where. Sorry about the double-cross - or are we up to quadruple? - but if someone's gonna die, it's you.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
neutral|Also...
neutral|Is there anything else I can help you with?
fear|Ah. I should have expected as much. There's still a lot of bad blood between the Khans and the NCR, ever since the incident here.
neutral|You'll be glad you did this. I'm gonna put a hole through Caesar's head.
anger|What the hell?!
neutral|One witness said, quote, God sent us two angels. And at least one had him a .308 caliber flaming sword of justice with a telescopic sight.
neutral|And now the news.
anger|That's disappointing. They could have been a big help to us. I guess we'll just have to do without.
joy|I have a full itinerary here. Here you go.
surprise|Where'd she go?
joy|WooooOOOOOOoooo.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
joy|It's good to see you around the Strip.
neutral|Yes, and they have been for decades now. The hired hands know what they're signing up for - we don't hide anything with fancy talk.
sadness|Why free me now? After what you done? I ain't saying thank you.
disgust|What business is that?
anger|I know something of your reputation with my gang, and I can't be seen working with you. Sorry, but I'll handle this.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
surprise|Hide nor hair of them.
anger|These beasts are slaves to their instincts and hunger for blood. That's good enough an answer for everyone, and it'll do for you too.
surprise|Aha!
joy|Stories of how you saved President Kimball are the talk of the Strip, friend!
anger|All right. I'll let it go - this time.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
neutral|I suspected he'd found a way to access my encrypted databases, but well - this explains it.
joy|I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
joy|I'm sure you'll be fair and equitable, boss.
surprise|Aha!
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
sadness|At least we have the supplies. It's not much, but every little bit counts.
neutral|That's right, get out of here! If I see you ever again, I'll pump you full of lead, you hear?
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
neutral|In possibly related news, local chem dealers report an overall decrease in their standard of living.
joy|Haven't found any Radroaches, so far.
anger|Nobody screws with the Gun Runners and walks away from it!
sadness|They could have programmed me to love. To forgive. But nnoooo...
neutral|Any Legion with you and I'm pulling the trigger.
fear|I don't want any trouble, okay?
neutral|Okay. Anything else?
neutral|Cazadores are extremely deadly, but they are also reclusive. Try looking near the Red Rock's canyons.
disgust|Aside from protecting them from the occasional thug looking to intercept supply shipments, there isn't much to do around here.
neutral|Uhh, hey. Welcome to Red Rock Canyon. You've seemed a little bipolar lately - maybe you're having withdrawal symptoms?
neutral|Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
neutral|Here are our top stories.
neutral|Check your weapons and move up!
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
neutral|Very well. Will there be anything else?
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
joy|They sent their best men to stop the Rangers and 1st Recon, but the Rangers pulled them into a trap at Boulder City and blew them all to hell.
joy|And just in case you're thinking of slipping away, now that you've finally got that Platinum Chip in your hands?
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
neutral|Alright.
neutral|Since Mr. House has helped me in the past, I'll let you help us during the President's visit. However, I will be keeping an eye on you.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
joy|I hope everyone on the surface is like you.
anger|At this point, I'll take anything you can give me. We need more troops, fresh supplies, and medical relief.
neutral|Goodsprings: Rascal.
joy|No, silly! Of course it wasn't always a hotel.
joy|Whoa! Are you like... some kind of crazy person?
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
joy|Machetes at twenty paces, hey? I accept your challenge.
joy|Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
anger|Looks like a party.
surprise|Hell, a good thrashing is what I want to give them but I see your point, kid. Things will never change without us good folks.
surprise|I'll tell the doormen you're cool to pack heat inside - trust me, you're gonna need it.
surprise|Nah, in the way-back we called ourselves the Boot Riders. Silly name, but that's how we rode the Mojave, dig? - on our feet.
disgust|Lem wants to run back to the NCR and turn himself in, spineless bastard.
neutral|Can't help but be impressed with what they're doing here.
anger|Is that a joke? Have you looked around? Massive casualties, constant raids, barely any food or equipment... does that sound alright to you?
anger|Nobody messes with the Kings.
anger|They killed him!
disgust|You bastard!
neutral|I shouldn't have to say this, but please don't bother me until the mission is completed.
neutral|It's a big machine which moves rocks around, piles at a time. It's Pre-War tech, so you need to thump it once in awhile to keep it running.
surprise|Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
neutral|The Reflex Booster does exactly what it says - speeds up your reaction times. For 4,000 caps, I can attach the implant to your central nervous node.
anger|I don't know what you're doing here, but you can just leave. We've got enough problems here.
sadness|There was never any saving her. They'd have taken her where I couldn't follow. What I did... that was the only rescue.
anger|Go East! they say. Scrap lying in the sun for you to grab. Yeah, right.
neutral|I'd rather not go experimenting. Some of these wasteland plants are toxic.
neutral|Goodsprings: Accepted.
anger|Then, in battle against an unimportant tribe, he broke ranks and led his contubernium through a hole in their defenses to capture its chieftain.
anger|I don't think so. If you work for the NCR, you're no better than they are. Flails of God!
neutral|Those are the risks of a hunter's life. I've delivered as promised, but perhaps I should better search for someone with greater resolve and honor?
surprise|Glad that fucker House is gone.
joy|No, silly! Of course it wasn't always a hotel.
joy|It was easy, man. They were going door to door asking if anyone knew any scientists. I said look no further.
anger|Come back when you've destroyed whatever you find down in that bunker.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
joy|Yeah, see... I just needed to escape for a little while. To not think about all this stuff going on here.
joy|Oh, heh. Yeah, that's Mean Sonofabitch. I know the name sounds bad, but he likes it. He's one nasty old coot.
anger|What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
joy|I'm glad to see you.
neutral|At least you asked. More than some that pass through here.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
neutral|Caesar's Legion: Shunned.
neutral|I guess somebody named "Tabitha" led the bunch that freed him. Don't know much more than that.
joy|Samuel Kerr at your service. Me and my daughter Michelle run this fine establishment.
anger|Oh, sure. Lay mines around the arthritic old man who doesn't see so good. Thanks, boss.
neutral|Don't ever say that name again.
sadness|Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for the missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured troopers.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
anger|What have you done?
joy|But try not to get killed anymore.
anger|Got time to save us too, or are you running errands for your NCR masters?
joy|I'll find you eventually, you know.
disgust|Damn Brahmin crap everywhere.
surprise|Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
anger|If there's one thing I won't tolerate, it's working with some dog of the Legion. You've got some explaining to do.
disgust|Better not try that again.
sadness|I'm afraid I won't make it out of here, not without Carlitos. If the Med-X doesn't kill me first, Cachino or another Omerta will.
anger|I don't care what you believe. Now unless there's something else, why don't you just buzz off.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
surprise|Aha!
joy|I hope everyone on the surface is like you.
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
fear|Are you sure he'll be okay with it? Not everyone is crazy about ghouls.
sadness|Mickey is... he's no longer... alive. I'm sorry, but I just can't go on.
disgust|Bad soil and rationed water. It's to be expected around here, but the rationing's off. Worst part is NCR won't admit it.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
anger|We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
neutral|She's been frequenting the square in North Vegas, probably hanging out with street scum. I want to know more about her new "friends."
sadness|I'll always remember you. My memory circuits have almost unlimited capacity.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
neutral|That lying little weasel! I almost fell for it, too! All right, you've got a deal. You can tell Papa I won't support an alliance.
surprise|Aha!
anger|Don't talk to me!
neutral|Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
anger|You are the lowest form of commie scumbag I've ever had the misfortune to lay eyes on!
neutral|Twenty percent it is. Etienne won't like it, but at least our secret will be safe.
fear|Stop it! Help!
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
anger|You and I have got nothing to talk about.
neutral|Yes, the Mormon Fort in Freeside. It's hard to miss.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
fear|I've heard stories about you. No one knows what you'll do next.
neutral|On the far side of the dam, a small building provides access to the power plant below. That is where Oliver hides.
joy|How about that suit Benny wears? If I had a suit like that, the ladies would be all over me. What, you expect a punchline? This guy pays my salary!
neutral|All right. But we'd better not have to have this talk again.
joy|Every day is a good day to die!
surprise|Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
neutral|Eh, it's not my call to make. You'd have to clear it with Ranger Ericsen.
joy|My lucky day, running into our President's savior!
surprise|Wow. I've got to admit, you have completely defied my first impression of you.
joy|You can't hide from me.
surprise|Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
anger|Like I give a shit. Didn't I say get lost, or are you looking for a beating?
surprise|Aha!
neutral|Here's a compensation for your service. I trust that we're in agreement over it.
joy|Things are looking good. With the new resources and support, morale is at the highest it's ever been around here.
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
anger|I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
anger|Well, then, let me educate you: I am the chief of the Great Khans - the Khan of Khans, if you like. This is my tribe and these are my people.
neutral|By all means.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
disgust|Lem wants to run back to the NCR and turn himself in, spineless bastard.
neutral|Think you have what it takes? Hmm, all right. Prove your worth and I'll reward your service.
surprise|Holy shit!
neutral|Caps it is. Will there be anything else?
fear|Look, I've got people to care for. I'm not looking for trouble.
neutral|Why's everything spinning?
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
neutral|One of the officers here, or at Camp McCarran, might be able to tell you more.
anger|You sick, twisted fuck!
neutral|Pretty much what you'd expect. White talked to Hector and then went to talk to Anderson.
neutral|Let's.
neutral|I guess I'll stay. If I left there wouldn't be any coming back. It might be something I'd instantly regret.
neutral|Alright.
anger|Don't you know who I work for?
anger|Goddamn it. This wasn't supposed to be a guess. He might not have done a goddamn thing.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
surprise|The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
anger|Look out!
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
joy|Sure, kid, sure - I can spare a couple. What can I do for you?
sadness|If someone can blow up the Monorail, I guess we're not safe even in the Strip.
disgust|Take your time - the ghoul's not going anywhere.
neutral|There are some fire geckos in the lower levels of the Vault. We need to get them gone so we can get to the sulfur.
sadness|Cool. Maybe later.
anger|If I hear one more loser moan about losing everything they own on the Strip, I may shoot him in the head.
joy|Great! Don't be surprised if you're already last when you return. If I'm right, the troopers will use any excuse to slaughter Legion scum.
anger|I'll kill you!
joy|Here you go, you've earned these.
surprise|The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
joy|You were, really? Okay. For a moment I thought you were going to tighten my screws - like everyone else around here.
anger|What the hell is with those Securitrons? Looks like they got some sort of change or upgrade. I don't like the look of this.
anger|Our main target is the Legion leader at Nelson. Intel has the commander as one Dead Sea. I've uploaded his last known location to your Pip-Boy.
neutral|Other than Tyrone, were any other NCR citizens involved in this smuggling operation?
neutral|As I've told you before, you are contractually obligated to deliver the Chip. Do your job - you have everything to gain.
anger|They can't rush us without eating a good bit of hot lead, but we are in kind of a box canyon. Guess this is as fitting a place for that as any.
anger|Do you have any idea how much effort it took to place a mole at Camp McCarran? What else have you done?
joy|With a smile.
neutral|Can't believe we have patrol duty in the morning...
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
surprise|I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
neutral|Then this is over. Next time I see you, it'll be through my scope.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
neutral|Stick around. We've got some great songs coming up for you.
joy|It's not much, but here's a little something I scraped together for the winner of the contest. Good job, you earned it.
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
anger|If you ever - ever - disobey me again, I will order my Praetorians to hack you to death with their machetes for my entertainment.
joy|Excellent, just let me grab my scalpel and a body bag, and we'll get started.
surprise|Baby, you have got to be joking! Now take your cut and stop being crazy.
fear|Bleeding out pretty bad here!
neutral|Remember the rules: light armor and machetes only. And, of course, to the death.
anger|Luck is for losers, baby. Someone pulled strings.
anger|With Anders out of commission for so long, we're shorthanded on runners, and some backlogs have piled up.
surprise|Grenade!
joy|Camp McCarran is paradise compared to this place. A two-minute monorail and you're on the Strip!
surprise|You're the talk of the day around the casino tables.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
neutral|That looks like all of them.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
anger|Don't talk to me!
surprise|Head voices speak of doggy with squishy brain.
neutral|Thanks, that'll help.
joy|Deathclaws will bleed this sacred ground red! Make your bets, stranger, before it's too late.
disgust|The troopers won't go down into the camp with their comrades at risk. Dirty game the Legion likes to roll out whenever they get a chance.
neutral|No, but it does make it easier to forgive him. He's just misguided.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
anger|I can't believe this shit. Time to die, punk!
anger|Sorry, I'm not in the habit of letting random civilians dictate my troop deployment schedule.
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
anger|That's none of your damn business.
anger|What the fuck you want, huh?
neutral|Then we're finished here.
surprise|Do you want my opinion as a former citizen, or future conqueror? Actually, my opinion's the same either way.
fear|You killed him! What have we done to you?
neutral|All clear!
anger|Grrrraah!
neutral|That day you showed up in Novac, I had a feeling I was supposed to go with you. That it was time to end all this.
neutral|On the day of the Great War, 77 atomic warheads targeted Las Vegas and its surrounding areas.
neutral|Well, thanks for weighing in. Gives me something to think about.
anger|I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
surprise|She is...? Listen, no time to waste. Help her get to Freeside, that's our ticket out of this fucking city.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
anger|What is it?
joy|You're the one who saved us! Thank you.
neutral|Gomorrah is under new management after the sudden departure of Omerta bosses Nero and Big Sal. The Casino's new manager spoke to reporters.
anger|Hell, listen to me talk. Like some damn mother hen.
fear|That's it. What do you think?
joy|I've been here since the first push into Vegas. Back in the day, this camp was the hotspot for conflicts with the Legion, raider tribes, you name it.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
anger|I'm not stupid little girl anymore, you can't talk me out of this!
neutral|Th-thank you! I don't know that we'll ever be able to repay you, but we'll do our best one day once I've found a place to settle.
surprise|What the hell?Is that a half-robot dog?
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
anger|Attack me. Give me license to kill you.
disgust|It's a simple idea: the Army offers fiscal security and generous benefits at the cost of substantial personal risk - if you're on the front line.
anger|Got 'em in my sights!
neutral|Looks like we got them, move fast and look alive.
neutral|And you believed them? Do you have any idea how long we've been fighting those bastards?
joy|As a token of appreciation, this here's the key to the Presidential - best suite in the house. Stay as long as you like, free of charge.
neutral|Then you leave me no choice.
joy|Thanks.
joy|It's cramped in here, sure, but who really needs a fancy room, anyway?
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
neutral|Sure thing.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
neutral|Now getting back to business...
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
joy|I'm harsh on the children, but they'll be excellent Legionaries. I'm quite proud of them.
neutral|Though Arcade had not hoped for an NCR victory, he was proud of his role in the defense of Hoover Dam against the forces of Caesar's Legion.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
joy|Another satisfied customer.
anger|For revenge! The NCR committed an atrocity here, an atrocity that they tried to bury and forget. I'm going to remind them.
surprise|Holy shit!
neutral|Thank you, and good luck.
anger|You going to make fun of me too?
anger|Hey, not so rough, I break easy!
disgust|Look, boss, I appreciate you not making me carry that, but come on.
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
neutral|You're psychotic! Get out of my sight, I have nothing to say to you any more!
fear|Caesar's death is good news for the NCR. For everyone, most likely.
surprise|Got any more of those? I wanna blow something up too!
sadness|I'd rather be anywhere else but here.
joy|They're mostly pretty nice - Poindexter showed me how to make fireworks! Razz kinda scares me sometimes, but I don't mind. He's had a hard life.
neutral|Too bad, baby. Come back when you have the caps. I'll still be here.
surprise|I heard some Squatters talking about some fancy pants Rangers coming into the area soon. Like we need more NCR here.
anger|Look out!
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
neutral|Yeah, well. I'm not a soldier anymore. Those rules don't seem like much of an excuse now.
joy|Hey, there.
neutral|Try "The Gray." Beats me why people go into that forsaken thing. At least with huts and sewers you know they ain't crumbling on top of your head.
anger|You make any trouble for me or my men and I'll make sure you regret if for a very long time. You got that?
joy|This place smells like booze and sex. That's why I always come back.
joy|Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
surprise|You must be new around here. Something I can do for you?
joy|I heard Private Stone turned himself in for stealing my medical supplies. You have my thanks.
neutral|Then let's get this over with.
joy|Alright, we can move on now. Here's the key to the Fire Station.
joy|Maybe one day, stranger, when you've seen all I've seen, done all I've done, you'll sooner trust a Radscorpion than a new face in The Wasteland.
anger|Get lost.
surprise|Aha!
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
anger|Metal men walk no more. Stupid metal men. Head voices don't like metal men!
anger|They killed him!
fear|The Legion is assembling a massive army on the other side of the river. How can we stop an army when we can't even handle their raiding parties?
fear|It was you that rescued President Kimball, wasn't it? You're becoming quite the celebrity already.
neutral|You're no friend to the Great Khans. You should turn around and leave - and if we see you in the Mojave, well... accidents happen.
neutral|I hear the Brahmin ranchers out in Redding are looking for some hard workers, so I might try there first. I hate working with Brahmin, though.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
joy|Wow. Hey, it's you. What are you doing in Bitter Springs?
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
neutral|That's a smart move. The Great Khans look out for their friends.
joy|We should straighten those thugs at Gomorrah.
sadness|As you wish. When Caesar goes to war, we go with him.
anger|They killed her!
surprise|I still can't believe the King agreed to work with the NCR. But he's the King, and the King knows best.
joy|Exactly. Seeing that we're of one mind on this, I'll head out. I got business to take care of.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
neutral|Heard there was an abandoned vault along this mountain ridge, and that the wildlife here had teeth big enough to keep the NCR away.
neutral|I would greatly prefer that you perform this job undetected and without killing anyone, if it can be helped.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|Look out!
neutral|If there's nothing else, then let's get moving.
surprise|Grenade!
disgust|However, as I am by far the most intelligent and resourceful figure on this base, I feel it's safe to say the soldiers here look up to me.
fear|Papa hasn't steered us wrong yet.
neutral|I'm afraid we have no current openings for caravaneers or guards, but I'm in need of a runner.
fear|What do you want with me?
neutral|You can find it in the basement of the burned-out old building at the mouth of the canyon.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
anger|What are you doing here!? I don't want to be near you ever again! Leave, leave... just leave, ok!?
anger|Another glorious day in the U.S. army.
anger|Please tell me that you did not just do what I think you did!
surprise|You have? What are you waiting for, kid? Spill the beans!
anger|My problem? My problem is we're all going to die.
neutral|Goodsprings: Idolized.
anger|Ever since losing its queen, the NCR has been weaker, more diffuse. Democracy has been its weakness, not its strength.
neutral|We have our ears on the radio waves. When the fighting starts you can count on our air support.
neutral|Didn't have a choice. He was confusing the men, and I need to control them or we're just a bunch of disorganized idiots.
joy|There's always more next day.
neutral|The influx of displaced residents to the refugee camp at Bitter Springs has caused a strain on rations there. NCR officials are asking for donations.
anger|What I did to you was rotten, but if you think House, the NCR or Caesar won't kill to put Vegas in their pocket, I really did blow out your brains.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
anger|Oh, they're a shifty pack of rats. If I were you, I'd keep one hand on my wallet and the other on my gun whenever they're around.
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
joy|What are you doing?
anger|Look out!
disgust|You'll pay for that!
disgust|Wouldn't want to live forever if I had to look like a ghoul.
neutral|What did you do?
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
neutral|Looks like we got them, move fast and look alive.
joy|No way I'm going back to prison.
anger|That's not a good idea.
surprise|Oh yeah? I bet you spend most of the time thinking lines rather than putting them to use. That vault merchandise is not on your menu! Next!
sadness|I can't.
joy|Ah, the vaunted hero of the Legion. What can I do for you?
fear|I don't know what you have against the Followers, but I don't want any trouble.
neutral|He won't tolerate any resistance. If he catches wind I've been talking to people, he'll charge me with sedition.
joy|Ahh, sarsaparilla. That's just what this dry old throat needs.
sadness|Okay then. Job'll be waiting if you change your mind.
neutral|Nice speech. Take a hike.
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
anger|Had enough?
anger|Once I'm done here, I hope they assign me to find the son of a bitch that took down our President.
neutral|Do I seem worried to you, baby? Sometimes a cat just needs room to swing. He'll be back, sure as a conga drum's got a groovy beat.
sadness|There are so many refugees to care for.
neutral|Good work, stranger. The Thorn will nurture these eggs until their hatchlings are ready to bleed for us.
neutral|When Vulpes Inculta drove the NCR from Searchlight by clever means, Caesar himself ordered me to set up this camp and harass the Profligates!
anger|I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
neutral|I'm listening.
joy|You've got a sharp eye on you. I take it you like guns, huh? Question is, can you handle more than just a weapon...
disgust|Shit. I didn't even get a shot at that Nephi b-b-bastard before he went down.
surprise|Damn, be careful with those things!
neutral|Alright.
sadness|It's this place - my inspiration ebbs and I don't know how to stop it! I can't feel the warmth anymore...
disgust|Ahh... I see. Unfortunately you're experience with "medicology" isn't going to be any use to me here.
neutral|But I've come to believe that there are things nobody can stop. I thought for sure that's what we'd finally come up against today.
neutral|Judging by the lack of blood, I take it the coward Oliver fled rather than face me. No matter.
anger|No. It's too risky, we'll all end up dead.
surprise|Aha!
surprise|The owner of the Vault was murdered. I thought we were safe inside the Strip.
surprise|I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
joy|You can't hide from me.
joy|I hope you're doing well, friend!
neutral|VStoryEventCaesarKilled to 2.
disgust|I heard Private Stone was caught stealing medical supplies. I always hated that guy.
fear|I hope my dad doesn't find out how much money those hookers cost me.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
neutral|VStoryEventCampGolf set to 0.
neutral|Given that I had to make do with buggy software, the outcome could have been worse. I nearly died as it was.
neutral|How dare you insult the honor of the brothers and sisters who died there!
neutral|Even though you already have a plan, I may have some information that you might find useful.
joy|One of these days, Red Lucy's going to show off her Deathclaws.
joy|Good, my fists were getting bored.
anger|Flank 'em!
neutral|You're making a mistake. I want to be a part of this.
joy|After that the Legion's forces were in disarray and tried to retreat. However, our forces advanced rapidly and routed them. And that was that.
joy|Saw a monster rip a man in half at The Thorn.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
fear|If House is dead, how'd the lights get turned on in his place, huh?
neutral|Good. I look forward to hearing of your progress.
joy|After I win big, I'm going to buy my friends dinner at that fancy Gor-mant restaurant. I saw ads for it back home.
joy|Make Vegas a town I woulda been proud of, baby. Let it swing.
neutral|We were looking for a GECK to save the village of Arroyo. Eventually, we did. Nuked an oil rig in the process.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
neutral|Go up to the visitor center and speak to Ranger Grant. He's in charge of security during the president's visit. Dismissed.
surprise|I've never seen a robot like that before.
neutral|Freeside: Vilified.
joy|I was elected to this post seven years ago. I'm the third NCR representative to serve here in Vegas.
neutral|Followers: Rascal.
joy|It instills a certain... robust obedience.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
neutral|Holy hell, that's a lot of energy weapons. Guess we dropped the ball on that one.
neutral|Fine, but I'd still like to when we get a chance.
neutral|Followers: Wild Child.
sadness|No time to talk. I have to keep watch for Legion raiding parties.
fear|Take him out? Jesus... okay, well, if you think that's the best way to deal with this. I'll send him up to his room, you can ambush him there.
anger|One of those beasts cut my friend in half! How the hell did they escape from Red Lucy?
fear|This isn't like the sims!
anger|Made me look! Made me mad!
neutral|But... I don't have anything. I thought you were my friend!
surprise|Aha!
neutral|I get it, you're sore. A crumb's life is painful, full of disappointments.
joy|Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
fear|I'm sorry boss... Sometimes I just can't control myself. I dunno what's wrong with me. I swear, I can turn this around. Just gimme another chance.
anger|You and I have got nothing to talk about.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
neutral|All right.
disgust|Sure, I'll just pull a toolbox out from behind a conveniently-placed rock and get to work.
surprise|My god!
disgust|Then why are you in here bothering me instead of out there hunting them?
joy|Perhaps I'll have Captain Pappas keep an eye on you. For your own safety, of course.
surprise|All hell broke loose when the creatures escaped from The Thorn!
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
anger|I've got the Legion at Nelson breathing down my neck and not enough men or supplies to get this camp into fighting shape so we can strike back.
joy|My cousin and his wife are a fastidious couple. She's fast and he's hideous.
surprise|I've never a dog like that. Who thinks up these things?
anger|The ground in Forlorn Hope was soaked red, from the blood of our own people!
anger|They killed her!
fear|Looks like Mr. House run out of luck, huh?
surprise|Stealth field is stable, and the readings are clean. Gamma wave activity is... zero? Odd, but everything looks right.
anger|Someone's been coming out of the mountains at night, stealing supplies and picking off my people.
neutral|They're not going to like this. We're given a chance when we're young to choose whether to stay. If we do, it's supposed to be for life.
surprise|Huh. I guess it's all right, then.
neutral|They're part of the deal, the Thaler Act. We work the fields while they protect the crops and the water.
fear|I knew if I didn't get way the hell away from New Reno, he'd run me down like a dog.
neutral|If they won't listen, do what you can to make them listen. The dead need to be avenged.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
anger|What was that for?
anger|Don't just stand there looking stupid.
surprise|Grenade!
neutral|Have a discount, friend. I can't wait to see what you do with these, next.
surprise|What in the goddamn...?
anger|You'd better get out of here.
anger|Hey! That don't belong to you, so keep your grubby mitts off it!
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
joy|I can't imagine this place will ever disappear.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
neutral|Your belongings will be returned to you when you leave.
fear|The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
joy|Thanks.
neutral|Well, I have a bomb here that can be put on the vertibird that will detonate at a certain altitude, but it's a little unstable and dangerous.
joy|I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
neutral|I'll need at least 100 pieces to have enough for the bullets.  I'll cash in whatever you've got until we have enough.  Good luck.
joy|The crowd loves your bravery.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
surprise|Your robot looks worth quite a few caps.
anger|They killed him!
joy|After what you did getting my misfits whipped into shape? Yeah, I can spare a couple of boys for Bitter Springs. I'll issue the dispatch orders.
anger|What the hell?!
anger|I'm not scared of you!
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
joy|You talking about Mr. Isaac? Damn, baby, when you bring them in, you bring them *in!* That cat's gonna bring me money like you wouldn't believe.
neutral|Very well.
anger|All right, but don't let it happen again!
neutral|If you want to do some good, head up to Camp Forlorn Hope. I'll mark it on your map for you.
surprise|Aha!
disgust|I don't have any compelling reason to trust you, given your behavior. So no, I'm not really inclined to give you a job.
anger|I'm done being nice. If you don't hand Ringo over soon, I'm going to get my friends and we're burning this town to the ground, got it?
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
anger|You know what I'd be real excited about? If you'd showed up and saved me before they smashed my legs.
neutral|Anything else?
anger|What the fuck did we do to the Sarge, anyway?
sadness|Oh. Oh, I see. Well... thank you for saving one of them, at least.
anger|Just keep on walking.
anger|Had enough?
neutral|Was there something else you needed?
neutral|We were east of Vegas when the first Securitron we ever saw rolled up on us. We junked it in a minute flat.
anger|You? How could you be...? Oh Swank, you finky bastard...
joy|Those Legion beasts needed to be put down, like the vermin they are!
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
surprise|The Kings got hit hard. I don't know how many of them are still alive, if any.
surprise|Put that down!
anger|Fuck off! I ain't helping you!
anger|Tangle with the Gun Runners and it's the last thing you'll do.
joy|Another satisfied customer.
joy|My buddies at Camp McCarran are breathing easy now that the Fiends' leader is dead.
neutral|It's also said that he's been around since the war, standing a lonely vigil, waiting for someone to come and take the treasure off his hands.
sadness|This spirit of forgiveness you're showing me... it's enough to make a player rethink what it means to win. You're 18 karat, baby. Catch you later.
neutral|Wasn't real popular, though. Even overheard my C.O. complain about him once.
neutral|VStoryEventKhans set to 0.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
anger|Are you fucking kidding me?
joy|It's amazing that Kimball managed to survive.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
disgust|How much ass did you have to kick to get Papa Khan to like you so much?
anger|Enough! You were supposed to be helping them. It's best if you just leave now.
neutral|It pays like ass, but it's hard to get other work with my skill set.
anger|What the hell do you want?
neutral|The president's Vertibird exploded in midair as he departed following the address. Investigators say the explosion was not an accident.
neutral|Don't expect to hold this place for very long, however. The NCR will be back.
joy|Where did you get this? You know what, it doesn't even matter. Thank you. This will be a tremendous help.
anger|You dared go against The Thorn, and now you'll pay for that!
neutral|You'd know better than I would. But you must be remarkable, for Caesar to take such an interest.
fear|Do I hear beeping, boss? I think I hear beeping.
neutral|The quarry just north of here is full of Deathclaws, so there's bound to be an egg or two in there somewhere.
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
neutral|Yeah, it's pretty far out, right? Fixating on old technology just doesn't seem very relevant to most people's lives.
surprise|I heard some Squatters talking about some fancy pants Rangers coming into the area soon. Like we need more NCR here.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
fear|I don't know. I mean, I'd go myself, but what if they said no? The Khans wouldn't take me back, and then I'd have nobody.
neutral|She's locked the bedroom door - like that's going to stop me. I was... I've got a gun, I'm going to make her give it to me!
sadness|There's an opportunity for profit anywhere, uh? Even if it means preying on the helpless. Okay, you... shuckster - 150 caps each if they are good.
joy|Good job. I need to work out some last minute details with our new clients, but after that we'll head back to the Rush.
anger|Fucking geckos.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
anger|I don't have anything more to say to you. You can show yourself out.
neutral|Bad weeds don't die easy. Still, things will be safer now that you've taught a lesson to those crazies.
joy|Listen, warrior. There're two kinds of folks. You load your gun like an ordinary man, or you load it like a devil.
joy|My vault runs deep and wide! It's filled with corridors and rooms that go far.
joy|Hey there, girlie. You here to party with the Powder Gangers?
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
joy|And like we agreed, here's your fee. 3% of the cut comes to 100 caps. Don't spend them all in one place now - unless it's right here!
joy|Lanius is savage. Savagely loyal, too, but only to me - he has no love for my Legion. But this has its uses.
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
joy|The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
anger|What do you need?
surprise|Dude! What a total haul! No way that's copasheshy. Yeah, okay, me and Diana got your back. No sweat.
joy|I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
surprise|Might be slightly useful, if you're looking to defend the Strip from Caesar's Legion or the NCR. Or maybe both?
anger|Get your own!
fear|Please, no more!
anger|What the hell?!
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
surprise|What? You've got to be kidding me... Fuck, why do I always gotta fix someone else's crap around here?
neutral|Was the Courier male or female, and what kind of karma did the Courier have?
disgust|The class of people I'm forced to associate with these days just keeps falling.
joy|I've been here over a year now. Though I'm not one to get tied for long.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
neutral|Now you're talking. One thing you should know, first, though. I asked you about the Brotherhood because I'm one of them.
neutral|Here's your chip. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|Oh I made an impression all right! The dent in that mattress was permanent!
fear|The main terminal is typically unlocked, but is also in the middle of a major thoroughfare, you'll have to be stealthy to access it.
joy|Here, in town, he's got few of his armed men to protect him. I just got to find out what's he up to and then I'll know where to hit him hard.
neutral|The NCR and the Followers have a cool relationship at the moment. We see them as oppressive, and they view us as anarchists.
joy|That comedian you mean? Yeah, he practically begged me to hire him. Didn't even haggle. Here's your 5%.
neutral|They'll be in like new condition and then we can use our loader to make fresh ammo from spent brass.
surprise|Grenade!
anger|What do you want?
sadness|I managed to get clearance to carry out the mission anyway, but with greatly reduced support.
joy|Do that again!
sadness|Quartermaster Mayes has been complaining to me nonstop about the lack of supplies, but unfortunately we aren't getting a resupply any time soon.
joy|There's nothing else like The Thorn!
neutral|You can't let indeterminate variables rattle around in your equations like that. They have to be accounted for, one way or another.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
anger|You take that back!
fear|You're not going to cause any problems, right?
disgust|That's enough excitement for one day.
anger|Are you fucking kidding me?
surprise|Everyone's talking about Hoover Dam nowadays. I wish the battle would just happen already. The suspense is killing me.
neutral|You did it! Thank you so much!
joy|I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
anger|Enough! How dare you compare Caesar's finest to this tribe of savages? The mightiest Great Khan is scarcely a match for a Legion recruit!
surprise|You're wasting no time in making a name for yourself around here, huh?
surprise|I heard Mr. House's done for. I hope the Sewers don't turn for the worse.
anger|I'm out of here.
neutral|Okay, well... I guess I'll just keep waiting. Sorry to bother you.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
joy|Excellent! Maximal reward for minimal work.
neutral|I don't think they're here for us. Too bad. Would've made me feel good about myself.
disgust|I can tell you they're a bunch of big dumb jerks with no appreciation for art. I mean, can you believe their initiation?
joy|Us NCR folk got to stick together, even if the Strip is the safest place in New Vegas.
neutral|Lotta folks come to New Vegas and lose everything in Freeside or the Strip. They get hungry, desperate, and try to take our hard work.
surprise|Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
neutral|They got parents? I don't know. Wish they did so they'd leave me be.
anger|I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
joy|Fine. Are you ready?
anger|Die, infidel!
joy|Traveling into the Strip just got a lot easier now that the Fiends' leaders are dead.
neutral|You can have it if you get me out of here alive. I won't have a use for it when I get back to California.
anger|
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|No, just because you secured the aid of the Khans, assuming they don't try to kill us, don't think the Brotherhood will be so easily swayed.
joy|You're the one who saved us! Thank you.
joy|Go all the way down to the Vault's main hub. Your room's in the hallway to the left. Enjoy your stay!
neutral|I'm trained as a spotter, too. If you're looking through a scope, I can find your targets for you.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
joy|So I hear Mr. House runs the Strip. He took it over from the last guy, Mr. Mob-Infested Hellhole.
neutral|I don't blame anybody for it. There's so much chaos when you're fighting, you're lucky not to shoot your own guys.
joy|With all the people passing through lately, the town's been doing better than, well, ever.
anger|No!
sadness|Terrible thing, what happened to the Hostetlers.
anger|You bastard! Those ghouls declared me a Saint!
joy|Confident, I like that.
joy|Thanks.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
joy|I've been around long enough to observe patterns of human behavior. Physical and mental anguish are especially exciting to explore.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
neutral|Here's the key to their collars. You want to take those off before you've gone far, trust me.
anger|Nobody fucks with the NCR and lives to brag about it. You're dead, punk!
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
anger|'B-b-bout time Cook-Cook g-g-g-got what was c-coming to him.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
neutral|The Strip: Accepted.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
joy|Well, well! If it isn't the Vault explorer himself! Welcome back.
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
neutral|Family's just what the world throws on our shoulders without our say or opinion.
neutral|Crocker. Can. Kiss. My. Sweet. Republic. Ass.
joy|Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
sadness|It's the room with the double doors, can't miss it. Maybe you'll find something we can show to Mr. House and get him arrested.
neutral|Talk to Jack, he'd be happy to sell you some top-quality chems. He'll even give you a discount.
anger|You're just as bad as the NCR or the Legion. What did the Followers ever do to you?
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
anger|I never trusted those Omerta punks, even if I like their girls.
neutral|Oh, and standard arena rules still apply. You don't get to wear armor and you get only a machete for a weapon.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
disgust|Less hide-and-seek, more shoot-and-kill.
surprise|Aha!
neutral|And don't get any dreamy notions about playing the hero and dragging those boys out. You'll get swarmed. Now let's go.
joy|You're a model citizen, thank you.
anger|Fuck it, you're more trouble than you're worth.
neutral|Good, you just stand there and listen, then, that'll make this go faster.
joy|Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
anger|We keep knowledge they must never have.
joy|Both of them? Wow, that's very resourceful. Thank you.
sadness|I wish I was stationed at McCarran. I heard they still get to hit the Strip for R&R. We haven't had R&R in ages.
disgust|Murderer!
joy|I can answer whatever questions you'd like... provided your query is limited to REPCONN history, research and development, or RobCo.
neutral|Moving on...
anger|Look out!
anger|No!
anger|Come out and face your death!
surprise|Sometimes it does feel that way. I feel more like a mortician than a doctor.
neutral|Not all technology, mind you. You don't see them raiding hospitals to cart away Auto-Docs or armfuls of prosthetic organs.
neutral|Here.
neutral|There aren't enough of us here to make a real impact on the NCR, and the Khans probably hate the NCR more than we do. Strength in numbers, they say.
neutral|Fine. But if you make any new friends in there, all bets are off.
sadness|Well... I guess that makes some sense. After all, you're the first person who's set foot in there in over two hundred years.
surprise|That NCR prez survived a Legion hit? Wouldn'ta guessed.
anger|Watch it.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
anger|Bear in mind how much you have to make up for, how much you have to prove yourself in your next task...
fear|How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
joy|They have a fantastic menu at the diner.
neutral|Then I bid you "Vale" - until we meet again.
anger|You better scram before I sic the entire Strip after you.
fear|I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
joy|Yeah, you did good finding him. Okay, if you want a little work, I think I can find you something.
neutral|And?
joy|You could run? I am trying to kill you, after all.
neutral|Went up there one time to try and... you know... meet my neighbors in the biz. But you know, I don't think they took me very seriously.
joy|Good to see a friend of our government.
anger|Look out!
disgust|You insult our hosts, where I wouldn't dare to. You might want to watch that talk around Papa Khan.
fear|I should've known that Mr. House wouldn't have sent just anybody. Anything I might I offer to, well, encourage discretion?
joy|Well, unless you want to go in there and clean out that camp for me, I guess this should be more than enough for now.
disgust|The "great" republic couldn't find enough soliders to liberate this camp, so they sent you? Pathetic.
anger|Don't act like you'd be doing me a favor. I don't give a fuck.
neutral|Looks like we got them, move fast and look alive.
sadness|No... Joana! It can't be! She didn't deserve this, she didn't, you hear?
anger|Sit down, hey? Don't keep me waiting.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
surprise|Where'd she go?
neutral|If you see Alice again, please, tell her we won't hold it against her. Tell Alice that we love her.
anger|Look, we are going, okay? So, leave us be.
neutral|All matches continue until one side is dead. No exceptions.
neutral|The things the Profligates will build, to spy on us like cowards with little machines!
disgust|Personally, I think they're kind of creepy, but Papa likes the fact that they get hopped up on Psycho and harass NCR patrols.
fear|How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
anger|Those Legion bastards aren't going to know what hit them!
joy|Certainly, which type of ammo would you like?
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
sadness|I wish we were back at our Vault.
joy|Okay! You know where to go. See you soon!
joy|Wow, I didn't expect to see you here. What can I do for you?
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
fear|I give up!
disgust|You'll pay for that!
sadness|Can you spare some caps, mister?
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
surprise|I've never a dog like that. Who thinks up these things?
surprise|Aha!
anger|Kill that son of a bitch!
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
joy|You think I give a shit? Has it crossed your mind that Alice is all the way in this with me?
anger|There we go!
fear|Think about it. No more trading guns for food. Total self-sufficiency. It's what we always wanted.
joy|Whatever your motivation was, I think we owe you a debt.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
surprise|Hey!
disgust|We'll be lucky if the men don't throw down their guns and surrender as the Legion approaches. I guess there's nothing to be done about it now.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|Even the stupid NCR is investing in new research. We're getting left in the dust.
anger|It's not going to happen again. That's all I have to say about it.
anger|Bitter Springs happened. Women and children died when the NCR attacked the Great Khans there, and the NCR just pretends it never happened.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|I don't wanna fucking hear it. You've lost the trust of the family. Goodbye, I hope Hell isn't too hot for you.
neutral|Their leaders have on occasion shown brilliance, their rangers in particular have adapted well to our strategies.
fear|We need more firepower!
surprise|Aha!
anger|I've heard of you. Just remember who's side you're on out there.
fear|Cooke is going to get us all killed.
neutral|You're right.  I suppose we could refurbish used and damaged weapons to fill the order.
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
neutral|So I command what's left. Under the wise leadership of Centurion Aurelius, of course.
neutral|Too bad for me that the "professional" part isn't working out so good. But, I love gambling, so I'm here to stay on the Strip until they kick me out.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
anger|Fucking Mr. House was holding the cards the whole goddamn time. Him and his little errand girl.
anger|No!
neutral|The notes say to look around Nellis Air Force Base. He suggests going through filing cabinets and computers in the commanding officer's quarters.
joy|Hey, you're a damn fine soldier, and word on the grapevine is that you're already some kind of hero. You got yourself a deal.
surprise|So far working with the NCR hasn't been too bad. If anything, things seem to be getting better.
fear|It seems like for every Legion soldier we kill, two more take his place. How many of them are there?
neutral|With the help of Bill Ronte, we were able to install a water pump just west of here, but the Kings quickly took control of the pump.
neutral|All right. Is there anything else I can do for you?
neutral|One such loose end is a gang known as the Great Khans. Have you heard of them?
joy|Fuck that Caesar dog! I'm going to drink in your name, all night!
anger|Weird's just normal when normal decides to start taking notice of things. You just think about that.
neutral|Boomers: Idolized.
anger|Had enough?
joy|Speaking of - that crazy lightshow over the Fort, what the fuck was that, some kind of thumb from God you called down? Amazing, fucking amazing.
anger|What do you need?
anger|Locked and loaded!
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
neutral|To keep it out of people's hands? That clearly hasn't worked. To defend ourselves? We can't compete with the NCR's numbers. Or the Legion's.
surprise|Hey!
neutral|Ooo, do I get a prize if I answer right?
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
joy|You know what? Why the hell not. There are plenty of places out there to explore, and I'm kinda tired of being stuck in this house.
anger|We'll do whatever it takes to get the President through this visit in one piece.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
disgust|You weren't much help, but thanks anyway... I guess.
surprise|I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
fear|Ahhh!...
joy|I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
anger|Trouble is, the Chip don't fit any computer I've found. Must require special hardware.
neutral|I guess they brought us here. One less Legion raiding party running loose now. Never a bad thing, you can take my word for that.
disgust|Without Mr. House, we'd still be wearing gecko skins, poking around the ruins with pointy sticks and scalping people for giggles.
joy|Got one!
anger|What was that for?
neutral|He's killed more than a few people to collect as many of those caps as he can, and your ignorance as to what they are won't protect you.
neutral|Okay, but keep it quick. I'd like to get out of here before the Legionnaires come to check on me.
neutral|We can't have wastelanders popping in here for a free meal, so my squad and I are assigned to keep things from going to hell.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|There are places I've never been to that'd be too dangerous for just me. What do you think? Maybe we could travel together, help each other out.
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
surprise|Sounds like the NCR and the Legion are both gearing up for a fight. We've been seeing a lot more soldiers around.
disgust|Don't get me wrong - that resort of theirs is strictly ring-a-ding. But my guts say, "don't go in the basement."
joy|One day I'll get to see Deathclaws tear through Fiends!
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
anger|You want to start something, baby?
joy|Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
anger|We'll get 'em.
neutral|These are people that both hate us *and* outgun us. There can be no compromise. Anything else?
disgust|Murderer!
neutral|I... may have overheard some things at Gomorrah that I passed on to the NCR. That's all! Honest.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
joy|New gal, eh? The more the merrier around here!
surprise|I heard Mr. House's done for. I hope the Sewers don't turn for the worse.
fear|What did I do wrong?
neutral|Of course! We prefer bulk donations of 500 caps - it's apparently a lot easier on the accountants, for some reason.
neutral|Can barely see the street.
fear|I'd rather not take the chance.
surprise|Sure, whatever you want.
anger|Shit, we haven't had a proper resupply since god knows when. Last time I sent troops out to find supplies, they never returned.
fear|Forlorn Hope was massacrated. How are the troops going to defend poor sobs like us?
surprise|House? More like House light. I heard he got himself unplugged.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
sadness|Maybe I should. Don't suppose you know anyplace a feller with a guitar might find a job, huh?
anger|You dirty coward!
neutral|See you around.
surprise|Aha!
neutral|Ladies and gentlemen, this next song goes out from me to you.
neutral|Very well. You may proceed.
joy|Another satisfied customer.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
fear|This is an unexpected variable. I had hoped to coast on an easy wave of mediocrity to a cushy government pension.
neutral|Once you're done thinking, talk to Lily.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
anger|You want a reason, how about four?
neutral|Boomers: Vilified.
fear|Some of the other guys told me that the Legion troops eat their own dead to gain their strength, but they're kidding, right?
neutral|I've calculated and re-calculated these probabilities. Kimball must live.
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
neutral|It might not look like much, but it's what keeps us Westside locals independent.
sadness|But their rangers are few, and this General Oliver we face is not their best. I regret not being able to face Hanlon, the one who led them last time.
joy|Thanks again for saving my ass.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
neutral|Hurry back. Never have we been so close.
joy|I heard you helped destroy the Legion at Nelson. Thanks!
anger|Is someone looking for a paddling?
surprise|You would? You really would?
fear|Need to regroup!
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
anger|Oh what the hell? The bug went offline! Dammit!
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
joy|Hey, It's great what you're doing for The Thorn, way to go!
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
neutral|Good news, indeed. If only the same could be said for the west.
neutral|I feel so bad. I think it's time we reconsider, baby.
surprise|Aha!
anger|I won't hear any more talk against Caesar or his alliance. The Great Khans will answer Caesar's call to war, and the NCR will pay for their crimes.
anger|They killed her!
joy|This is more than I could have hoped for! It almost seems too good to be true, but the details are all here.
neutral|Huh...? Hnngk!
disgust|Good god, no. Look, don't worry about symptoms, just ask around and see if anyone has noticed anything suspicious.
fear|Ahhh! Please don't kill me, I swear I'll have - wait. You... you don't work for Mr. Bishop, do you?
anger|
neutral|If I compell the NCR to retreat, Kimball will be the sacrifice offered to the gods, so decent NCR citizens can get on with their lives.
neutral|You ain't too smart, are you? Okay, let's dance.
neutral|They're based out of the old fort in Freeside. They supposedly helped the NCR out at some point, but they go their own way now.
surprise|In Rome I found a template for a society equal to the challenges of the post-apocalyptic world - a society that could and would survive.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|Fair enough. Here, Rey! Mama's got something for you.
anger|I said fuck off.
surprise|The owner of the Vault was murdered. I thought we were safe inside the Strip.
neutral|They're a rowdy bunch, and pride themselves as warriors. The dark leather and horned helmets they wear are pretty distinctive.
anger|We'll get 'em.
anger|I'll kill you!
anger|Caesar's veterans will arrive from Arizona soon, and there will be no stopping our victory.
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
surprise|Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
disgust|Try robbing me, will you?
joy|I don't know how we pulled this off, for a minute there I thought we were not going to make it.
surprise|Diane handles most of the transactional elements of this little enterprise, but I'm always in the market for new recipes if you've got the spark.
neutral|Leave none alive!
neutral|This is quite a journey you're going on, then. Must be an interesting relationship to have brought you all this way.
sadness|It's just something I'm not ready to discuss. With you or anybody.
anger|I'm not going to talk to you!
neutral|The clamor of our bloodthirsty crowds reaches every corner of The Wasteland, but I'll pretend that your ignorance doesn't offend me, stranger.
sadness|You're behaving very rudely. I wouldn't hide from you, if our positions were reversed.
neutral|We can't survive like this - there are too many of us and we don't have the resources. And maybe it's the right thing to do.
joy|You're the one who busted those assholes at Gomorrah, huh? Good work!
joy|So when Cooke told me his plan, I spread the info to anyone that might be useful.
joy|Just thought you'd like to know. Okay, I'm getting Carlitos as far away from here as possible. Hope to see you again, bye!
anger|Ah, hello. I trust you have something to report concerning the Freeside situation?
joy|Thanks. I only wish some of the soldiers under my command would share some of it.
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|Well he mostly stays out of the way, which is a good thing. He'd probably end up doing some real damage if he tried to make himself useful.
surprise|You've beat Night Stalkers, right? We don't see that often down here.
anger|Flank 'em!
joy|Uh... yeah, sure, no problem.
sadness|Here. This will unlock the supply caches we left in caves around these mountains. You might get some use out of them.
neutral|Yeah, but those are the rules.
neutral|Sure do. Had a wife for awhile - tribal girl, really pretty eyes - but she's been gone a long time now.
joy|Thanks.
neutral|Normally, I oversee company operations at the Hub in California. However, the New Vegas branch has been underperforming in recent years.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
anger|Keep that up, human…
neutral|Simple - you can't bring guns into the casino, that's why. They'll strip you to your fists.
joy|I'll clue you in, guaranteed - every question answered. This can be the start of a beautiful friendship.
neutral|That's all I have for you. This is Mr. New Vegas, wishing you ladylike luck tonight.
surprise|Aha!
neutral|VStoryEventHanlon set to 0.
neutral|Can't believe we have patrol duty in the morning...
neutral|I'm not. Always figured this was how it was gonna end for me. Just didn't know when.
anger|Add to that every Chairman in this joint is armed, and not with some hold-out peashooter like maybe you smuggled through security.
fear|Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
anger|Like I said, I got no reason to take your charity. Not till I know you better.
neutral|I can't reach through this monitor and compell you to follow instructions, but know this - if you disappoint me, you will pay for it.
surprise|That's excellent news! So they'll help us?
anger|Duck and cover!
sadness|I still haven't found my lucky helmet yet.
sadness|I'm a much better tactician than you. It's all in the brain, you see.
anger|Great. You and every other asshole around here. If you grow a heart anytime soon, I'll be around.
disgust|Disappointed? We call 'em the Misfits for a reason. They're undisciplined, lazy, and they have absolutely no espirit de corps.
joy|You are an angel. I can't wait to see you again!
anger|You and I have got nothing to talk about.
surprise|Holy shit!
anger|And then the fight started.
anger|Look out!
anger|I'm sick of the sob stories you hear around here. If you don't know when to stop gambling, that's no one's fault but your own.
anger|I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|What's a pretty girl like you doing with someone like this?
anger|We'll get 'em.
joy|Hey. Anything going on?
anger|Wish the Followers would get me some better armor.
neutral|So long, stranger.
sadness|Don't feel bad if you don't defeat me. I am one of the most advanced military robots available.
anger|That goes both ways. I joined up with you to kill legionaries. Sooner we get back to that, sooner we can have an understanding.
joy|The maize is doing well in this soil.
anger|Time for some get-even.
surprise|Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
joy|Outstanding! You have no idea how much this means to me, but I think this little beauty will give you an idea.
joy|I bet NCR troops can't wait to clean the sewers.
surprise|Aha!
disgust|For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
disgust|You know, I was just talking about trash, and here you are.
surprise|That's sounding dangerously close to a plan, boss.
surprise|We had you and the whore clocked from the start, but we thought Carlitos would be long gone by now.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
neutral|There's an old wasteland legend that says somewhere out there is a fabulous treasure from before the war.
surprise|Profit? What sort of profit do you have in mind that would compensate for your lives.
surprise|Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
neutral|Okay, then.
anger|My buddies at McCarran will find the asshole that destroyed our Monorail.
joy|Private Sexton was thinking of having a contest to see who can kill the most Legion. I wonder if he ever got that going.
anger|Solid arc, check. Lob 'em up and over, people!
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
neutral|Good luck to ya.
anger|There they are! Get them, Leo!
anger|That's not a good idea.
neutral|The Raiders are mostly gone now and it's easy enough to get a job at one of the mills or farms. But now there's taxes and laws and other things.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
joy|A beautiful thing. Saved a little blast powder here, hid a makeshift weapon there, and one day I orchestrated a little symphony for the  NCR.
neutral|Let's see what you've got.
surprise|People lived in here for hundreds of years, can you imagine?
fear|Some of the other guys told me that the Legion troops eat their own dead to gain their strength, but they're kidding, right?
joy|Thanks.
neutral|Hey, so where are you headed, anyway?
neutral|We'll know in a second. I wanted to talk to you.
neutral|Outside New Vegas, at what was once called Nellis Air Force Base, resides an unusual tribe known as the Boomers.
neutral|I kept him secret, but I think somebody told on me.
neutral|Several unidentified aircraft were spotted flying over the REPCONN test site by a local crackpot. He spoke to a toy bear near one of our microphones.
anger|There are rumors that the White Gloves might be this lost tribe. Maybe you can help them find themselves.
fear|Yes, I think so... But, please, uh, keep quiet about it. Without inspiration I am as good as a tumbleweed drifting in the barren wasteland.
neutral|I ain't waiting all day, baby.
anger|Now the Rangers use the old resort, and we grunts get to live in tents. Fucking typical.
anger|Who the fuck are you?
joy|You're a model citizen, thank you.
surprise|You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
neutral|I'm sure that we can.
neutral|There's no controlling war. No sense regretting what you can't stop.
fear|Careful!
joy|You're a model citizen, thank you.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
joy|I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
anger|Then get your ass back into town before talking to me. I wanna know you're serious about this.
fear|House is dead, wonder if Motor-Runner will let us hit the strip now.
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
sadness|Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
neutral|Move up to the next position.
neutral|I'm not convinced that the Nightstalker mutation is a natural one, and I need someone to investigate their lair for proof.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
surprise|You're back. Any progress on saving our skins?
neutral|I've been diverting half of my men to the tower next to this one. It's a bit of a swim, but the enemy hasn't sealed those pipes yet.
joy|Are you okay?
sadness|Well, I was born in a little town out Montana way. Me and Ma didn't have much, ever since my pa up and left.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
joy|Ha ha ha! Okay - why don't you help me out and in the meantime I will think about where to... take advantage of your skills.
neutral|Be warned, my Geckos are the toughest you'll ever face.
anger|I should make you pay for your crimes!
neutral|After I fixed HELIOS One and basically saved the NCR from the dumbshits who run it, I got myself a little promotion. Now I run the whole shebang.
anger|NCR's order? Don't make me laugh, stranger. We work this land, we own these streets, and we yank up the bad weeds ourselves, got it?
neutral|If that's true, then there's nothing else for it. My men and I will hold out as long as we can.
neutral|Why is good help so impossible to find?
anger|I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
anger|Flank 'em!
anger|What makes you think I give a damn about you?
neutral|Ordering the occupation of Hoover Dam was his first act of office. As water and electricity flowed to NCR cities, his popularity soared.
neutral|All right, what is it you wanted?
neutral|Some say it's old Festus that does it, hoping someone will finally collect enough caps to earn the treasure.
joy|It's good to see such an outstanding hero of the NCR. What can I do for you, my friend?
neutral|All right, then. Come and talk to me when you do.
sadness|The Strip ain't nothing but a monster. Chews folks up, sucks out their caps, and spits 'em back out.
anger|My buddies at McCarran will find the asshole that destroyed our Monorail.
neutral|We need to get to the camp before they do!
anger|I hit what I was aiming for. Guess you had brains to spare. Or are you just thick-skulled?
neutral|Not this time. The dam contains tunnels to its heart, overlooked by the NCR... now occupied by the Legion.
surprise|Aha!
disgust|The NCR is a loose conglomerate of individuals looking out for themselves. It's lost virtue. No one cares about the collective, the greater good.
joy|Another satisfied customer.
joy|You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
fear|We need more firepower!
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
neutral|They stood and watched as their fellows were butchered, crucified, and burned, one by one.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
surprise|House? More like House light. I heard he got himself unplugged.
neutral|I think it is safe to move up.
neutral|The quality of the Gun Runners' armaments is due to their manufacturing process. They craft all weapons on-site.
surprise|Hmm... you look like you could handle yourself in a fix. All right, I'll tell you what. Anders, one of my best runners, is overdue to report back.
neutral|Name your challenge.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
neutral|I want you to destroy whatever you find in there. And then I want you to come back here and tell me about it.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
joy|House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
anger|You dirty coward!
neutral|Oh no, dearie, three makes a crowd.
neutral|Have a seat. This will take awhile.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
anger|We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
anger|Once I'm done here, I hope they assign me to find the son of a bitch that took down our President.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|H-here. You can have the damn necklace. Just leave me alone!
neutral|All right, you have a point. They were good men and deserved better.
anger|They killed her!
neutral|They've been through some rough times, but they can hold their own. I wouldn't mind taking the boys and signing up with them, if it weren't for Lem.
anger|Then when I die, you can pass control of the Great Khans on to Regis. For now you are my heir, and will be accorded the honor of that position.
joy|I take care of my debts. How can I repay you, friend?
anger|We're just muscle. Alexander's the man to talk to.
neutral|But they haven't left me any choice. It's this or a lifetime of scavenging and watching my friends die in losing battles. I guess it's settled, then.
neutral|Now go, and teach what you've learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
neutral|Nor is he allowed to sample the world-class cuisine of the Gourmand, New Vegas' only 5-star restaurant.
joy|That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
neutral|The crowd loves your bravery.
neutral|Also in the headlines...
joy|Nice work at the Tops, buddy.
sadness|I want you to collect NCR dogtags from our fallen troopers. That way I can keep track of who's gone and how to reallocate our supplies.
anger|Eat hot lead, you commie bastard!
sadness|I take it my men were dead. It's a high price to pay, but these supplies will save a few lives here.
anger|Got time to save us too, or are you running errands for your NCR masters?
fear|Time to am-scray!
anger|I don't want to get out, do you hear me! I just... no, no, no!
neutral|So, what else did you want?
neutral|All right. Your call.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
neutral|Our main camp is up in Red Rock Canyon, but we don't allow just anyone to come on in.
joy|You're a bastard after my own heart. Here, this should do it.
neutral|Okay, come on back when you do.
joy|I heard that Caesar was killed by his own Lieutenants. I wonder if their infighting will give us a break for a while.
anger|What the hell?!
neutral|Yep. It's your typical city layout. Rich people in a gated community surrounded by extreme poverty.
disgust|Have him fill you in on the details. He's in the back of the building. You'll know him when you see him.
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
anger|No!
disgust|What!? I don't get paid near enough to what my talent deserves!? A 150 caps is my final offer.
joy|Eh, fair enough. It's not like anyone's ever wanted to buy them before. 250 caps it is.
surprise|Aha!
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
joy|Okay, you try that and let me know. How she looks, what she's wearing, she's safe, anything - I'll pay you, you hear?
joy|Thank you, every tag you bring me is one more soldier at peace.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
anger|Damn!
neutral|Hey, welcome to Red Rock Canyon! Since you've done so much for the Great Khans, Papa Khan told me to let you know you can buy weapons at our Armory.
neutral|A big congratulations to a young band of soldiers who shattered NCR records on a combat readiness evaluation at Camp Golf. Go get 'em, guys!
neutral|Can do.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
anger|I thought you'd be made of stronger stuff, merc. Don't prove me wrong or I'll have to find someone else with the guts to do what's right.
joy|A break's better than a shot - less chance of lead poisoning. Hey, if you know any gigs hiring, I'll work cheap. Real cheap. I'll take peanuts!
fear|Withered... broken! Not speak any more.
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
neutral|Excellent. You've done very well indeed. These tribals will make useful machete fodder.
neutral|Hmm. Well, I suppose we could always use another junior archivist in the library. All right, tell him we'll accept him as a probationary initiate.
anger|Uh, hate to criticize boss, but I'm not actually immortal. Just old.
neutral|It means "decimation," but in ancient Rome the word had a very specific meaning - a punishment for cowardice.
anger|I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
neutral|Is there a place to grab food by the monorail?
fear|Bleeding out pretty bad here!
fear|Aaaaahhhhh - Help!
joy|What he doesn't know is that the only thing the console controls is the plant's intercom system.
anger|Well, hurry it up. We don't have much time.
neutral|The president of the NCR has been killed at Hoover Dam. President Kimball was slated to give a rallying speech to troops stationed there.
joy|Want to see the best of New Vegas? Our sewers got it - The Thorn!
neutral|You've got yourself a deal.
joy|Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
sadness|Not good. We still haven't gotten any support from the rest of the NCR and the Legion is kicking our ass right now.
neutral|Our preliminary research shows that the Omertas used to do some business in Freeside, mostly buying weapons. Any other questions?
neutral|You bear the Mark of Caesar. That makes you special.
joy|Right on, right on. You're a pretty hip kitten.
surprise|What? Are you serious? I am an artist! I need inspiration, not therapy.
neutral|The only thing that'd get his attention is technology.
anger|Got 'em spotted.
joy|Now, I've had my share of ups and downs along the way, but I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.
joy|Okay, we've got our dummy grenades and the course is live. We're all set.
anger|These beasts are slaves to their instincts and hunger for blood. That's good enough an answer for everyone, and it'll do for you too.
anger|Vale.
joy|That's a true friend of this wonderful place! Lady Luck shines on you.
joy|I've heard of you. I'm glad you're here to help us out. This is a delicate matter and we need all the help we can get from people we can trust.
anger|So, let's see it, stranger. Do you know yourself?
sadness|That's too bad, but at least you didn't start hacking and slashing with a knife. I don't think Major Polatli could handle two doctors like that.
neutral|Ha! How do you like that you sons of bitches?!
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
anger|We'll get 'em.
disgust|Damn shame. Anything else I can do for you?
anger|Can't grow crops if they don't give us the water.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
sadness|I don't know what to say. Words don't begin. Here, take the key to the Presidential - the best suite in the house. Stay as long as you like.
joy|More fights, we want more.
neutral|You still okay bringing me along?
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
anger|You're dead!
neutral|Believe me, I would love orders to take Cottonwood Cove apart and kick the Legion back across the river.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|You didn't show any reaction to it, so I figured you didn't know what you'd gotten your hands on.
surprise|Aha!
neutral|Okay.
neutral|VStoryEventKimballAssassination set to 4.
neutral|There's nothing to think about. You have a job to do, so do it.
neutral|I've been keeping quiet and hoping they don't realize one of their buddies is missing. We need to get out of here before they come back.
joy|With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
surprise|What? Have you seen him? Have you talked to him?
anger|
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
neutral|I spent the next few decades in a veritable coma. But I survived, obviously - and eventually thrived.
neutral|The Brotherhood's strategy for survival worked back when we had a larger force, and no organized enemies.
joy|Well, things have been improving lately. More supplies, more troops. We might actually be able to turn things around.
anger|What the hell do you want?
anger|You want to convince Papa not to ally with Caesar, right? Trust me, you'll get nowhere just talking to him about it.
anger|They killed her!
anger|Cut it out, will you?
sadness|Rest in peace, Brother.
sadness|Please don't take this the wrong way.
joy|It's easy. Just bring back any NCR dogtags you find and I'll try to make it worth your while.
fear|He was taking us into the mine up ahead, but I managed to get away. I need help to get them out.
joy|Looks like they're planning to strike some of the southern caravans. I'll notify the rangers and patrols in that area immediately.
fear|Hey... I'm just worked up, okay. You're tough, right? You won't care about my stupid rambling then?
joy|Nothing to worry about. If you had hired one of those other hacks, you'd be up to your ass in lowlife right about now.
fear|I'm still not so sure about that.
neutral|It's always in the last place you look. I wonder why that is.
joy|It's your paradise on this desolate earth, hon. Your troubles are gone, your pain forgotten, and your dreams come true.
anger|Damn!
joy|Lady Luck smiled on our President.
anger|What do you need?
joy|You just made my day! Opening fire!
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
neutral|I got a pressure in me like Hoover Dam.
neutral|Turned out some of them "Night Kids"  - whatever you call those sneaky Super Mutant types - got in and busted him out.
neutral|Echo has been reporting heavy Legion activity down on their end, but that's about it.
joy|Well, it was my idea - well, me and the rest of the Rad Pack boys. We took it to Benny, and he thought it was a good idea.
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
joy|You want to gamble with class? Hit the Ultra-Luxe, if you don't mind being serviced by masked creeps.
neutral|Zzzz....
anger|Is there something you need?
neutral|I need to get the caravans moving again, that means clearing a path north. There's too much crawling the asphalt up the road to allow it.
sadness|I don't have that many supplies left, so I can't offer my services freely, but I can help you.
neutral|It has a stark beauty, doesn't it? I'm glad you can appreciate it.
anger|I know you have a penchant for getting into trouble, but I'd recommend against that here. The Securitrons on the Strip aren't to be trifled with.
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
neutral|Yeah, whatever.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
anger|That's not funny.
fear|Fight!
anger|They killed him!
anger|Damn!
anger|Flank 'em!
anger|Greetings in the name of Caesar.
anger|Fuck that Fiend bastard. Wish I would've seen him die.
anger|Don't talk to me!
anger|Stay out of trouble, we have enough problems here as it is.
anger|Go East! they say. Scrap lying in the sun for you to grab. Yeah, right.
neutral|Keep your heads down and move up to the next location.
fear|You killed him! What have we done to you?
joy|That Caesar bastard had it coming.
anger|Your behavior has become an unwelcome X-factor, and I would kindly ask you to consider altering it.
joy|May I help you?
joy|Cooke left the vault, good thing too he was going to get us all killed.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
fear|What is that thing? I've never seen a blue mutant.
neutral|A few Great Khans are on the loose after an aborted standoff left at least two NCR hostages dead. The NCR is offering a reward for their capture.
joy|I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
anger|You are not my Centurion! You aren't even Legion! I do not "carry on" at your command.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
neutral|Careful out there.
joy|NCR should head back to their lands, I'm sure *their* people miss them.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
neutral|I've also locked down access to critical locations such as the landing platform on the visitor center.
anger|Damn it!
joy|Well, that's all she wrote.
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
anger|It's not the easiest job in the world - soldiers without a mission get bored very easily.
joy|Hey, I heard about you. What can I do for you, friend?
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
anger|I'd rather kill you than talk to you.
anger|What the hell?!
neutral|So fucked up I can't feel my legs.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
joy|Ha ha ha! Okay, okay... stop or I'll choke, I swear. Listen, kid - I'll cut you some slack because nothing else in this town will, you hear?
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
anger|What do you need?
fear|Get back!
anger|Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
neutral|All right. Sit still and let me work.
sadness|Maybe. Maybe I just never felt like I belonged back home.
anger|Just imagine the look on Baldie's face when those Securitrons come pouring out on judgment day! I'd pay to have that bronzed!
joy|He just showed up here one day. Couldn't really talk, but he remembered me all right.
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
anger|Come on!
surprise|What on earth is *that* creature?
anger|Come on!
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
surprise|We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
anger|You dirty coward!
neutral|No more negotiating, and definitely no more waiting. This is your last chance before we take it by force.
neutral|See you.
anger|Hey, that's mine!
neutral|I know not why Caesar would wish to speak with such a physically inferior whelp, but I will allow this one exception.
fear|The ground in Forlorn Hope was soaked red, from the blood of our own people!
joy|New guy, eh? The more the merrier around here!
neutral|The Optics Enhancer, as the name suggests, gets attached directly to your optic nerve. The price is 4,000 caps.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
anger|You can jump out the window, for all I care, lady.
anger|Nah, just spruce it up with a crucifixion here and there. Come closer so I can step on you.
neutral|The Platinum Chip was printed in Sunnyvale, California on October 22nd, 2077 - the day before the Great War.
joy|You'll get a piece of the action, and a sweet one. But the Chip sticks with me.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
neutral|Thanks, that'll help.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
joy|I've always wanted to play a prank on him, but there's no way I could ever pull that off without getting in trouble from Captain Pappas.
anger|Corporal White is currently solving the mystery of the Great Water Shortage. Tried to convince me he had proof, even. I didn't buy any of it.
disgust|The NCR has all of the problems of the ancient Roman Republic - extreme bureaucracy, corruption, extensive senatorial infighting.
anger|Ave Caesar!
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
anger|Stay out of my way and I'll stay out of yours, got it?
neutral|We can go right over here, baby.
anger|I didn't even feel that one!
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
joy|I heard you won Private Sexton's little contest. Congratulations. It's nice to have morale up around here.
anger|Sorry, that just ain't gonna happen.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
neutral|Said he'd always wanted to sleep with the Lakelurks.
anger|Keep your hands to yourself!
fear|Caesar's death is good news for the NCR. For everyone, most likely.
sadness|I hope I didn't hurt your feelings with all that shooting and flaming. I'm afraid it's just the way I was programmed.
surprise|The big showdown between the NCR and the Legion is coming soon, believe you me.
neutral|Suit yourself, it's not my fault if they find your body dumped in Freeside.
neutral|Is there a place to grab food by the monorail?
surprise|I hear Mr. House cashed out. Ain't much to miss.
neutral|With their commander gone, the NCR will pull out of this region, allowing our conquest to continue westward unopposed for a time.
anger|What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
neutral|Here's your NCR money. Will there be anything else?
joy|Well, his Centurion wanted him crucified for disobedience. So I made him a Frumentari.
neutral|Here's your chip. Is there anything else I can help you with?
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
neutral|What's your reputation with Caesar's Legion?
neutral|What's it look like, man? I'm fucking king of the NCR. Caesar's Legion has Caesar, the NCR's got Fantastic. It's Fantastic's NCR now.
neutral|What? Wonderful news!
joy|Confident, I like that.
anger|Well it is. Not everybody appreciates it like they oughtta.
anger|Damn it! The timing couldn't be any worse. I tried to warn those buffoons, but they insisted on this little show.
anger|Hey, that's not yours!
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
anger|The Legion will definitely try something, but we don't have any solid leads yet.
anger|Come on. I can't listen to this anymore.
anger|You had your chance.
anger|That's against regulations!
anger|Run faster or I will throw you off the side.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
neutral|Take it on home.
anger|Grrrraah!
surprise|Head voices say they knew flower girl's father.
neutral|If you ever come out to Red Rock Canyon, I'll put in a good word for you.
sadness|I'm sorry it had to end this way.
neutral|If you want me to transplant this brain into Rex, he'll become more durable.
neutral|We need to stop and pee soon.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
anger|The direct approach, hey? Fair enough.
anger|If McCarran would send us some more men, we could do more than watch.
joy|Stupid weak things never last long.
neutral|Strange rumors from across the river indicate a secret underground robot army has been destroyed before anyone was able to use it.
joy|It was a matter of time before someone got to Mr. House.
disgust|Filthy lowlife scum!
joy|I kinda like being a farmer.
joy|We owe you so much for saving our President.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
surprise|No! That's not what I meant! I-
disgust|Better not try that again.
surprise|The robots here look different than others I've seen.
fear|Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
joy|Hey-o!
neutral|The stealth field has been modulated to use less power and thus last longer, but for some reason it has pronounced negative effects on the user.
neutral|Oh. Um... okay.
neutral|Well, ain't like I've got places to be.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
joy|You're a model citizen, thank you.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
sadness|Head voices say silver chair flies east.
fear|Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.
anger|I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
surprise|Where'd he go?
neutral|She stuck out, pretty much everywhere we went. Like she was from a different time. A better time. I never met anyone like her.
joy|Sweet little caper, getting your weapons back. But let cooler heads prevail, hey? No need for violence.
sadness|Well, I don't know anything else. Sorry.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
anger|They want me, they'll have to catch me.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|We're independent folks here. Merchants, gamblers, NCR whores, all of them trade with us and we offer protection against critters and the Fiends.
joy|Good riddance, Caesar! We can finally enjoy some R&R without worrying about a Legion attack at McCarran.
joy|Another satisfied customer.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
anger|We'll get 'em.
surprise|Hey, who says I can't fix that? You bring me those boom-suits too, okay?
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
anger|What the hell?!
anger|Get the hell away! We're done talking.
surprise|Hmm... an intriguing proposition.
joy|Excellent, excellent! Please be patient, the tour will begin in just a moment.
sadness|Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
surprise|Holy shit!
neutral|We've got a busy day ahead of us.
neutral|Guess somebody wasn't very good at keeping secrets, either.
surprise|Found you!
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
surprise|In no mood for hunting.
anger|It's payback time, that's what! They've got no right to screw me over, and I'm tired of it!
anger|I... really don't see the connection. Look, I'm a soldier, not a scientist. I just do my job.
neutral|I'm just the guy who tells you to do the stuff you do before you do it.
joy|I've still got guns and ammo, if you need them.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
neutral|How can I help them when they won't accept it?
sadness|I hear they're already assembling a team to investigate the President's assassination. Going to be one hell of a report.
joy|They're called bodyguards, and every one of them is packing. Me, too - so baby makes five.
anger|What makes you think I give a damn about you?
disgust|Better not try that again.
joy|I can't wait to see the Strip. I hear it's so beautiful!
fear|What do you want with me?
joy|You know it, baby!
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
fear|I'm not so sure about that. I don't know how the NCR feels about ghouls.
anger|Please, I've seen kids who were better liars than you. Tell the truth now - what are you after?
fear|I'm not allowed to talk to you. Bye.
surprise|Huh?
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
anger|False alarm. Stand down, people.
neutral|Yeah. They say he built the Strip. Of course, they say a lot of things. No one's actually met him.
anger|This operation has cost me plenty. I ain't about to get shaken down by some Janey-come-lately.
neutral|<whuff!>
joy|To think I deemed that flintbox my lucky charm. Oh, the irony...
neutral|As much as I like to handle matters personally, I can't be everywhere at once.
joy|At this rate, one Securitron is going to be enough to defend the whole Strip.
neutral|Me? I think it's a hoax. Probably a group of people who want to avoid attention, or some made-up persona of a self-aware computer.
disgust|Those rockets over at REPCONN were the NCR's doing. Trying to keep us scared so they can stick around to "protect" us.
neutral|Tell everyone you meet of what you saw here. The Legion can handle the rest.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
joy|We trust you, so you're free to have your weapons. Just don't do anything too crazy and we'll back you up.
anger|Nobody threatens me and walks away alive!
neutral|All right. We won't stay for long.
surprise|Aha!
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
surprise|You must be the one Doc Mitchell was patching up. The way I heard it, I didn't think you'd be walking out of that office.
neutral|Yes, but the leadership and I didn't see eye to eye, so I left. It was the right decision, since the Enclave's oil rig was destroyed not long after.
neutral|They were nomads, capable fighters, but their specialty was betrayal. They'd invite travelers into their yurts, drug them, murder or enslave them.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
surprise|We've heard about you from the officers at our embassy.
neutral|The rest of the dam is fully under our control. A few pitiful holdouts remain, but their time is short. The general was the last source of concern.
surprise|Hey!
surprise|I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
anger|I can't believe this shit. You again?
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
joy|Well. Welcome to you. You look tired from the road. Why don't you relax a spell, let this fine town take care of you?
neutral|You got a point. There's still some things I can do before all this is over.
anger|Look, I don't need your shit. Either get out of the way or things are gonna get rough.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
anger|Cachino doesn't give a shit about rules, only cares to feed his perversions. He lusted for me, he's done things to me.
neutral|We can go right over here, baby.
joy|We're finally getting all the water we're supposed to. It's about time.
neutral|Whoa... you were serious. Okay, yeah, this might just work. Thanks.
fear|What the fuck are you doing here?
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
neutral|Pustulah -- what? Is that contagious? That doesn't sound good at all!
neutral|Caesar's Legion attacked us near Searchlight. The rangers say they probably took my family to Cottonwood Cove.
disgust|Name's Hadrian. Bet you never saw a ghoul in a suit before, huh? Course, you don't exactly strike me as the worldly type.
surprise|Holy fuck. Never seen a mutant like that before.
neutral|You can find it in the basement of the burned-out old building at the mouth of the canyon.
neutral|That's it, keep moving.
sadness|Sorry I don't know much more than that.
neutral|No, no. We only protect people from themselves, and only in the sense that we don't let them have the really good Pre-War toys.
surprise|Everyone's talking about Hoover Dam nowadays. I wish the battle would just happen already. The suspense is killing me.
anger|We found you!
surprise|Shit. Have you any damn idea what lives in these caves!? We need to get out of...
neutral|No! Not like this!
disgust|Murderer!
joy|Yeah, I do. Thanks. I think we might survive this now.
joy|I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
neutral|Okay.
anger|Don't get me started, stranger. We don't take kindly to either of them. We've fought hard for our home, and we're here to stay.
fear|This alliance with Caesar, for one thing - I have my doubts about it.
joy|The Lucky 38, all lit up in the distance? It's an inviting target.
anger|You got no right asking me that. Drop it.
surprise|Hey!
neutral|What's going on off the Strip?
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
anger|If the NCR wasn't spread so thin, maybe we could actually get some supplies and reinforcements around here.
neutral|I'm glad to hear it.
surprise|Good call! I mean, if that's what you really want, boss.
anger|Come on, people, give 'em hell!
neutral|One of these days I'm hoping we can trade with the rest of the wasteland. No more fighting, just... get along.
joy|I know I didn't, because I hadn't gotten to that line of my speech yet. What remarkable timing you have.
neutral|The secret ingredient? Tender loving care, according to the chef.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
joy|Heard there was a firefight in one of the big casinos. Maybe they'll need to buy more ammo now.
fear|I don't want to die!
neutral|VStoryEventSurvivedTrap set to 1.
fear|We were on patrol near the Dam when a Legion raiding party jumped us. Didn't even have to time to radio it in.
neutral|Given their history of extreme isolationism, it's tempting to leave them be. But those howitzers of theirs...
neutral|You ever want to look me up again, I'll be in my bunker in Hidden Valley. That's the luxury bunker.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
anger|The money, yes! It's mine, and nobody can stop me from getting it!
surprise|As you wish.
joy|Here's the key. I'll be by in a few... just as soon as my legs stop shaking.
joy|That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
joy|Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
neutral|I'll turn myself in. Thank you for understanding.
joy|You'll get a sweet, juicy cut of that action. But until that day comes, I'll keep you on retainer, and pay bonuses for "special missions."
sadness|If someone can blow up the Monorail, I guess we're not safe even in the Strip.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|Well now, what's all this.
disgust|They are passable foes. Like their citizens, they prefer their war from a distance, and at that, they excel.
neutral|What do you want to do with Rex?
joy|You were, really? Okay. For a moment I thought you were going to tighten my screws - like everyone else around here.
anger|Going in guns blazing with all the NCR Troopers and Rangers stationed at the dam will just get you killed.
neutral|We ain't ordinary, are we? See, I pack good brass up with slow-burning powder, then cap it with a heavy semiwadcutter bullet.
neutral|What's your reputation in Freeside?
fear|Get back!
surprise|Right on, let's have it!
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
sadness|You're right, there's no place for me here. Just... just tell them I'm sorry, and that they won't have to worry about me, ever again.
anger|You want a reason, how about four?
surprise|Thank you for the offer but I think I really can't go to see... wait a minute. I know! I don't have to necessarily be there to see it.
anger|This sucks.
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
fear|A Legion patrol caught me trying to cross the river. When they found the, umm, package I was carrying, they strung me up there.
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
joy|Her hair stands tall, like the spiky bits on a Deathclaw.
joy|Here you go, this'll give you some zing.
fear|Leave me alone!
disgust|It's good to have the Khans on our side, but I hope they keep them out of the Strip. Those savages smell like Bighorner's ass.
neutral|That is, unless we get to them first. I want you to visit them in their canyons to the far west and make sure they're in no shape to join the Legion.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
joy|Another satisfied customer.
neutral|The crowd consists of troopers and a few select civilians who were lucky enough to bribe their way in. They shouldn't cause much trouble for you.
neutral|Here, Rey! Mama's got something for you.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
surprise|The Chief? But, he's a legend! I guess if he's got a plan behind it all, who am I to question it? I won't say a word about it to anyone else.
neutral|Thanks for letting me know. Glad I didn't do any business with them.
joy|I wish there was some other way we could have worked this out.
surprise|Found you!
neutral|You want something from me, you're gonna have to earn it. And it just so happens that I've got a few things I need taken care of. So what do you say?
neutral|What, we leaving *already?*
sadness|I heard the Legion veteran troops are coming to the front lines. That's the last thing we need right now.
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
neutral|A bunch of shut-ins who scorn outsiders and hold technology over them. Gee, where have I heard that one before?
neutral|If I was the assassin, I'd be up on that ridge. Or if I didn't care about escaping, maybe that near tower, or the landing pad behind us.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
fear|Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
neutral|The Chip contained vital software upgrades, but not just for my Securitrons. Every aspect of the missile defense grid would have been upgraded, too.
anger|Get lost!
sadness|I don't know... the Khans don't really get me, but at least they're family, you know?
sadness|Okay - you're right. I hate going outside. It's almost impossible for me to step out of here. Still, I love my vault. It's my pad!
neutral|All right, then. Be patient since this will take awhile.
joy|I've been married for 17 years. Where did I go wrong?
anger|They killed him!
neutral|Didn't look comfortable. He kept reaching up like he was gonna itch it, but he always stopped himself.
neutral|Jesus. You're a real goddamn psycho.
anger|Oh, so I've redeemed the human race, is that it? What a crock! The human race can't stand me!
joy|Going to place me a good bet at The Thorn.
anger|This sucks.
surprise|Aha!
neutral|That happens, there's a good chance other Nightkin will follow. It'll make it hard to get a cure to them.
neutral|With the Khans, any of them can be dangerous. There's a lot you can't see through a scope.
neutral|The others here don't understand our kind, but you can count of me, friend.
neutral|Head north toward Novac. Look for a big dinosaur, can't miss it.
neutral|Really?  Huh, never thought of that.  The Crimson Caravan isn't really in the drug business.
neutral|Take care.
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
neutral|But I'll tell you who needs some babysitting. Those damn kids keep running around in here.
surprise|Head voices hear of new metal men. But not metal men. Different metal men. Make head hurt.
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
neutral|I think my tourniquet will work for now, but I still can't walk like this.
neutral|All right, we're done here. Go ahead and power the Stealth Boy down, Lily.
anger|I tell you, something stinks about this Monorail attack!
sadness|Stay for a while, hon. Jump in bed and let me do the rest.
surprise|Can you imagine how much electricity it takes to keep this Vault running?
neutral|The legate then ordered a tenth of his own force be killed by the other nine tenths. And you thought your boss was a pain.
surprise|Aha!
fear|Looks like Mr. House run out of luck, huh?
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
joy|Without leadership, the Fiends are as good as dead!
neutral|What's on your mind?
joy|A friend of mine at the Dam says President Kimball might visit the troops out there. Imagine shaking the president's hand!
neutral|Here's your chip. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
joy|Good. Now Kimball is scheduled to give his speech tomorrow. We'll rest here tonight and talk over the plan first thing in the morning.
disgust|I just don't trust the words of Caesar's ambassador that much. He's promising a lot, and I don't see the advantage for him. It makes me suspicious.
neutral|Then it's a good thing this weapon has fallen into the right hands.
neutral|And gather your clothes and belongings.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
neutral|I do have some information that you might find useful, if you're interested.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|You are a match to my elite, but don't congratulate yourself so profusely just yet. Still, your valor deserves recognition and I shall honor it.
joy|Back for more?
anger|I never trusted those Omerta punks, even if I like their girls.
neutral|Freeside: Shunned.
joy|< sniff >
neutral|Roger that. I'll have snipers move to position.
anger|The NCR beat them at the dam three years ago, but that didn't stop them. They've spent the meanwhile gathering strength.
neutral|If your pleasure is to see them bleed at your will, I'll oblige only after my costs are covered, stranger.
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
anger|Come on!
neutral|Howdy do, folks. I'm Sheriff Meyers. Be good, or I'll shoot you dead.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
anger|We'll get 'em.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
fear|You're not going to raze us to the ground, like you did to Forlorn Hope, right?
neutral|What do you want to know?
neutral|Are you going to keep giving him opportunities to kill you? It's becoming a hobby of his.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
joy|Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
neutral|White was talking to me about computer stuff and water delivery schedules through the pipes, but I'm just a farmer. Tech stuff is beyond me.
anger|
anger|I have no illusions that he'll ever stop his plundering. So I'm just going to make him suffer, that's what I'm going to do.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
anger|Look out!
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
disgust|Their men take comfort in - and rely on - killing at a distance. They will not have the luxury of such comforts this time.
anger|Had enough?
joy|I've heard of you, glad to have you on our side.
joy|I hope you're doing well, friend!
neutral|All right... keep walking.
surprise|Damn, be careful with those things!
joy|Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
fear|Please - I'll be in trouble if the Legionaries see you speaking to me.
neutral|We couldn't have known. We fought for what we believed in.
neutral|I know she's been frequenting the square in North Vegas, probably hanging out with street scum. I want to know more about her new "friends."
surprise|Horns unleashed. Many will feel their sting.
joy|More reinforcements are in from Primm. Damn glad to have those guys here.
anger|Damn!
neutral|Great Khan, looks like. Guess he fought at Bitter Springs. Or saw it happen.
anger|Listen, we own these lands, and I'll be damned if the NCR, those Legion bastards, or anyone else tries to walk all over us.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
neutral|Thanks, that'll help.
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
neutral|Of course, dearie.
surprise|If you had asked me a month ago, I'd have said we'd never willingly work with the NCR. But look at us now.
anger|No! You slimy bastard!
disgust|Your decisiveness is truly a wonder to behold, boss.
joy|This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
joy|We're just going to be a moment. We should both take a look first.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
surprise|Whoa!
anger|Sorry, I'm not giving it to you.
neutral|Fine, this isn't worth the trouble to fight over.
surprise|I'm not touching that one with a ten-foot pole.
joy|Oh. Well, go ahead and keep the stuff I gave you, anyway. It'll be more useful to you than me.
joy|What's on your mind?
joy|Taking down a Giant Radscorpion, by yourself, has made you popular down here.
joy|You did? Hot damn! I been looking for one of those for years!
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
neutral|You think you're better than me? You're just like those goody-goody Followers of the Apocalypse.
disgust|Filthy lowlife scum!
neutral|Very well. Will there be anything else?
anger|Do you think us inferior men, willing to sell their soul for scraps! Enough of this.
disgust|What do you want?
neutral|I couldn't get one of their most reasonable members to accept a rational argument. I don't see them coming out in droves to support my coup.
neutral|It wouldn't matter. The Elder has final say.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
neutral|All right, girls, show's over.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
anger|Fuck that Fiend bastard. Wish I would've seen him die.
surprise|Hey!
disgust|Better not try that again.
anger|Flank 'em!
anger|You dirty coward!
surprise|Did you do that on purpose?
surprise|Hey!
disgust|Shit, man, it was this or the Fiends, and Fiends don't last too long in the NCR.
neutral|But I guess he spent all his money on the rangefinder, because he said it had to be somewhere free to stay.
neutral|Understandable. Let me know when you've decided.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
surprise|My god!
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
anger|I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
neutral|This is your size.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
anger|She's guarding it, I know she is!
disgust|Sure, boss. I'd be happy to prolong my captivity and psychological abuse to tighten some lug nuts for you.
joy|Maybe. But, thanks for saying it, anyway.
neutral|Maybe they don't wanna talk to you. Maybe they ain't here anymore. Maybe you ask too many questions, stranger.
neutral|As for the White Glove Society, I afraid I'm contractually obligated not to reveal their original name.
anger|What the hell?!
neutral|Man, I just don't know how an idiot like that gets put in charge of anything.
surprise|Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
anger|Come out and face your death!
joy|You might have to manually remove the encryption from his data network, but hopefully you won't have too much trouble. Good luck!
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
neutral|He was an inmate like the rest of us. He was useful during the jailbreak, but now...
neutral|What about him? He has every reason to go to the Fort, so that's where you'll find him.
disgust|Uh... hmm... well, no accounting for taste I guess. Anyway...
anger|You gotta piss someone off to pull guard duty out here.
disgust|I've heard of you, what do you want?
neutral|I can't believe you actually got one. Give me a bit to get the recipe set up, then talk to me again.
joy|You march all the way out to Red Rock Canyon, enter my home as bold as you please, and you have no idea who I am? You've got guts, I'll give you that.
anger|One of those beasts cut my friend in half! How the hell did they escape from Red Lucy?
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
joy|His first step is to beat the failed commander to death in front of his assembled troops. Then he orders the ritual of decimatio.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
surprise|Word is the Khans signed a treaty with the NCR. Never saw that coming.
neutral|VStoryEventHanlon set to 2.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
anger|I have a personal message for you from Uncle Sam!
anger|What on earth could push you to destroy Forlorn Hope?
surprise|Huh?
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
sadness|Oh well. I wish you hadn't left so soon. I was having such a good time with you.
surprise|Baby, every boss has a line to explain why he's special, why everyone gotta do what he says. Just figuring that out?
neutral|And finally, I need someone to "acquire" the Gun Runner's manufacturing specifications. This job needs to be quiet - no alarms, no deaths.
neutral|You might - one fellow I knew was able to slip a pistol past the guards. You? I'm guessing you could get a machine gun by them.
joy|Lady Luck's on your side. I hope some of that rubs off on me, Caesar killer!
anger|I'm getting real tired of talking.
joy|I can't imagine this place will ever disappear.
neutral|Fire Geckos are among The Wasteland's most dangerous creatures. Near the Ireteba Peaks lies a nest where you may find their eggs.
neutral|Some folks steer clear of him, for sure, but he don't seem to mind.
sadness|Might as well do the job right.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
anger|Time to die!
surprise|Was there something else?
neutral|I was blowing up supply caravans along the 15 freeway. The NCR got wise to my ambush spots, picked me up and threw me in a cage.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
neutral|If I had a doctor's bag, I could probaly fix it up myself.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
neutral|Some of the Super Mutants have looked around as well, but they've come back empty-handed. Perhaps a pair of fresh eyes will have better luck.
neutral|There's more to it, but we don't have the time. By which I mean you don't.
anger|Hey look, I just wanted to forget about all this stuff happening around here for a little while, that's all!
fear|I'm getting out of here!
anger|They killed her!
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|Even Presidents die, huh? Good.
neutral|Check your weapons and move up!
joy|And a quick shot... all done.
neutral|I should've died here a long time ago. When I spotted the legionaries today I thought I understood. Things were finally going to even out.
sadness|You're probably right. Here, take it.
joy|Then, when he ain't looking, you knock him out of the running and find a way to take control of those Securitrons of his.
joy|When you're ready to saddle up, come find me down on the casino floor and we'll plan the next step of this caper.
neutral|Talk to Jack, he'd be happy to sell you some top-quality chems. He'll even give you a discount.
joy|Stories of how you saved President Kimball are the talk of the Strip, friend!
joy|That last turn we took is an 18 karat memory, baby. It's all that's been keeping me warm at night, stuck where I am.
neutral|Heh heh heh heh ooo, heh heh heh.
disgust|How disgusting. You can see that strange mechanical mongrel's brain.
neutral|I suppose you could talk to Ghost, up on top of the barracks - uh, Ranger Ghost. Something about trouble in Nipton, maybe.
neutral|I'd rather not, but fair enough. We'll do it.
joy|Thanks for taking care of getting me out of here. I owe you big time.
neutral|If you want. It's not really my thing. What do you want to know?
neutral|Grrr! Lily smash! Haha.
neutral|VStoryEventMonorailDestroyed set to 2.
neutral|Do me a favor and stay dead this time, hey? Good night all! It's been a gas...
joy|I'll send word to Major Polatli about your work here. Once again, you have my sincerest thanks.
neutral|They'll never accept my using an army of robots to defend New Vegas. While it's a fight I can win, I'd rather sidestep it altogether.
surprise|Huh?
neutral|Dark in here. If you want to use a scope, I can spot for you. Keep you on target.
surprise|Aha!
anger|We provided medical aid to the wounded - all the wounded - and permitted the Khans to resettle at Red Rock Canyon.
fear|And don't worry about the rest of the Chairmen - I'll keep them from getting involved. You'll still have to watch out for Benny's guards, though.
surprise|Killing Fire Geckos at The Thorn is no joke, you're quite the fighter!
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
disgust|Christ. They put the graveyard here.
neutral|See you around.
neutral|Leaving? Into exile? Good. Save us the trouble.
anger|You're an enemy of the Followers, as far as I'm concerned. I don't care how you've helped us.
neutral|Gomorrah's receptionist happens to be one. For years she passed on whispers of what was taking place at the casino, in exchange for payment.
neutral|I'll expect to see some tangible progress before long, then.
joy|Howdy mister.
surprise|What on earth is *that* creature?
joy|Almost done here. What do you say you have a look at this? Tell me what you see.
anger|Nothing's going on, so just mind your own business.
anger|No!
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
joy|I can't believe the NCR actually showed up. We sure showed them, though. Right?
neutral|You give Lupa a worthy death in the arena, and her brain is yours. Don't let your guard down just because she's old, though.
fear|I don't want any trouble, okay?
neutral|Ah, the Codex. If it's in there, we have to abide it, if it's not, it's not important.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
neutral|Don't be a stranger.
joy|Consider it "on the house," honey.
sadness|Then we will accept that fate with honor.
joy|I know I'm not young and pretty any more, but I appreciate the thought all the same. Here, take the parts, you flatterer.
neutral|I think it is safe to move up.
surprise|Glad that fucker House is gone.
neutral|Make no mistake, there's a battle coming, and I intend to make sure there are no loose ends when the time comes.
joy|House is an all-right kind of guy. Sure, he keeps a pretty tight grip on the reins, but Vegas is a wild horse, and you can't just give her her head.
neutral|Asked to comment, Big Sal said, quote, the fuck you looking at? You wearing a wire? Are you? I'll break your fucking kneecaps. Hey. Get back here.
neutral|I knew it. I suspected that Chief Hanlon was behind all this, but since he's dead, there's no way we'll ever know.
anger|You've got a lot of nerve coming into our camp.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
joy|I hope you're doing well, friend!
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
joy|And put this on, too, so the locals don't pick on you for lacking modesty. Was my wife's.
joy|Lady Luck smiled on our President.
joy|Lem was going to turn us all in to the NCR, I'm glad he's dead.
neutral|I am in the beginning stages of planning out an assault on The Fort. I've made calls to our allies, and they are on their way to our position.
surprise|Huh?
joy|If you're looking to buy or sell, you've come to the right man. The Crimson Caravan Company has the widest selection in the wasteland.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
anger|Let's dance!
surprise|Glad that fucker House is gone.
joy|Thanks.
anger|We make it a point to scour Pre-War bottling plants and recover or disable the bottle cap presses. It seems we missed one.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
joy|The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
neutral|Shh. You feel that? That's the winds of change, baby, and Fantastic's riding them with his magic angel wings.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
neutral|Those are our stories this hour. This is Mr. New Vegas signing off. Just kidding. I'm not going anywhere. My love for you is too strong.
joy|Dr. Richards said you did a good job in there. That's mighty high praise coming from him.
surprise|Aha!
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
neutral|Let's see... good guard dog tendencies. If I transplant this brain into Rex, he'll be a bit more ferocious in his attacks.
joy|I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
joy|Well, that's all she wrote.
neutral|It's not very efficient, though, but hopefully we'll be able to start running larger caravans once things get civilized.
surprise|Holy shit!
sadness|I don't like it, but orders are orders.
neutral|No, I didn't, not until now anyway. Very well, human. You've made your point, and I withdraw my... request.
disgust|The Chairmen are true blue. The Omertas are degenerates - never trust them. Or the White Gloves - just something creepy about them.
neutral|The light is a button that can interrupt detonation? We were too busy throwing ourselves to the ground to figure that out.
joy|In all these things, Vulpes is a master.
surprise|Surprised anybody'd want to tangle with you. Heck, you could go Deathclaw hunting with a switch.
neutral|I can't believe someone wanted to kill President Kimball. I'm glad he got out of here safe.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
neutral|Zone clear! Advance to the next position.
joy|NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
neutral|During his visit to Hoover Dam, an attempt on the life of NCR President Aaron Kimball was thwarted by a quick-thinking civilian.
joy|What are you doing?
anger|Can't do that, baby. The Chip, it's... special. But savor this, baby...
sadness|Sorry. I can't talk right now.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
disgust|That's a shame. Well, do what you want. Just don't expect it to matter.
neutral|Too bad, baby. You know where to find me.
joy|Your worthless hide is mine!
neutral|We have to stop limiting our focus to military technology. It won't save us.
surprise|Hey!
joy|We're gonna check out the police and fire stations. They were the buildings used the most by the NCR, so they're our best chance at good shit.
anger|What have you heard? I know people think I'm a little on the wild side, but I'm just trying to have fun, you know?
sadness|Alas, my first loyalty is to Caesar, and a soldier cannot have two masters.
anger|Them quack doctors can say what they want about all the radscorpion stings that done pierced my skull. I know what I seen.
anger|That's not a good idea.
surprise|
surprise|Chip goes when broken man calls!
sadness|My family lived not far from the great Boneyard. After Raiders killed my father, my mother sought the Followers' protection. I was two years old.
neutral|All clear!
joy|
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
joy|NCR should head back to their lands, I'm sure *their* people miss them.
neutral|While we don't know what his exact plans are, my orders are to avoid all risks. I'm sending you to take Mr. House out of the equation. Any questions?
anger|We'll get 'em.
neutral|VStoryEventBennyKilledFort to 2.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
anger|I've put up with their shit long enough. No more! I'll... I'll kill them if they get in my way!
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
joy|You can't hide from me.
joy|You'd do that? Great! I really appreciate that!
anger|Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
joy|Ha ha! - damn straight! This is about the last place in this fucking city where I can burrow without having to look over my shoulder.
joy|I'm not surprised Kimball survived. We NCR people are made of hard stuff.
anger|Cool it, smarty-pants! I don't have to take that shit from anybody, you know? Get out! Don't come back until you learn how to get along.
neutral|Now that's we're conversing, though, I can tell you what I know about those caps.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
anger|Got 'em in my sights!
joy|Back then, I, like many idealistic men before me, thought it was a great idea and was excited about making the world a better place with the NCR.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
neutral|Cursor Lucullus is waiting for you at the docks. He'll take you to Caesar.
neutral|Legatus Lanius, Monster of the East! Quite a man, if man he be.
surprise|Grenade!
anger|Don't listen to a word No-bark says. He spouts nothing but nonsense.
surprise|Great, just when you think the NCR can't possibly sink their claws deeper, the town of Primm signs up to join the Republic.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
joy|He's a member of the Followers like myself, but his particular field is pre-War history and tribal culture.
neutral|Neuron decay is rapid after death, and I doubt a live Nightstalker would cooperate with my test.
surprise|Aha!
fear|I had no idea there was such a thing as a friendly Nightkin. Look at that thing.
anger|I bet this'll hurt!
fear|Baby, this is not the place to go talking about that!
fear|Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
neutral|Are you deaf? I don't give a damn about what you want. Just get out of here.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
surprise|Found you!
sadness|The Strip ain't nothing but a monster. Chews folks up, sucks out their caps, and spits 'em back out.
joy|Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
joy|New Vegas, paradise, my ass.
neutral|Recently we've had scouts go missing in an area west of HELIOS, and I'm concerned that the Brotherhood is involved.
anger|That's not funny.
sadness|I'm coming to find you now. I'm afraid my programming does not allow me to let you get away.
neutral|Thank you for keeping my secret. I'll make sure that nothing like it ever happens again.
anger|We'll get 'em.
joy|I'm the head engineer. I make sure the turbines keep spinning and the water keeps pumping.
neutral|My great-aunt Rose ran a bed and breakfast back in California, in a town called Modoc. She's the one who created the recipe in the first place.
anger|It's about damn time.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
neutral|I'm a procurement specialist. Like I said, it's basically grocery shopping. Except sometimes the groceries are scavenged parts and arcane technology.
surprise|Once our forces are in placed and garrisoned here, we'll begin our assault.
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
anger|Add to that every Chairman in this joint is armed, and not with some hold-out peashooter like maybe you smuggled through security.
disgust|Consider yourself lucky.
anger|What on earth could push you to destroy Forlorn Hope?
fear|I'm still not allowed to talk to you.
joy|Good luck with that.
joy|Great fighting today.
surprise|Hey!
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
sadness|If someone can blow up the Monorail, I guess we're not safe even in the Strip.
joy|That was a good day for The Thorn.
neutral|Ah, that's a relief. A Brotherhood attack while we're busy with the Legion would be catastrophic.
anger|You didn't have any proof?
neutral|You're unusually bright for a Profligate. Well done.
surprise|What?! How did you pull it off?
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|Without you, we'd been in the losing end. Thank you so much for your help, friend.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
sadness|Ah, Melissa. She's a bit of a dreamer. Last time she was in camp, Karl filled her head with stories of serving the Legion as a speculatore.
anger|Come on!
surprise|Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
joy|Yeah? Hey, you're all right! Tell him I'll do it for a hundred a night! No! Fifty! No, twenty! Ten!
joy|Thanks. We haven't been paired together long, but he's a smart dog.
neutral|She... always used to say people who... murder and steal... die bad in the end. Said they...
anger|I comped you the prez so we can talk there, hey? No need to keep tugging at my sleeve.
anger|What was that for?
neutral|Sure.
neutral|I had a run-in with this group calling themselves the Brotherhood of Steel. Pretty strange bunch. Do you know anything about them?
neutral|I'm not asking you to kill them. Just talk them into leaving. Hell, pay them off if you have to.
anger|You dirty coward!
anger|If the brass back home could get their heads out of their asses long enough to send support, we could turn this all around.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
disgust|They allied with Mr. House, the self-proclaimed master of New Vegas. He supported them with the resources of New Vegas: weapons, technology, caps.
surprise|Hey!
surprise|You've been making a name for yourself around here already.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
neutral|But until recently I haven't understood where we went wrong, or how to fix it.
disgust|Perhaps you can come back and help me when you have more time.
joy|
neutral|If this is your first rodeo with the ol' horseshoes, say "How do I play?". Otherwise, say "Lucky Horseshoes" to begin.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
disgust|Come on, men - we're pulling out.
joy|I found the keys on one of the trooper corpses.
neutral|You heard me. We don't like those stiff-back, clean-hand, little pussies. New Vegas belongs to the people.
neutral|They took pride in their craft. I don't think Omertas saw other people as people at all. Everyone else was just... prey.
fear|One of ours is down!
disgust|Try robbing me, will you?
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
anger|You took out a Deathclaw nest? Either you're lying, or you're tougher than you look.
joy|I've heard of you. You're just the kind of person I'm looking for. Not afraid of stepping on a few toes to get a job done. Think you can lend a hand?
neutral|I'm going to start heading back to California now. I'm not about to let myself get killed by future NCR incompetence.
joy|With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
neutral|Know that your efforts are appreciated and will not go unrewarded. But we can speak of that later.
neutral|I have no idea where he is, but at least we're free from his abuse.
neutral|Please disperse.
neutral|I was expecting a shipment of chemicals. It's usually in a suitcase dropped off in one of the big machines up here.
anger|See ya around.
anger|You better be sleeping with one eye open.
joy|Lady Luck smiled on our President.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|I'm on my way to meet that Boomer you told me about!
surprise|Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
neutral|We've got three fiends ready for our Cazadores.
surprise|They covet our ladyfolk's long hair for wigs, it's said, being either bald or balding themselves.
disgust|For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
neutral|VStoryEventBennyKilledFort to 1.
surprise|You can get involved if you want to, but I'll be over here.
surprise|We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
disgust|Take your time - the ghoul's not going anywhere.
anger|My take? I try not to think about it, I got enough on my hands here.
surprise|You're the talk of the day around the casino tables.
disgust|Murderer!
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
neutral|Security is led by a Ranger Grant. He's a pretty rough guy who's seen a lot of combat. It's best if you steer clear of him.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
anger|I will overlook this error, but only because I think you can still be useful.
anger|Don't go messing around with the Fiends.
fear|Uh-huh. Sorry stranger, just not sure I trust that kind of charity from somebody I don't even know.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
neutral|So fucked up I can't feel my legs.
neutral|Well, it has been awhile. All right, let's do this.
neutral|Here, this is edible.
anger|You're lucky we Followers tend to be forgiving.
joy|Time to hit the showers!
joy|You talking about Mr. Isaac? Damn, baby, when you bring them in, you bring them *in!* That cat's gonna bring me money like you wouldn't believe.
joy|Well don't let me stop you then.
neutral|Thank Mars. The assault can resume.
anger|Well hurry it up and get your shit together.
joy|One of these days, Red Lucy's going to show off her Deathclaws.
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
neutral|We aren't assigned for a suicide mission. Give us something we can do, and we'll do it. However I am not sending my unit on a suicide run.
anger|Why are you even talking to me?
anger|Had enough?
anger|So you're the one causing all the ruckus at The Tops. You're lucky you're not under my jurisdiction or I'd have tossed you in a cell for that.
joy|I'll see you around.
anger|You dirty coward!
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
joy|Our luck has gone south since we lost all of our money gambling in Vegas. We didn't go AWOL from duty to become raiders.
anger|Come on!
surprise|If the Legion can equip their men so well, maybe they can take care of me too.
surprise|Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
neutral|If you should find it, do not - repeat, do not - belittle a Super Mutant for taking the bunny slope.
neutral|Look alive, guys, you're on NCR time.
fear|Hello...?
neutral|Ordinary guys with knives and bullets, and they're taking over Nevada.
anger|I said it was a start. This town... nobody looks me straight in the eye anymore.
joy|Almost done here. What do you say you have a look at this? Tell me what you see.
disgust|Three years and counting. If I could just get across the river, I'd be free. Not that I'd try it - I've seen what happens when you get caught.
anger|I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
anger|Then you're a fucking dream come true, ain't ya? How much you gonna give me?
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
neutral|Yep, get a move on.
anger|It just so happens a position opened up recently. We currently need another body to guard the entrance outside. Think you can handle that?
neutral|With Caesar dead, it's hard to know what to expect. The Legate, Lanius, is renowned as a brutal man, not a subtle tactician.
neutral|Main force got spotted too soon. We heard shooting. Then Khans started coming through Canyon 37 in bunches.
neutral|Confirmed. We'll stay with you and help you break through the line.
joy|I heard you talking to Horowitz, and can't thank you enough for what you've done for us.
neutral|You have?
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
neutral|I've been spying in the dam for a while now. I've gathered quite a bit of information from various sources.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
surprise|Thank God. Let me down, please!
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
joy|I was starting to get lonely out here by myself.
anger|I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
neutral|Look, I already told Chomps that the NCR's getting suspicious of all these "misplaced" supplies. Bigger risk means bigger cost - 300 caps bigger.
anger|Whatever you're selling, I ain't buying.
surprise|All hell broke loose when the creatures escaped from The Thorn!
neutral|For example, a hundred bucks in NCR money is valued at roughly half that in caps around here. Seems like a rotten deal for us, but work is work.
surprise|Naw, man, more like... drug suppliers. Yeah. Other folks sell 'em. Diane's mostly in charge of that.
joy|I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
neutral|I am the commander of this army. The Son of Mars has granted me the name Lanius. And the time to serve him has come once more.
joy|I appreciate your concern for Bitter Springs. You've already been quite helpful to the NCR, I suppose it's only right to return the favor.
surprise|So all this time the old man had an entire army on lay-away? Clever player.
anger|I have my doubts about Caesar, yes, but I won't publicly go against Papa Khan based on nothing more than doubts.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|We'll have to conduct a thorough investigation of all our quartermasters, and crack down on sloppy record-keeping. Thank you.
joy|Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
anger|They killed her!
neutral|Don't even think about it. Any Brotherhood survivors likely harbor a deep grudge against us. We can't afford to leave such an enemy alive.
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
neutral|I'm not at liberty to divulge what was said, but I've been instructed to send you to him immediately.
anger|
surprise|Never seen a guardian dog like that before.
disgust|Those rockets over at REPCONN were the NCR's doing. Trying to keep us scared so they can stick around to "protect" us.
joy|Let me know if you need anything else.
neutral|If you want to help us, you'll have to come up with something better than suicide!
neutral|Come on, big man, roll up in here!
neutral|It started off innocently enough. I was traveling, as I often do, and happened to observe you picking up one of those blue-star caps.
anger|Had enough?
sadness|My Father? A trading business that he'll never own, risking his neck every day against Wastelanders and cut-throat "merchants."
surprise|Well, I'll be damned. Looks like you've got some dirt in you after all.
surprise|I heard you've killed Deathclaws at The Thorn. I couldn't believe it!
joy|Thanks again for looking into my missing medical supplies. Now I can actually use them on people that need them.
sadness|Don't think I'll make it topside any time soon.
anger|You've helped me see Caesar for what he is, and I thank you for that - but if you suggest that again I will have your head.
surprise|We've heard about you from the officers at our embassy.
anger|They killed her!
neutral|Okay. Well, when you do, let me know, all right?
joy|Not so much lately. The NCR is giving them hell any time they poke their damned heads out. Bless those boys and gals for getting rid of that vermin.
sadness|I'm gonna miss having Anderson around.
neutral|Be well. And do try and avoid the tragic path of the sot that led me to my present infirmities and spiritual woes.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
neutral|I got a pressure in me like Hoover Dam.
anger|You're right. A Khan's vengeance should be direct and bloody. No more skulking in caves - I'll remind the NCR why they feared us!
neutral|I know there's counterfeit caps floating around, of course. Fortunately, they're very time-consuming to make, so the numbers are small.
anger|I'd almost expect something direct from them, but given the circumstances there's a possibility of something more subtle like sabotage.
neutral|Let's take a look... exceptional synapse responses... descended from some type of cattle dog, I imagine.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|Okay. Hold still. I don't want to make this any more painful than it already is.
joy|I guess I got a face only a mother could love, because nobody else would give me the time of day.
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
fear|Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
joy|Add in the troopers marching back and forth from McCarran and the Dam, and well, let's just say we don't miss Primm.
surprise|People of my trade respect the merchants of these territories.
joy|The Lucky 38, all lit up in the distance? It's an inviting target.
joy|You help me, and before long the Chairmen will rule all of Vegas, dig? With enough robot muscle to back it up.
neutral|I'll have a security team sweep the area to see if the Legion has any more surprises for us.
joy|Take care of yourself out there. And if you ever need a friendly hand, know that folks around here will always welcome you.
neutral|Well, I guess so.  Look.  We just need metal, and lots of it.
neutral|Done. Setting VMS24 to stage 10.
neutral|What happened at Nelson and Camp Forlorn Hope?
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
neutral|However, their activity has quieted down some so maybe my original information was wrong.
neutral|Those last five shots were a bad idea...
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
neutral|Probably the best thing we've got going on is the co-op, run by Mr. Ettienne. Gets some help from of the Followers of the Apocalypse, I think.
surprise|Aha!
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
joy|I hope the Fiends have learned their lesson.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
anger|That won't do... at all. Listen, it can't be the jet, Cachino's got her scared shitless.
anger|Can't grow crops if they don't give us the water.
joy|I'm glad to see you.
sadness|I'll send word to Major Polatli.
neutral|Sure thing. What's on your noggin?
neutral|We haven't been able to determine whom they've been meeting with, but if it's Caesar's men, we'll need to act.
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
disgust|I'm going to look over here now.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
surprise|Aha!
anger|Quit screwing around!
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
joy|Good to see them bullets didn't affect your charm none.
neutral|I don't know. Some kind of man-fish freak like the one I killed over there.
anger|I'm not going to talk to you!
surprise|It's the House edge, baby - literally. It's what Mr. House needs to stack the odds in his favor.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
neutral|The print-out I've given you lists every lead I've been able to uncover. See what you can find out.
sadness|Can't b-b-believe Betsy's gone. S-s-she was a bitch, b-but she was my p-p-partner, you know?
joy|Okay, if you want a little work, I think I can find you something.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
sadness|Wake up, sleepyhead! Wake up? ...Please?
neutral|Why's everything spinning?
neutral|And sometimes it's more like we protect ourselves from them and hope to outlive them and become humanity's sole heirs.
joy|We do have some spare Rad-X in the supply tent. That might work. Thank you.
neutral|Freesiders are hoping they'll drop food. I wouldn't get your hopes up, Freesiders.
anger|What the hell?!
neutral|Is there a place to grab food by the monorail?
anger|Alright. Here, I'll give you some of what I stole, just don't mention this to anyone.
neutral|VStoryEventVisitsLucky38 set to 1.
surprise|You don't want to do that, baby. Whatever's down in that bunker is the key to the city called Vegas. So here's what you do...
neutral|Then we have an agreement. Thank you for keeping my secret - such a thing will never happen again.
anger|Damn!
fear|Time to get scarce!
neutral|When Carla went missing he was the first person I told.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
anger|They killed her!
surprise|Huh? Look, kitty cat, me and Diane, we don't dig on that politics stuff, savvy? We just make the product and make it get to a good home.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
neutral|Hey, you did it! Nice work!
anger|Obviously you don't know the first damn thing about the Rangers. Without them, nobody in these parts would be safe.
anger|Light 'em up!
anger|Look out!
neutral|Bye.
neutral|VStoryEventKimballAssassination set to 1.
neutral|Not interested? Not interested?
neutral|I swear the monorail was *just* ahead... somewhere.
neutral|And just about every one of them is occupied. Not all at the same time, usually - groups of Legionaries come and go all the time.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
joy|The power station, the dam, they're my babies. Well... don't tell my grandchildren I said that. Anything in here that I haven't rebuilt I've fixed.
fear|Not really, but we don't have much choice. If you help out more around the camp I could spare some additional men for the battle.
anger|Tyrone wasn't authorized to deliver any of this. There were reports of our supplies being used by the Great Khans to make illegal chems.
anger|He's trying to pull a fast one on the big man? Crazy bastard. You got any more?
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
joy|Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
anger|What are you waiting for? Do it!
neutral|They're a bunch of escaped cons from down south. The NCR was using them to maintain the railways as part of their sentence.
anger|Legion bastards. They'll pay for that.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
anger|Done fucking around? Good.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
anger|Damn!
sadness|Yeah. I mean, no, they're okay people, but they don't care, y'know? They don't have any ambition. No drive.
sadness|No, I suppose not.
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
disgust|Consider yourself lucky.
joy|I am one of the frumentarii: it is my duty to scout the Wastes in Caesar's name and make contact with any tribes that might serve a useful purpose.
neutral|Yeah. We were.
disgust|How do they expect us to fight the Legion with only the crappy equipment and gear they gave us?
neutral|Of course.
disgust|All I wanted was a little escape, so I took some drugs to help me do that. Is that so bad?
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
fear|What do you want with me?
anger|Not the point I was aiming for but, well, let's see this through.
neutral|For sale? I'm a slave, not a merchant. I could give you some healing powder every day, but you'd have to be a friend of the Legion.
joy|Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
anger|What have you done?
anger|What have you done?
neutral|Yeah, sure.
joy|NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
anger|What was that for?
neutral|All I know is he's supposed to be in charge of the Strip. And he's been able to stop the NCR from taking it over.
joy|You've got a point. Selling meds to the locals could be a pretty nice side gig. All right, I'll tell Jack to give it a try.
fear|Aaaah!
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
anger|You're dead!
anger|You dirty coward!
fear|Have you found out anything to help me?
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|Let's get one thing straight. I see any crimson, I'm taking the shot. You don't like that, you're on your own.
surprise|I've never seen a robot like that before.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
surprise|With luck like yours I'm surprised them bullets didn't just turn right around and climb back into the gun.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
fear|Why's that tower on the Strip all fucking lit up now, huh? I don't like it.
joy|It was a matter of time before someone got to Mr. House.
disgust|There should be patrols. Checkpoints. We got greedy, overstretched. Now our own territory isn't secure.
surprise|Careful!
neutral|We've got a lot to do to prepare for the President's visit and not much time. Once we start we'll be on a strict timetable.
surprise|What? How'd you get past the guards?
neutral|The Old Mormon Fort serves as the regional hub for the Followers of the Apocalypse. I am the administrator for this region.
neutral|The Empathy Synthesizer will allow you to more easily pick up on subtle emotions and body language. The price is 4,000 caps.
joy|Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|He was dead when I got there.
anger|I understand you've been talking to the Great Khans about breaking their oaths to great Caesar. I would call that... unwise.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
neutral|Medicine time!
neutral|Don't think your servile gesture earns my respect, stranger. But if that's how you want it, so it'll be.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
joy|Another satisfied customer.
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
joy|And we were wondering if you could help us. If it's not too much trouble, of course.
surprise|Holy shit!
sadness|I... uh... I never... I never thought about that.
joy|And that's it for our tour today, Rocketeers - RobCo and its tiny partner REPCONN thank you! Any further questions, please, feel free to ask.
fear|Damn it all to hell!
surprise|That wasn't a nice thing to do!
neutral|Thank you! Thank you so much!
joy|All right, honey baby, this is all kinds of wrong, but to my suite it is. Thirteenth floor. Don't keep me waiting.
anger|I should make you pay for your crimes!
surprise|Everyone's talking about Hoover Dam nowadays. I wish the battle would just happen already. The suspense is killing me.
disgust|Murderer!
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
fear|Chip hurt bear heads! Stupid head voices afraid.
surprise|If you had asked me a month ago, I'd have said we'd never willingly work with the NCR. But look at us now.
neutral|Well it was metal, and kind of thick. At first I thought he'd come from Gomorrah, but they're more into leather there.
joy|My lucky day, running into our President's savior!
sadness|Hm.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
anger|You've heard the news about President Kimball? Thank God he survived, but I hope the Rangers hunt down the miserable traitor that tried to kill him.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
joy|There's always more next day.
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
anger|Still plenty of troubles out that way, though. Thanks for playing.
neutral|I knew I couldn't "save the world," nor did I care to. But I could save Vegas, and in the process, perhaps, save mankind.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
surprise|What the fuck? Oh shit. Yeah, go talk to Nero or Big Sal upstairs. They'll want to see this. I'll send Cachino to the office as well.
joy|Thanks for your help. I can finally get out of this place.
anger|Weeks of effort to convince those miserable Khans to join the Legion - ruined. Any other crimes?
neutral|All right. Sit still and let me work.
anger|It should've been me, not her... They will pay, right now! Out of my way!
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
anger|Had enough?
fear|Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
anger|That's not a good idea.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
disgust|Got leveled by a goddamn courier - screw the message, it's the messenger that'll fuck you.
anger|Do a fucking headcount, then. Everybody's right where they're supposed to be.
neutral|Gamma wave activity is... zero? That can't be right. Must be a result of the interference.
surprise|People lived in here for hundreds of years, can you imagine?
joy|Here. These are yours. Was all you had on you when you was brought in.
joy|Lady Luck smiled on our President.
joy|Sure thing, baby. What can Tommy do for you?
surprise|Grenade!
joy|Baby, you're the boss. All you gotta do is whistle.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
disgust|Oh, I wouldn't dream of getting too far away, boss.
surprise|That NCR prez survived a Legion hit? Wouldn'ta guessed.
anger|Now you're just talking crazy. No way Benny'd risk something like that. What else you got?
sadness|It's hard to stay awake on watch with only a few hours of sleep. I wish we actually had time to rest around here.
neutral|Seems I'm fortunate to get that much for them, given the circumstances!
anger|Don't fuck with the caged beasts.
joy|We owe you so much for saving our President.
surprise|I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
joy|It's just little old me. Nothing to be afraid of.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
fear|We have a decent amount of men, but it'll be a close battle. If you help out more around the camp, I could probably spare some additional troops.
anger|Grrrraah!
neutral|No. I wanted to. I just couldn't.
neutral|There's people you love, people you'll never speak to again, and it's always awkward when you run into someone you used to date.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
joy|They must have run straight back to camp. I bet they didn't even stop and say thanks.
anger|That's not a good idea.
anger|That's not a good idea.
neutral|"The last thing you never see."
neutral|Nowadays I'm usually sent to do business with traders at places like the 188. But sometimes I think it's just to keep me out of everyone's hair.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
surprise|What?! Oh shit... how the fuck?! Oh man, I'm in some deep shit now.
neutral|Use extreme caution when approaching the base. Their firepower is... considerable.
surprise|I just don't get it. A stiff breeze'd tear you in two but a couple of bullets and you're right as rain.
neutral|Alcohol and all chems, including stims and other addictive items.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|VStoryEventNelson set to 3.
neutral|No. Our case wouldn't be any stronger if tomorrow they all died when their energy weapons backfired.
joy|I wouldn't mind hitting that. She put out?
anger|They killed her!
anger|Locked and loaded!
joy|Traveling into the Strip just got a lot easier now that the Fiends' leaders are dead.
joy|There was no player who'd stood a chance, no wiseguy who didn't fear me, and no doll who could resist me. Gomorrah was my kingdom, Carlitos' turf!
neutral|Oh - I've been using two roots per flower. Thanks to you, I'll be able to create twice as much healing powder per day.
neutral|The fountain is a restricted area.
neutral|Some of our people think they had some means of conveyance, like the vertibirds the Enclave used, and hightailed it out of here.
joy|Her eyes are bright as radioactive sludge, glowing with the light of love.
anger|Flank 'em!
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
surprise|Hey!
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|The Legion will mount a ferocious and determined frontal assault from the east, that much is certain.
anger|Come on!
neutral|A mob of dangerous creatures of all different species has been terrorizing locals in Westside. The cause of the attacks is thus far unknown.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
joy|This place smells like booze and sex. That's why I always come back.
sadness|That's enough of that! If you're going to get us out of here, it'll have to be another way.
neutral|The same equipment failure that prevents me from remotely operating this facility seems to have activated its security robots and turrets.
anger|You've heard the news about President Kimball? If I got my hands on the traitor that killed him....
joy|I hope you're doing well, friend!
anger|Go on then. Elevators are past the slot machines on your right.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
anger|Had enough?
surprise|Hell of a thing about Chief Hanlon. I never would have guessed he was capable of it.
neutral|Besides, most of these crops look fine to me. If the farmers can't handle the job, they shouldn't have signed up in the first place.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
neutral|He's coming to give a big fancy speech to all of us troops stationed here at the dam.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|Ah, well... I just felt like it was time, you know? Wanted to have a home.
joy|I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
disgust|Better not try that again.
surprise|I've never seen a robot like that before.
neutral|What, we leaving *already?*
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
fear|I'm not scared of you. Give me a good reason to call the law and, I swear, you'll regret it.
neutral|We believe that technology for basic necessities, like food, water, and medicine, should be shared, not hoarded.
sadness|What I really need are medical texts - books on psychology or pediatrics, specifically.
sadness|I suppose there was always that risk. It's just that Jason was so certain...
sadness|I'll cover you from the ridge. Just make it quick. These boys should be put out of their misery, not plinked to death with some old varmint rifle.
neutral|On how many can you take, stranger?
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
surprise|Hey!
joy|One of these days, Red Lucy's going to show off her Deathclaws.
surprise|The Khans used to be a big deal around here, but look at them now. There's talk that they were all killed up in the mountains.
sadness|Look... I'm stuck here, I know that. Carlitos is the only thing that kept me going, and now I don't have anything left.
anger|Look out!
anger|Beat it, or I'll call the bots on you right quick.
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
sadness|Like I told you, I can't go anywhere without getting out of my contract with Garret first. Talk to him, maybe he'll cut me loose if you ask nice.
disgust|Do you need something, or are you just here to cause trouble?
joy|That's exactly what we needed to put a cork in that camp. The Legion won't be moving through there anytime soon.
anger|Wait until we get to the Presidential, pally. I don't need you tugging at my sleeve.
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
neutral|But when he tells me to push the middle button to divert the intake, and the right button feels nicer when I touch it, I know where my loyalty is.
fear|Mercy!
joy|This bunker protects the entrance to the vault - solid stone outside and thick steel on the inside!
sadness|Okay, we can have more fun together, but it's not going to be free, hon.
anger|What do you need?
anger|I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
disgust|You've done an excelent job ingratiating yourself to the top brass. I assume this is some sort of strategem?
anger|What do you want?
neutral|We held HELIOS One for a time. Lost a lot of people defending it. Too many. All for this weapon they never got working.
joy|I hope Red Lucy gives us the *big* monsters, next.
neutral|How could you? You're too scared to look.
surprise|Holy shit!
anger|Gotcha!
joy|House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
joy|My lucky day, running into our President's savior!
joy|Thanks.
anger|How ya like being Miss Good-Two-Shoes, hey? How's it feeling?
neutral|Please do. An outbreak of pustulah-whatever is the last thing we need.
anger|We'll get 'em.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
neutral|VStoryEventNelson set to 1.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
surprise|Where'd he go?
neutral|The NCR's been mining there for awhile, but now it's full of Deathclaws. Don't go there unless you want a quick, bloody death.
surprise|Might be too big. Even for us.
neutral|Here's Bing Crosby reminding us of those times when you absolutely have to kiss the person you love. "Something's Gotta Give," up next.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
anger|We'll get 'em.
disgust|Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
neutral|Why's everything spinning?
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
joy|All right, I'm going to get Ethel far away from this damned city and head back home. There's a worthy life waiting for us there.
fear|Oh my! Keep me out of this!
joy|Aren't you the guy that helped wipe out Nelson?
neutral|NCR: Wild Child.
joy|Well, you have been a great help here, and with the saboteur dealt with... Yes, I think we can spare a few men. Consider it done.
disgust|As if I'd know what to do if I found something.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
neutral|Deliver this invoice to Dr. Hildern. You can find him somewhere inside Camp McCarran.
disgust|Yeah, sure, whatever. I'm done with you.
joy|My buddies at Camp McCarran are breathing easy now that the Fiends' leader is dead.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
neutral|Sure, what's on your mind?
neutral|Freeside: Rascal.
neutral|Alright.
neutral|If you're sure. There's a lot of high ground around the town. We could do a lot of damage.
surprise|Fire!
neutral|Need anything else?
neutral|Possible causes suggested were engineering mistakes, centuries-old equipment, and the fact that the rockets were piloted by a cult of crazy ghouls.
sadness|That's it, then. How did you know?
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
anger|Now you're starting to piss me off.
surprise|If the Legion can equip their men so well, maybe they can take care of me too.
surprise|You've taken down Cazadores! Didn't think I'd ever see that.
disgust|I'm afraid I have no desire to socialize with unstable elements such as yourself.
neutral|Let's hear it.
neutral|It was such an incredible thing she did, putting her life on the line like that for my husband. It's not something most people would do.
surprise|Your robot looks worth quite a few caps.
anger|My buddies at McCarran will find the asshole that destroyed our Monorail.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
anger|Cut it out, will you?
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
neutral|Hey, that's just business.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
neutral|Guess I did. Guess I figured whatever we could handle, this time the Legion was going to send more.
anger|You'll make Leo angry!
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
neutral|Food shortages and mass starvation are plaguing Freeside and the Strip in the wake of a sharp reduction in the area's beef supply.
neutral|Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there. It is obvious you don't know what you're doing!
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
disgust|You'll pay for that!
joy|Oh, that makes me so happy! You are too much!
anger|What stalemate? It is Caesar's will that I hold this position - that I not advance.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
disgust|While I have already internalized the new skills we have discussed, I feel as though my solution was nevertheless more practical.
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
surprise|We've heard about you from the officers at our embassy.
joy|That'd be swell. Only, if they knew the idea came from me, they probably wouldn't take you serious no more, so maybe you oughta think about it first.
anger|What makes you think I give a damn about you?
anger|You just made a big mistake.
neutral|If they're more powerful than the Profligates' landmines, by all means show me how.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
neutral|Once the new codes are in use, anyone still using the old codes will just hear static if they're listening in on our frequencies.
anger|What was that for?
joy|If you pull them out, my men will shoot you. Understand?
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
anger|We'll get 'em.
neutral|Thanks, that'll help.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
neutral|VStoryEventCampGolf set to 2.
anger|Well, well. Congratulations on getting the Mark II prototype functional, doctor. Now just hand it over and we'll be on our way.
joy|All right! See you soon.
neutral|Much obliged.
fear|It took every Stealth Boy I had to cross the river at Cottonwood Cove. That was a close shave, riding a boat full of Legion boys.
neutral|So long, stranger.
anger|What the hell do you want?
anger|Flank 'em!
joy|Well... sometimes I sneak into the medical tent at night and "borrow" some of the medical supplies.
neutral|So fucked up I can't feel my legs.
anger|What have you done?
neutral|You're no friend to the Great Khans. You should turn around and leave - and if we see you in the Mojave, well... accidents happen.
joy|So, what do you want to do with what you've got?
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
fear|Leave me alone!
neutral|It was not intended for war - its top sides are bound to two intake towers by a series of bridges. No doubt snipers nest there.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
disgust|Better not try that again.
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
surprise|You don't want anything in return? That's rare in these times, got to say.
surprise|Sorry, it's just... you look like his type, y'know? You got that hard-ass wasteland explorer thing going on.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
anger|What the fuck are you trying to pull here? Where is my girl? Now I'm gonna have to kill your sorry ass.
neutral|Fool! We've fortified this place to hold out indefinitely against an army. What chance do you think you have?
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
anger|Make it quick.
anger|We'll get 'em.
fear|I've gleaned a lot, working with Mr. House. He was a good cat to swing with. I still got more to learn, but it's... it's coming together.
surprise|I've never seen so many pretty lights in my life.
surprise|You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
neutral|I was down here for most of it, so I can't tell you much of what the boys with the guns were doing up top.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
surprise|Huh. I guess it's all right, then.
neutral|Ugh. I figured you were a bit slow, but I never thought - forget it, it's done.
anger|As a young man I was taught to venerate President Tandi of Shady Sands. "The Founding Mother of the New California Republic."
neutral|Some kind of tech... I'm gonna say... mid-2200s. Hold onto it. Might be your lucky chip.
neutral|Yeah. You can tell by the patch. Bear skull with crossed rifles behind it. Slogan underneath.
joy|The cowboy act? Yeah, he dropped on in here not too long before you. He's got chops, baby, real chops, and I ain't just talking about that mustache.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
neutral|So long, stranger.
neutral|I also regard it a certainty that the Chip was discovered, taken from you, and given to Caesar - who returned it to you.
joy|You're always welcome among the Followers, friend.
anger|Behave yourself from now on, you hear?
anger|What was that for?
sadness|I hope nothing happens on my watch. I'm too damn tired to fight back right now.
anger|You sick, vindictive fuck!
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
neutral|I've compared the brain chemistry of a Nightkin to one of the local Nightstalkers we killed. They both exhibit similar neurochemical changes.
neutral|That's why I'm trying to hand you my scheme, baby. It's called having a legacy.
neutral|Uh... I think I should check it out first before radioing it in.
surprise|Sure, what do you want to know?
sadness|<Sighs> I know.
disgust|I tried to tell him, but he insisted that the largest console had to be the most important. Still, it's only a matter of time.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
sadness|Cool. Maybe later.
joy|I almost went ape! So, we convinced him - okay, Sheldon and I, right? We convinced him to leave the top level mostly intact!
joy|A Ranger, here in the Strip? Fine company, sir!
joy|Here, I salvaged this book from an old library. It's a history of a people called the Mongols. I think that's what the Khans built their culture on.
joy|Good to see a friend of our government.
anger|You're lucky we Followers tend to be forgiving.
neutral|Their landmines have caused us more trouble than their marksmanship - which is lacking.
disgust|Well, if it isn't the loose cannon that's been wandering the Mojave Wasteland. What do you want?
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
joy|Excellent! Squad readiness records can be accessed from two terminals at the resort: the main terminal in the lobby or a secure one in a back office.
anger|I'd kill you right now if I could.
surprise|Found you!
surprise|These bots now have eyes on their backs, I swear!
fear|That's... pretty shady, yeah. Could be Benny's up to no good, could be this is somebody else altogether. What else you got?
disgust|Damn Brahmin crap everywhere.
anger|What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
fear|Help!
joy|About to get loud!
joy|I wanted to thank you for stopping the Omertas. That could have gone poorly for us if it wasn't for you.
neutral|Success depends on forcing the NCR to rout from Hoover Dam. Hmm, does giving then a powerful ally in the battle make that more or less likely?
neutral|We'd see them occasionally, but they didn't seem too keen on getting too close to the quarry. Not sure if it was the noise or all the workers.
sadness|Cool. Maybe later.
neutral|All right, girls, show's over.
neutral|In retrospect, the Mojave and Hoover Dam will seem like one man's misadventure. Kimball will be blamed, not me. Not New Vegas.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
anger|What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
neutral|The president's Vertibird crashed into the side of the Dam as he departed following the address. Authorities suspect sabotage.
anger|You dirty coward!
sadness|This place's got a weird gloom after Miss Weintraub died.
anger|Dammit, I'll find them eventually! Mark my words!
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
joy|Those Legion beasts needed to be put down, like the vermin they are!
neutral|Can you get it through your thick skull to leave me and the Chip alone? If bullets can't get through, what hope is there?
neutral|That looks like all of them.
neutral|Sure.
neutral|Lily might be interested in coming with you - she's lost a few of her Bighorners to Nightstalker attacks and would enjoy a little revenge.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
anger|This is no time for questions! Get back topside and protect the president!
surprise|Grenade!
joy|Howdy, come try your luck? I hope's on your side.
anger|Damn!
anger|Some Legionaries snuck into the camp and set off some kind of radiation bomb.
anger|Fighting was part of my studies.
neutral|Even if what you're saying is true, I think I'll take my chances. This necklace and I have been through a lot, and we're both still kicking.
neutral|You can bet on the contenders or, if you have what it takes, be one of the contenders.
neutral|Goodbye.
surprise|Not much. They found us when we came to the Mojave, gave us a bunch of books on science and history - I guess they're like teachers or something?
neutral|On the other hand, if the Legion goes for a full-scale attack, we'll see 'em coming, fall back, and wait for reinforcements.
surprise|He wants to kill me? What did I ever do to him?
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
joy|I was worried Alexus had already thrown them down a mineshaft. I'll run by camp and see how they're doing when I get a chance. Thanks for the help.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
neutral|I do have some information that could help you.
neutral|Here.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|You do? Why, that's just wonderful! I'll take them and put them with the rest of the collection.
surprise|Hey!
joy|Here I was thinking you'd be a challenge, want a rematch?
neutral|Very well.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
disgust|If you're here to sell something, we don't want any.
surprise|Whoa!
anger|Maybe it's not the Legion that got them killed. Maybe it's your orders and you following them.
anger|That isn't yours!
surprise|Isn't that Cass? I heard she'd gotten out of the caravan business.
joy|Don't be shy. I'm always happy to make a new friend.
joy|Ready to die for your country, you commie son of a bitch?
joy|I had dinner at the Ultra-Luxe the other night. I told them my steak tasted funny. They said it was a clown.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
fear|All the noise at REPCONN scared the hell out of me.
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
anger|Last we spoke, you were leaning in more merciful direction...?
fear|Really? Well, this canyon used to be a Great Khan stronghold, I suppose that explains why he was able to evade us so easily.
neutral|They sure as shit did. I mean there's still formalities, like I have to run everything by Lawson before I do it.
joy|Since you have some medical experience I'd like you to examine them and see what you can do to treat them.
anger|When the time comes, I'll be the one to kill you.
neutral|And yet you managed to slip past. Impressive. You may not find the fighting to the west quite so easy to get around, however.
anger|Family, the fucking Omertas. Are you new around here or what?
neutral|Wow, don't everybody volunteer all at once now.
neutral|You are in charge of this operation. That sounds like a suicide mission, but our order are to take commands from you.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
surprise|What, was I not doing it right before?
joy|Ha! Yes, you are quite the smoothtalker. What the hell - 250 it is.
anger|Grrrraah!
anger|Quit goofing off and clear the channel. I'll be damned if the President dies on my watch because you were screwing around.
joy|That Caesar bastard had it coming.
joy|Baby, you're the boss. All you gotta do is whistle.
joy|You can't hide from me.
anger|All right. I'll let it go - this time.
anger|It's your own fault for finding this - now I'm going to have to kill you.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
neutral|Very well.
neutral|Here.
anger|Just keep on walking.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
joy|With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
sadness|Oh, no! Grandma's little pumpkin! Rraaaargh!
fear|I'm not a threat to anyone!
joy|New Vegas, paradise, my ass.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
neutral|It's not always that simple. But I think the cause is still right.
neutral|Respect, nothing. She plans to whisper in his ear. Poison him against the Codex.
anger|Haven't you heard anything I've said?! Don't you understand?!
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
joy|What else? I'm in charge. This whole operation depends on me. No Fantastic, no power. Got the whole NCR suckling my teats, and it feels so good.
joy|Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
fear|Oh, uh, hey.
neutral|Stay safe.
neutral|Fair enough. It's not like any of the troopers around here are jumping up to volunteer.
neutral|I'm asking our top hunters to gather Cazador eggs. I'd be impressed by whoever returns with such a prize.
anger|Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
joy|Now we can actually try to strengthen our forces along the river and prepare for the upcoming battle at Hoover Dam.
anger|What was that for?
disgust|You'll pay for that!
neutral|I think it is safe to move up.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|It's always in the last place you look. I wonder why that is.
joy|Good to hear. This is the bug you'll need for the radio.
neutral|I swear... I'm not drinking... ever... again.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
disgust|Murderer!
surprise|Guess I just had a natural talent for it. When I was a kid, these cats called the Followers of the Apocalypse came to our camp.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|I really need to find my helmet though. Thanks anyway.
fear|It's a, uh, necklace that I made out of these special caps. You ever see any caps with a blue star on them like these?
anger|Grrrraah!
neutral|Now that that's out of the way, let's see... Mr. House was a concern, but someone conveniently dealt with him for us.
neutral|However, these pronounced effects will allow me to pinpoint exactly what parts of the brain they're affecting.
neutral|What, we leaving *already?*
neutral|Yeah, like get the key from the slavemaster or pay him to release us?
neutral|Then you'll need to make sure none of them are left to do so. Any other questions?
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
anger|We'll get 'em.
neutral|Sir! I don't know what happened, a bunch of Legionnaires just stormed into the power station.
joy|The warrior who was not yet Lanius went insane with rage. He struck down his Chieftain and attacked his own tribe.
anger|Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
neutral|All right. Sit still and let me work.
neutral|I'd love to help you and Chomps, but I got my own expenses to worry about.
anger|I'm not going to talk to you!
fear|I've been trying to sort out the rumors from the facts, but with the Legion coming, I guess it doesn't matter. The news is all bad.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
joy|Yeah? Hey, sure, that would be fantastic!
joy|Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
joy|That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
fear|Alright calm down buddy. I don't wanna provoke you. I'll let you ask the questions.
neutral|Well, it was nice to meet you. I'm going to take a few moments to get myself together, then head out.
joy|Good to see a friend of our government.
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
anger|What have you done?
anger|Looks like the President's security detail was too good for you, huh, shitbird?
sadness|Hell of a battle at Forlorn Hope. I hope the brass can do something for the troopers' families.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
fear|You're not going to cause any problems, right?
surprise|The Kings got hit hard. I don't know how many of them are still alive, if any.
anger|
joy|House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
joy|You can't hide from me.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
anger|Get your own!
surprise|Whoa!
neutral|So what? I don't give a shit about what you like. Go cry to your mama.
surprise|Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
neutral|Is there anything else I can help you with?
surprise|What in the goddamn...?
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
neutral|We do need it. Still, I wish there was something we could give you in return.
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
neutral|All right, fair enough. You help us out, and I'll owe you one.
anger|We don't have many troops, so we can only attack from one direction. Where should we focus the attack?
surprise|I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
joy|Nice try. Let's play another game.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
neutral|I wasn't able to find a final itinerary for his visit, but if you can find one, you can get more details on what's going to happen.
fear|The NCR's coming for us! Waste the hostages!
anger|Is there some reason I should be talking to you?
neutral|Snipers and sharpshooters have been assigned to key locations and we also have a special K9 unit sniffing out members of the crowd.
sadness|I wish the rest of the Vault were accessible.
fear|This can't be happening!
surprise|Aha!
anger|Dammit, I thought I had you there. Let's play again.
anger|Fuck this place.
anger|You dirty coward!
surprise|Put that down!
anger|I warned you. Intruder!
neutral|You think we can make it? You really do?
sadness|As the biggest one it was my job to go join the Army so's my sisters could eat and so's we wouldn't all be killed by raiders and Jesus would love us.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
joy|Oh, hey. What's up?
joy|I heard that some of the NCR Rangers are on their way to help us out. We'll make short work of the Legion with their help.
surprise|Nothing gets by you, huh? Coulda used you when I lost my keys last month.
surprise|Hey!
anger|Come back when you have news about the Boomers.
anger|I tell you, something stinks about this Monorail attack!
anger|They killed him!
anger|You disgust me. How dare you say such a filthy thing in my establishment? I ought to have you arrested.
anger|Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker when I find out who did it.
surprise|Found you!
neutral|Okay, you're a dangerous sort. I get that. But I have some information I think you'll find useful, which made me follow you for a spell.
neutral|Can barely see the street.
joy|I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
anger|What the hell?!
joy|Haven't started it yet. Are you interested to hear about it now?
neutral|So all you gotta do now is talk to Yes Man, figure out how to set things in motion.
joy|It took everything we had in the last battle at the dam to stand against those brutes. You're a beast, son.
anger|Or else what, punk? Or else this?
joy|Gives me a chance to practice my backhand.
joy|Did you hear? We're going to join the Great Khans.
disgust|Anyone with medical training had their hands full for weeks after the battle was finally over.
neutral|Move up to the next position.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
neutral|Residents report briefly seeing a column of heavenly light coming out of the sky. Apocalypse predictors haven't been this excited since the War.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
neutral|I have it on good authority that the owner, Cass, wants out of the caravan business.
anger|Then what the hell do you want? Don't try anything, I mean it!
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
neutral|I got a pressure in me like Hoover Dam.
neutral|I suppose.
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
sadness|I guess... I guess it's the only chance I've got. Maybe it'll be different this time. I was never a Saint before.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
disgust|I'm a ranger. They're troopers. Different branches. I don't have authority over them even though they're as green as a Super Mutant's backside.
joy|You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
sadness|I'm afraid you're not going to find much help here. We've got our hands full as it is.
sadness|I... Okay, it's Joana. She... works at Gomorrah. But it's all my fault! I met her at the Atomic Wrangler - beautiful doesn't even come close.
fear|I really hope you're not here to cause trouble.
neutral|Hurry up. The guards keep eyeing me like I'm a piece of meat.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
anger|I'm just getting warmed up! Hoo-ah!
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
anger|It is Caesar's wish that we hold this position. Our mere presence this side of the Colorado humiliates and demoralizes the enemy.
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
fear|I'm guessing it's because I'm outside of the heavy radiation areas. I'm not going outside to find out, though.
neutral|And now I know.
neutral|No. It doesn't.
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
surprise|Holy shit!
neutral|Thanks, that'll help.
neutral|Listeners have been unable to pick up radio broadcasts from Black Mountain recently. Most are calling the static, quote, a welcome improvement.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
neutral|Pretty hard to meet their crop quotas with twenty percent less water than we're supposed to be getting. Not that OSI cares about any of this.
sadness|Where did you go? Was it something I said?
fear|I think we got company.
joy|But it's understandable. The constant skirmishes take their toll on everyone in the end.
anger|If I hear one more loser moan about losing everything they own on the Strip, I may shoot him in the head.
joy|Saw a monster rip a man in half at The Thorn.
neutral|VStoryEventRemnants set to 3.
surprise|Holy shit! How the hell did you find that?
anger|What do you want now?
joy|Cool. Can I try?
fear|People all scared of those robots on the Strip since they changed. Like who needs the Strip anyway?
neutral|I'll have a security team sweep the area to see if the Legion has any more surprises for us.
joy|Baby, we're only the coolest cats on the whole Strip. We been here the longest, we got the swankiest digs, and we got caps rolling in like the tide.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
neutral|Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
neutral|I do odd jobs here and there, usually helping Sarah keep the Vault tidy. I came to New Vegas to be a professional gambler.
neutral|He's always been shady, but this is the first time he's outright screwed me.
fear|Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
neutral|Well let's get down to business. Once we get started, we're going to be on a tight schedule. Are you ready to do this?
anger|We will find you!
anger|No. It's too risky, we'll all end up dead.
sadness|Yeah, nice work destroying those guns, I'm gonna beat feet before they figure out I was involved.
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
surprise|Look, I appreciate the vote of confidence, but you don't know what it's like.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
neutral|Of course I am, you fool. I am a Centurion!
anger|Pin my medals upon my chest.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
sadness|What I really need is a book on psychology. Something for post-traumatic stress.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
anger|What was that for?
neutral|All right. Do you need anything to eat or drink?
surprise|Hello! The gasser everyone's been talking about, making a splash on the Strip. That's been you? Oh shit.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
anger|Bad Nightkin! You need to go see Marcus and Doctor Henry!
neutral|So I guess I'll stay. Won't be easy, but at least I won't feel guilty about the choice.
joy|That would help me, a lot!
neutral|Insiders are saying a key Legion prisoner has escaped Camp McCarran. The prisoner is armed and dangerous, and may be dressed as an NCR trooper.
surprise|I heard it got nasty at the Tops; wish I could've seen the shooting.
disgust|Better not try that again.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
surprise|Holy shit!
joy|I take care of those who help with that. Here, you earned it.
neutral|I can implant the Hypertrophy Accelerator for 4,000 caps. It will boost your adrenal glands and quickly increase your muscle mass.
neutral|Was the Courier male or female, and what kind of karma did the Courier have?
neutral|Good. I hoped you'd come around. Shall we?
fear|Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
sadness|The Tops is a real snooze fest. I hope they get some new shows soon.
anger|Still. It's not gonna stop the Legion. Might not even slow them down.
anger|As the bar!
disgust|Try robbing me, will you?
surprise|I still can't believe the King agreed to work with the NCR. But he's the King, and the King knows best.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
anger|If you meant what you said, you best be on your way, and at good speed. And forget all that I could have given you.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
joy|You can run, but you can't hide!
anger|Had enough?
sadness|Terrible thing, what happened to the Hostetlers.
joy|You've done a fine job, friend. Here is a little something for your work.
fear|I don't want to die!
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
neutral|I haven't been anywhere but here for... well, who the hell knows? If there's a corpse I haven't been babysitting it.
surprise|You hear about this courier doing shit around the Strip? Like what, delivering mail?
anger|I bet I'd get a reward for bringing your head to the authorities, assassin!
fear|The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
anger|If you don't need my help, that's fine with me.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
neutral|My goodness! I swear my heart skipped a beat!
joy|Lady Luck's on your side. I hope some of that rubs off on me, Caesar killer!
surprise|Well, now that you've sweet-talked me...
fear|After what happened to Mr. House, nobody knows for sure what's in play for the Strip.
joy|Much obliged to you, friend.
anger|What have you done?
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
neutral|Besides, I got into a little money trouble with the Omertas. If I quit the Crimson Caravan, how am I supposed to get the money to gamble?
joy|I'm not surprised Kimball survived. We NCR people are made of hard stuff.
surprise|What on earth is *that* creature?
surprise|Grenade!
anger|That's not a good idea.
neutral|Rumors persist about a Super Mutant refuge nestled high in a ski lodge to the Northwest.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
anger|Until now, every tribe I've conquered has been so backwards and stunted, enslavement has been a gift bestowed upon them.
anger|You belong on a cross, degenerate.
joy|Hi. How are you today?
anger|What's holding you up? Let's get this over with.
neutral|We'll have more news for you at the top of the hour.
neutral|Keep your heads down and move up to the next location.
disgust|I don't have time for this.
anger|That's not a good idea.
anger|Come on, ya bitch! You swing like a girl!
neutral|Yes, though at the time they called themselves the "Slither Kin." A vicious clan, not that that's changed, exactly.
anger|You're the one who suggested it.
fear|Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
neutral|This ain't "babysitting," stranger. I'm telling you, these people are nasty and Alice is in danger.
anger|I can't believe you've got the gall to stroll down the Strip after what you've done.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
surprise|Huh?
neutral|Excellent! Ezekiel's been after me to find him a new assistant for ages. Tell the boy we'll take him.
disgust|They want me to make an omelet, but I can't break any of their eggs, know what I'm saying?
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
surprise|I didn't know the Brotherhood had any people out here.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|The NCR's the biggest gang of thieves in the Mojave, only difference is they pass laws to make their crimes legal before they commit them.
surprise|Snake dead! Rats scurry while they can.
joy|Let Carlitos know that we'll be ready when you are.
sadness|Yeah... I always scare off the hot ones...
neutral|Forget it, I'm not gonna get my head blown off just because you don't know what you're doing!
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
anger|And I want a cute patron of this shit-hole to blow me over the pool-table, but that ain't happening either, is it?
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
sadness|If I don't get more water soon, I won't make my quota this season.
sadness|Major Polatli is putting everyone on double shifts to make up for recent losses to the Legion. That guy never gives up.
disgust|Did you really need that?
anger|Look, I know the NCR has problems, but I fought with those men. I'll be damned before I betray them.
joy|The east side gets lots of merchant and gambler traffic. We're safer here than in North Vegas or Westside, though we've got to put up with the NCR.
disgust|Murderer!
joy|You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
neutral|Detonate that reactor, and we can safely cross the Brotherhood off our list of concerns. Was there anything else?
neutral|That'll do, yeah.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
joy|The Lucky 38, all lit up in the distance? It's an inviting target.
anger|They killed her!
neutral|You're already the strongest person I've ever met. The implant won't do anything more for you.
sadness|Terrible thing, what happened to the Hostetlers.
joy|You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
surprise|Grenade!
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
sadness|Maybe when this is all over, they'll find time to look after us.
neutral|Finally, Mars has accepted my sacrifices and unleashes me.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
joy|Wish I could've seen you capture those beasts for our Thorn!
neutral|There's an honor to it. We're protecting people. Even if it's from themselves, it's a good cause.
neutral|The next time we speak, I expect you to have something for me.
neutral|Okay. But let's make sure and come back here. I'd love to wipe this place off the map.
joy|I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
joy|Want to see the best of New Vegas? Our sewers got it - The Thorn!
disgust|Murderer!
neutral|Huh. Just on your way to do a little heavily fortified sightseeing. Kind of a thrillseeker, aren't you?
neutral|Don't give us any trouble now.
surprise|If you had asked me a month ago, I'd have said we'd never willingly work with the NCR. But look at us now.
disgust|In a manner of speaking. Our envoy was brutally beaten, and only barely survived. My superiors ordered the relief mission scrapped.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
surprise|What about a vintage Vault-Tec toy car? Or-
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
joy|I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
fear|This isn't like the sims!
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
anger|Nobody screws with the Powder Gangers and lives!
neutral|I hear rumors they're poised to overrun the entire Colorado River Valley, and even the Army won't be enough to stop them.
anger|Don't need this right now.
surprise|My god!
sadness|I'm gonna miss having Anderson around.
fear|Oh. I've heard of you. What do you want?
joy|Report back when the camp is clear. I'll try and shuffle some men in that direction once the Legion is gone.
anger|What? A crappy... rat-hole!? My vault!? You are cruisin' for a bruisin', shuckster! The price stays.
joy|All I have to do is ride that mediocrity gradient to a cushy, do-nothing job miles away from the war.
neutral|Sources close to the Omertas tell us a newcomer has been meeting privately with bosses Nero and Big Sal, unusual for a Family outsider.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
fear|Okay, if you say so. Hell, it's not like we've got a lot to lose here.
disgust|I've been warned about you. You are perilously close to making an enemy of Caesar, and that is not wise.
fear|Okay, carry on. And, we've never been here, you understand? Boss doesn't need to know about this.
neutral|Thanks.
neutral|No worries. I'll hold onto those parts for you.
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
neutral|Bullshit. You're a goddamned coward, trying to pick the winning side.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
joy|That Caesar bastard had it coming.
neutral|Great Khans: Accepted.
anger|We don't like you Mojave scum, and we like you even less when you fuck with our Strip.
anger|That isn't yours!
sadness|Don't think I'll make it topside any time soon.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
neutral|Wasting my time is more like it.
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
surprise|Horns on the run. Voices wonder where they going?
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
neutral|We unlocked the secret of HELIOS One.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
sadness|Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
surprise|My god!
anger|I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
fear|So what are you going to do about it?
surprise|A single woman slaughters an entire camp of legionaries?! Oh, that's priceless!
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
anger|Come on!
neutral|Let me know if you change your mind.
joy|Give me a moment or two to catch my breath and knock back a few cocktails, and I'll swing by for a meet and greet.
anger|They killed him!
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
anger|Karl sends his regards.
anger|Look, trooper, I was living in this house long before your farms got set up. Don't even think about evicting me.
surprise|Really? Well... Ha! I don't even know what to say to that!
joy|I sent them to HELIOS One to see if they had any supplies they could spare. They've got to be somewhere between here and there.
neutral|Alright. What do you want to know?
surprise|Holy shit!
anger|I should make you pay for your crimes!
neutral|Today's headlines were brought to you by Primm. Primm. The other New Vegas.
anger|I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
fear|Do you think the Followers of the Apocalypse would take me? I remember all those books they brought us when they visited our tribe.
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
neutral|Whatever.
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
joy|This place smells like booze and sex. That's why I always come back.
disgust|Make it quick - I don't want to be seen with you.
disgust|Better not try that again.
sadness|Don't apologize. Their care is my responsibility, but everything I know came from an old first aid field manual.
anger|Give me cause, Profligate.
fear|You're not going to cause any problems, right?
joy|Holy shit! Did you hear that Caesar is dead? Maybe we actually have a fighting chance now.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
neutral|You need to make your way to this camp they have on the eastern bank and take out the Legate. That should hamstring this attack.
joy|Never get tired of hearing that.
surprise|I'm sure he's trying to sit out this battle, just as he did four years ago, hoping the Legion and Profligates will wipe each other out.
neutral|That's too bad. They're very rare. Well, I should be going. Nice talking to you.
anger|What was that for?
surprise|What was that?
anger|Fuck off.
anger|What the hell is your problem?
sadness|I... I guess you're right. I'll do the right thing and turn myself in.
joy|I'm usually here a few days out of the week.  Mostly to keep the fridge stocked.  Plus it's nice to get away from it all every now and then.
joy|Which do you like better -- the psionic beam or the laser?
neutral|Those are the risks of a hunter's life. I've delivered as promised, but perhaps I should better search for someone with greater resolve and honor?
neutral|BoS: Wild Child.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
neutral|We do need it, stranger. Still, I wish there was something we could give you in return.
joy|Good, let's not waste time then. Our biggest problems right now are supplies and troops, and the Legion is draining us of both.
anger|You're dead!
neutral|I have Blackfoot in me, the first tribe that Caesar ever led in battle - the tribe that formed the Legion.
joy|If I was a mortician, business would be booming. As a Doctor, business is hard. Too many injuries that I can't do anything about.
anger|Do that again and I'll put my foot so far up your ass you'll cough up boot polish!
fear|Holy shit! Run for your lives!
surprise|A free woman. It's... been awhile since I've seen a woman who wasn't a slave. I forget myself - are you injured?
neutral|We'll have a few hours before he arrives. You should look around and see if you can find anything that you can use.
fear|Brought too many bullets and not enough stimpaks!
anger|I've got the one at 11 o'clock! Razz, O'Hanrahan, take the two on the right! Poindexter, the center!
surprise|Heh. More than I could make in a week of shaking down these assholes anyways.
surprise|Yeah? That's ballsy. Good luck with that.
neutral|I think they'll probably end up killing you. I trained them myself. But, if you do win somehow, the mongrels will at least get honorable deaths.
anger|I'm afraid not. Our instructions were very specific. You have to die.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
joy|Fitting that the camp was taken care of in a way similar to Searchlight. Thank you for taking care of that place for us.
neutral|Fiend prisoners will fight for their lives against Night Stalkers.
anger|People drink, gamble, and fight. What do you think happens on the Strip? Any other intelligent questions?
surprise|Oh my, aren't you something else...!? I guess you'll have to see for yourself what I can do, huh?
sadness|Damn it, Orion. Why did you have to go and do something like that?
anger|What do you need?
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
neutral|The Codex is clear on this. It's-
neutral|The Bitter Springs refugee camp has been overrun by Legion slavers. Refugees should stay away, and avoid talking to strangers in football pads.
neutral|Wow, I wish I had more of them. All this interest. It'd be my biggest seller.
disgust|The Legion is torturing captive troopers in Nelson. I'd rather die fighting then be captured.
disgust|Sure thing, boss. You betcha.
disgust|You bastard!
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
joy|Won't have to worry about those Fiend assholes for some time now, huh?
neutral|But The Thorn honors balance, not foolish sacrifice. I'll only allow one Deathclaw against you.
surprise|I've heard about you.
joy|Good to have you around!
surprise|One day she turns up missing, and he hasn't said a word to me since.
joy|First base is do whatever Mr. House would've had you do. Finish rigging the game, then puzzle out how to take over where he left off, dig?
neutral|It isn't normally. The NCR wanted me to just gamble and listen, nothing else.
anger|As an anthropologist and linguist, my assignment was to learn the dialects of the Grand Canyon tribes. What a fucking waste of time!
neutral|That's how I made chief. It's how things were back then.
neutral|I wouldn't be able to meet the quota, and the NCR would kick me out of my job, anyway. Nah, it's better I get out on my own terms.
sadness|Terrible thing, what happened to the Hostetlers.
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
anger|They killed her!
joy|Howdy, pardner!
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
neutral|Well, welcome, then. I'm Veronica. I live in a hole in the ground.
joy|My man Jack at Red Rock Canyon got the goods. But listen: once you get folks dosed on Psycho, ain't a lot of room for much else.
sadness|Often I just don't have the resources to handle the number of injuries here.
sadness|Okay, I admit it, I ain't exactly rolling in caps here, but whaddya want? I'm under contract, I can't get out.
surprise|Hey, you're the one that's been hunting the most dangerous beasts for The Thorn!
joy|Then I can't help you. Sorry.
surprise|What on earth is *that* creature?
surprise|Word is those tough guys rangers are here. I ain't seen them myself, but how scary can they be?
neutral|Possibly immediate and permanent mental damage. There's a reason the Stealth Boy Mark IIs never got beyond the prototype stage.
neutral|No! Well, not really. I mean, I'm not listening through doors or sneaking around or anything. People talk out loud, and I just pay attention.
fear|This vault gives me the creeps.
joy|Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
joy|I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
neutral|I gambled and drank a lot after that. Got into trouble, but the Rangers gave me a second chance instead of kicking me out. So, here I am.
anger|We will find you!
neutral|Undoubtedly. Rangers are tough nuts to crack, though, and any force small enough to launch a surprise attack isn't going back in one piece.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
neutral|My family was ambushed by a pack of Legion raiders near Searchlight and Frank ran off, the gutless coward!
surprise|Oh shit... really? We should go take a look!
disgust|The salvage business has really slowed down since those ghouls took over REPCONN.
neutral|What?
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
anger|Look, jackass, the job's rough enough as it is without troublemakers like you, so either hand it all over or take your caps elsewhere.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
neutral|The Omertas are fanatically loyal to each other. Still, among any group, one can find the occasional degenerate.
disgust|I expect to be awed by your dizzying mercantile sense, boss.
joy|Okay, friend, I hope to see you again, far away from this place.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
disgust|Murderer!
neutral|Big brain on this one. All right, let's see... damn, heavy amounts of the chemicals used in the drug Turbo are present.
joy|Take care of yourself out there. And if you ever need a friendly hand, know that folks around here will always welcome you.
joy|Did you hear about the Legion Defeat at Nelson? We're winning back our territories.
sadness|Ages ago, long before I was born, we lived underground. Everyone had guns but the overseer wouldn't let us explode anything, not even a hand grenade.
neutral|Novac: Idolized.
anger|I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
fear|Sorry, I can't take that risk.
anger|Make it quick, I don't have time to stand around talking all day long.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
neutral|Innocent? Hardly.
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
surprise|What on earth is *that* creature?
anger|What on earth could push you to destroy Forlorn Hope?
joy|Report back if you pick up any intel or manage to sneak the bug into their radio.
sadness|Rainclouds wrap my heart in sorrow black as silk,
neutral|In New Vegas, we know the pain that numbers can bring us. Well, so does Guy Mitchell, who's got "Heartaches by the Number."
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
joy|The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
fear|Good gracious! The Legion is using the intake tunnels to storm their way into the dam, someone has to stop them.
joy|I heard you won Private Sexton's Legion killing contest. Nice job, that'll teach those Legion bastards!
anger|What is your major malfunction, maggot?
neutral|I wanted to be where the action is, so I got my dad to pull some strings and get me a cushy position with the Crimson Caravan.
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
neutral|Yes? Have you found them?
surprise|The robots here look different than others I've seen.
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
neutral|Something's wrong. Got a group coming our way. Looks like a Legion raiding party. It's big.
anger|You heard the man, people, get focused!
anger|You're the last person I expected to see here. This better be good.
sadness|Rest in peace, Brother.
anger|Whatever you've got to do, do it quick!
neutral|The army of bloodthirsty maniacs with you would disagree. No, I think I'll hold the fort here until our reinforcements arrive.
neutral|<Sighs> Goddamn it. It's like I'm being toyed with.
surprise|Great, just when you think the NCR can't possibly sink their claws deeper, the town of Primm signs up to join the Republic.
fear|Just, don't do anything crazy.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
joy|Never expected someone as famous as you to turn up here. What can I do for you?
joy|Fuse lit!
joy|All right, kid! I'm taking a liking to you. It's a deal.
fear|Uh... look, it's not what you think. I can explain everything, if you'll just hear me out.
neutral|Uh... you were kidding just now when you said that thing about the Codex, right?
neutral|And now Nat King Cole, reminding us what really matters with "Love Me As Though There Were No Tomorrow." Because in New Vegas, hey, you never know.
joy|There's my little buttercup. What can I do for you?
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
neutral|Zone clear! Advance to the next position.
neutral|Take care.
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
joy|Here I was thinking you'd be a challenge, want a rematch?
surprise|Word is the Khans signed a treaty with the NCR. Never saw that coming.
neutral|It's just a small outpost, but we keep busy. Raiding parties go out, new captures come in.
joy|Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
sadness|Go on then. Elevators are past the slot machines on your right.
anger|What the hell?!
neutral|Patrons of the Ultra-Luxe are questioning whether its pricey restaurant, the Gourmand, is overstating the fullness of its wait-list.
joy|You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
fear|Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
fear|We are so fucked here! How can we ever hope to fight off the entire Legion?
neutral|None of the guards have said we're free to go. As soon as we step out of here, we're just going to get caught again, or worse.
surprise|What the hell?Is that a half-robot dog?
joy|Heh. Yeah. That was some kind of stunt we pulled.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
surprise|Where'd he go?
neutral|While you were out, General Oliver arrived and briefed all senior officers regarding a change in our strategy.
neutral|Here's your NCR money. Will there be anything else?
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
anger|If anything goes down, you tell me first, you got that?
joy|Mr. House finally wised up and said he'd join the NCR in a year or something like that. Good news all around.
surprise|The robots here look different than others I've seen.
neutral|I'd heard fishermen spin old tales of 'Lakelurks' swimming in the water, but I always thought they were just bullshit mermaid stories.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
disgust|Murderer!
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
joy|I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
surprise|Whoa!
joy|We left and wandered the wastes. There were savages with knives. We blew them up with frag mines and grenades, burned them with flamethrowers.
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
fear|Look out!
joy|Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
surprise|Huh?
neutral|Tough shit. That's what I want, or I'm not going anywhere.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
sadness|Oh. Oh, I see. Well... thank you for saving her, at least.
neutral|People of Primm, the NCR wishes to inform you that you are under their jurisdiction now. And from now on, you're gonna be living by our rules.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
fear|We need more firepower!
neutral|Into the power station? How is that possible?
anger|That's not a good idea.
joy|Go see Yes Man. I made it so that cat can't help but be helpful.
surprise|Crowned heads lie dead. Bear heads growing strong.
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
anger|Damn!
surprise|Sure, but make them quick.
joy|There's always more next day.
disgust|So you're the bigshot that Caesar put in charge of this mission. Can't say I'm impressed, but let's just get down to business.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
fear|It can't be! How the hell...
neutral|I guess this is it. Not much air left now. Minutes, maybe. And this is what I have to show for it.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|You're an enemy of the Followers, as far as I'm concerned. I don't care how you've helped us.
disgust|Are you crazy? No way in hell am I going deeper into these caves.
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
neutral|I see no evidence of that. Nor do I see anyone out there with a solution to our problems.
neutral|Fat chance of that. What are you going to do if don't?
joy|Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
anger|No!
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
anger|The stealth field is unstable and scrambling things. This reading says gamma wave activity is zero, but that can't possibly be right.
joy|Great fighting today.
fear|Forlorn Hope was massacrated. How are the troops going to defend poor sobs like us?
sadness|My wife was taken from our home by Legion slavers one night while I was on watch.
neutral|VStoryEventBoomers set to 0.
joy|Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
joy|Make Vegas a town I woulda been proud of, baby. Let it swing.
neutral|Go on.
disgust|I bet it feels real nice to be carrying those weapons around on the strip.
fear|I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
disgust|Because Mr. House ripped this place to shreds before filling it with concrete. Hey, I was untouchable once, but Mr. House's a god - you got that?
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
surprise|Don't have all your coordination back yet, looks like. You should think about doing some rehab.
neutral|Some choice. I can't stay here now, and I don't have the means to leave.
sadness|Terrible thing, what happened to the Hostetlers.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
sadness|Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
neutral|Uh-huh. And how exactly was he exposed?
fear|Forlorn Hope was massacrated. How are the troops going to defend poor sobs like us?
fear|I ain't scared! I just don't like hurting folks, is all. Ma always used to tell me "boy, you're the biggest and the strongest, so you mind yourself!"
anger|Fighting was part of my studies.
neutral|Waiting in a hole for everyone else to die.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
sadness|Bitter Springs changed him, though. He started to really hate the NCR after the Massacre, and sometimes I worry that's poisoned his mind.
sadness|I wish I could look the other way, but I'm afraid my programming is very strict.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
neutral|I don't like the idea of buying supplies from our competition, but it's only temporary. We'll call in extra supplies from our distributors.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
neutral|Caesar's Legion continues to fortify its position in Nelson, where it remains a constant concern for Camp Forlorn Hope and the nearby town of Novac.
anger|Flank 'em!
neutral|That's all right.
neutral|You say so.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
anger|Beat it, or I'll call the bots on you right quick.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
neutral|VStoryEventBennyKilledCasino set to 1.
disgust|For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
neutral|Well to each their own I guess.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
neutral|Will you check out the caves and see if there's anything you can do?
joy|Howdy, come try your luck? I hope's on your side.
surprise|Found you!
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
surprise|Aha!
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
joy|I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
anger|How the hell did the monorail blow up? Someone's bringing back luck into the Strip, I tell you.
surprise|Honey, I've had better than just "good." And you were being so amusing...
neutral|You're right. I've been a mean son of a bitch the past couple years.
joy|You saved the NCR's head honcho, sure you can save a bunch of low-life scum like us.
fear|Change in plans?
anger|I don't think we got any more to discuss here.
joy|I hope the Fiends stop their raids now that their boss is gone
joy|Not at all - they're my best customers. As long as you don't try to sell 'em chems or alcohol, they treat you fair.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
joy|Hi there. I'm Old Lady Gibson, or so they tell me. I've got odds and ends for sale, and I'm pretty good at fixing things, too.
anger|We're through working together.
neutral|Though many NCR military officers fled the territory soon after the dam was lost, Chief Hanlon remained at Camp Golf to surrender to the Legion.
anger|It is not your armor, that power armor is property of the Brotherhood of Steel and you have no right to claim it as your own.
disgust|Are you talking to me?
neutral|What? There's no way... we're miles from the Colorado. They...they aren't even waiting for the Dam to fall. They're already inside the borders...
neutral|You've proven yourself, stranger. Your blood hungers for glory and I'll placate its thirst.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
joy|So much for Lem, you should have seen it, guts flying everywhere.
fear|Any word on Station Charlie?
joy|So, our President's savior is enjoying a well deserved R&R? Fine piece of work you are!
joy|Good job today. We got the President out safe and sound and I couldn't have done it without you. You have my thanks.
disgust|Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
anger|Stupid human!
disgust|I've heard about you. No funny stuff or I'll amputate your legs.
neutral|What's the name of your deathwish?
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
neutral|Thank you. Was there something else?
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
anger|What the hell?!
anger|That's mine!
anger|I'm not gonna stand for that!
surprise|It dedicated its citizens to something higher than themselves - to the idea of Rome itself.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
neutral|That expertise cultivates respect and gratitude. Spreads their ideals. Draws talent to their cause. They make friends like we make enemies.
joy|A ghoul goes to a doctor and he says "Doctor, Doctor, I have this horrible rash!" The Doctor says "Son, that's called your face."
surprise|Yeah, what do you want?
neutral|Unit, let's move out!
joy|Stories of how you saved President Kimball are the talk of the Strip, friend!
neutral|Caps it is. Will there be anything else?
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
joy|Heard there was a firefight in one of the big casinos. Maybe they'll need to buy more ammo now.
joy|Thanks a lot, doc. I think I should be able to walk out of here, now.
disgust|Creepy bunch of cats, you ask me. Oh, sure, they act all polite and civilized, but there's something off about them, you dig?
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
disgust|I hope so, kid. Last thing we need is that punk running around out there.
anger|I should make you pay for your crimes!
neutral|I said I didn't know about anything like that around here. But if he wanted to live for free, a lot of people do that in Freeside.
fear|How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
fear|You don't know Mr. Bishop. He's not like the other bosses up there. He knows the Wasteland like the back of his hand, and he likes to wander it.
joy|I take my wife everywhere, but somehow she keeps finding her way back.
joy|Sure, kid, see ya.
neutral|Certainly!
neutral|Check your weapons and move up!
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|Reyes got the numbers wrong - not much more to it than that.
joy|We should straighten those thugs at Gomorrah.
neutral|They moved us around a lot. I was stationed at Camp Golf for a while. Last I heard they were at Camp McCarran.
neutral|A bottle cap press is a whole other threat. We can't have anyone devaluing our currency by mass producing new bottle caps.
neutral|We've outlasted the end of the world. We'll outlast these upstarts.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
disgust|There was no decision. I was meant to pull that trigger. It was a mistake to think I could escape it.
joy|Take care of yourself out there. And if you ever need a friendly hand, know that folks around here will always welcome you.
anger|I'm not asking you to do this. I'm telling you.
surprise|House? More like House light. I heard he got himself unplugged.
anger|That's not funny.
anger|Damn!
neutral|They lick their wounds, and dream of righteous vengeance against New Vegas. Hello, embargo, farewell, tourist economy.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
joy|Hi!
joy|You got it. Anything else?
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
surprise|Aha!
joy|Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
anger|Months spent feeding the Omertas bribes, nursing their betrayal - all for nothing. Any other crimes?
sadness|Maybe you're right... but what will they think? How can I look them in the face ever again?
surprise|I didn't expect someone as famous as you to be here. Please tell me you're here to help.
anger|Are you mentally deranged?!
anger|Flank 'em!
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
neutral|Then there will be no safe haven for you.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
anger|We'll get 'em.
surprise|Grenade!
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|At the coolest, hippest, swinging-est joint on the Strip, that's where! The Tops, baby - don't miss it!
fear|Who are you? I didn't do anything, leave me alone.
neutral|It's not quite the same as making you luckier, but you'll be able to nudge things your way more often. I can do the implant for 4000 caps.
anger|You make one wrong move around here and I'll be all over you in a heartbeat. You hear me?
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
joy|All right! That's going to net you lots of caps, my friend. Do you want to trade all your vault suits right now?
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
anger|You again. What's your problem?
anger|Look out!
neutral|If you want to do some good, head up to Camp Forlorn Hope. I'll mark it on your map for you.
disgust|Stupid weak human.
anger|I'll need more than that. Keep looking.
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
neutral|On how many can you take?
disgust|Better not try that again.
anger|Even without our President, we won't leave the new territories!
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
neutral|Two plus two equaling four, Caesar wants you to destroy whatever you find in this bunker.
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
neutral|The east side gets lots of merchant and gambler traffic. We're safer here than in North Vegas or Westside, though we've got to put up with the NCR.
fear|Leave me alone!
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
joy|Now that you've killed that Caesar bastard, the Strip's really going to bloom!
joy|That's a true friend of this wonderful place! Lady Luck shines on you.
disgust|Don't think the shit you've pulled has been forgotten.
neutral|Keep your heads down and move up to the next location.
anger|No!
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
fear|Don't... do anything to me, okay?
anger|Hold the grenades for groups, squad! Hit them in clusters and send them running!
disgust|That's touching, but it would take away from our bottom line. I'll have to pass.
joy|Where did you get this? You know what, it doesn't even matter. It doesn't completely solve our problems, but it goes a long way.
fear|Uh-oh, I'll call the Securitrons if you try anything crazy with me, understand?
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
disgust|If you say you saw something, I'm sure it was there.
neutral|Like, hey  Fantastic, who gets to keep this doodad we found? Or, yo, Fantastic, when will you accept that you're the father of my child? It's crazy.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|Thanks.
neutral|Great Khans: Rascal.
surprise|Voices say waters close around bears *and* bull. Not sure who in better shape.
joy|No way I'm going back to prison.
sadness|Do they? Look at my Mother, all she cares for is a patch of bare dirt where nothing green will ever grow to feed us.
anger|All right, well, might want to get a move on, is all I'm saying.
fear|Uh, never mind. Take the supplies. All yours, friend.
neutral|Stay classy, New Vegas.
anger|We should've never come here.
surprise|Glad that fucker House is gone.
anger|No!
joy|<Laughs>Yeah. I'm with you there.
joy|They have a fantastic menu at the diner.
neutral|Once he was on the ground, all it took was a bit of choking and punching to finish him off.
fear|Look, just leave me alone. I'm not going outside.
fear|I'm just slave! I'm not worth it!
anger|You're an enemy of the Followers, as far as I'm concerned. I don't care how you've helped us.
joy|The crowd loves your bravery.
joy|Oh? Is that so, well I can't say that I'm sad to see that fucker gone.
surprise|Oh man! Awesome! The competition is still going strong. Keep it up!
anger|If we weren't in Khan territory I would kill you where you stand. Caesar will be avenged!
surprise|Grenade!
anger|The Legion happened. What the fuck's it look like?
joy|Thanks.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
anger|Well-spoken.
anger|Why am I even scared of Cachino and all those fuckers? Joana and I are dead anyway if we don't get the hell out of here.
joy|We used to have such parties in this diner! A bitch to clean later... but well worth it!
neutral|You can find it in the basement of the burned-out old building at the mouth of the canyon.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
anger|They killed her!
anger|They killed him!
neutral|Last time we clashed we lost a lot of people. Retreated to our bunker. Now we're afraid to even move around during the day.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
anger|It should've been me, not her... They will pay, right now! Out of my way!
surprise|The big showdown between the NCR and the Legion is coming soon, believe you me.
anger|Oh yeah? Fuck off, asshole.
anger|What, you think I can just waltz in there and take her away? She's their doll now, okay?
joy|Are you okay?
sadness|But look, I needed this. I needed to escape for just a little while. I needed this...
anger|Nothing I like better than a little R&R on Uncle Sam's dime.
surprise|The deadliest beast of all! You've never seen anything like this before.
anger|Shouldn't you be keeping an eye out for anything suspicious?
neutral|Might not happen overnight. Might take a few decades. But it'll happen. Basic human nature - greed, ambition, jealousy - will see to it.
neutral|No, they greatly prefer the sort of technology that puts people in hospitals. Or graves, rather, since hospitals went the way of the Dodo.
joy|You need a boyfriend, honey?
sadness|We'll miss Red Lucy down here.
neutral|What's your reputation with the Boomers?
joy|Hot damn do I love this place.
neutral|Can't believe we have patrol duty in the morning...
neutral|Indeed. Moving on...
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
joy|So baby, what did you find down there?
surprise|Huh?
surprise|Grenade!
joy|Nice work at the Tops buddy.
anger|People like you are the reason the Followers haven't brought civilization back to the wasteland yet.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
neutral|Here's your chip. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|Yeah, nothing strange about a late night stroll. Everybody does it.
neutral|Sad news from Goodsprings. The town was wiped out after heavy fighting with a gang of escaped convicts. Travelers are advised to keep their distance.
joy|The crowd loves your bravery.
anger|
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
neutral|All right, ladies, show's over.
surprise|Found you!
neutral|Coming up, I've got some tunes I think you all are gonna like.
neutral|We choose to stay, though I think we'll all debate you on the dying part.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
anger|I plan to roam the Wasteland once I'm ready. The people need light and kindness, there's too much fear and pain out there already.
neutral|Oh hell, no.  Working with our competition is not an option.
surprise|Veronica. I hope-
neutral|Give me my rifle and a clear line of sight and I'll start picking them off before they've even seen me.
anger|Alexander doesn't pay me to talk.
neutral|White made the mistake of assuming that because Anderson's a Follower of the Apocalypse, he wouldn't try anything.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
anger|It's quiet out here. We like to keep it that way.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
anger|That's not a good idea.
joy|Hey, It's great what you're doing for The Thorn, way to go!
surprise|Huh? What are you talking about?
neutral|The Thorn's a sacred ground, a source of awe. Here we truly rule over the forces of nature, for once.
anger|You'll pay for what you did to our soldiers at Forlorn Hope, murderer!
surprise|Huh? Look, man, me and Diane, we don't dig on that politics stuff, savvy? We just make the product and make it get to a good home.
joy|Throw some whiskey in the mix, and I'm game.
anger|No!
anger|Come back when you know more about the White Glove Society.
joy|Haven't found any Radroaches, so far.
surprise|Aha!
fear|Motor Runner dead? Who the fuck gonna run the show now?
anger|What the hell?!
joy|The new slave girls are quite beautiful.
anger|Grrrraah!
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
surprise|Weird, someone just told me that the Khans split the Vegas area. Wonder where they went, and why.
neutral|All right. I'll have him brought in for questioning.
sadness|That's a shame. Well if you change your mind, let me know. Need anything else?
neutral|Here you go. I promised you an extra reward for coming along, so that's what you get.
joy|I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
surprise|Aha!
surprise|Aha!
joy|Another satisfied customer.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
anger|No! Head voices don't talk to you. Only to me!
neutral|It was easy. The Colorado is narrow here, and when the Profligates abandoned Searchlight, there was no one to guard the crossing.
joy|Holy shit man, that's fucking crazy!
joy|This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
fear|Looks like Mr. House run out of luck, huh?
fear|You see a Ranger in black, run the other way. Take you out from a quarter mile off.
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
neutral|Well I knew he wouldn't listen to me. That's why we went out of our way to find something that he couldn't ignore.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
anger|The only stupid one we've had lately is Private Erwin. He's starting to cause me more trouble than he's worth.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
fear|Just, don't do anything crazy.
neutral|I suppose there's no point in remaining here any longer. Very well, my men and I will leave.
neutral|Not very friendly, are they?
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
anger|Oh boy, you've just made your last mistake.
anger|Flank 'em!
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
neutral|Was part of Super Mutant army, ran a town, walked the wasteland with a tribal. Now I'm here.
neutral|Don't you laugh at me. I know a spell that'll make you show your true form. Cave rat taught it to me.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
neutral|That'd make him pretty damn old, but I've met a few people in my travels who claimed they actually met him, and they weren't the lying type either.
neutral|By 2065 I deemed it a mathematical certainty that an atomic war would devastate the Earth within 15 years. Every projection I ran confirmed it.
neutral|Merchants are saying there's been little contact with traders from Nipton in recent days, causing concerns that the isolated town may be in trouble.
anger|Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
neutral|Cyber-dogs and the like. It's not a field I work in much anymore.
sadness|Maybe when this is all over, they'll find time to look after us.
surprise|Got any more of those? I wanna blow something up too!
anger|We'll get 'em.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
neutral|For now, come, we must see to the burning of the dead.
neutral|Him and the other Chairmen run the Tops. It's one of the nicer hotels, or so I hear.
joy|Do you have any medical experience?
disgust|So you want me to accompany you on your adventures across the wasteland, is that it?
neutral|He was a good spotter.
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
neutral|Hey, welcome to Red Rock Canyon! Since you've done so much for the Great Khans, Papa Khan told me to let you know you can buy weapons at our Armory.
fear|You're here for the money. I told the Omertas I was good for it! I just need more time!
anger|Still making a nuisance of yourself?
neutral|It's NCR land, for the most part. We tamed it, now we're settling it.
joy|NCR should head back to their lands, I'm sure *their* people miss them.
joy|I kinda like being a farmer.
surprise|Someone got Mr. House. The Strip's going to change, I'd bet on it.
anger|Come on, ya bum! Put your shoulder into it!
neutral|Was General Oliver's post, but I heard he's been up at the Dam a lot lately. Guessing Colonel Hsu is running it.
neutral|Citizens of Outer Vegas are flocking to the Strip in droves amid a wave of terror caused by a band of raiders known as the Fiends.
neutral|Anything that gets us out of here, please.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
anger|Until now, we've never had any hard evidence. Most of the chems end up with the Fiends, a group of crazies the NCR tangles with regularly.
anger|You didn't have any proof?
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
disgust|Murderer!
anger|Then leave me alone.
joy|Ha. Yeah, can you believe some people still eat that stuff? Anyway...
neutral|We've had some disturbing reports recently concerning the Omertas, one of the Three Families that run the Strip.
surprise|Aha!
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
anger|Time to die!
anger|Cooke organized the breakout. But he's just an overambitious prick who's going to get us all killed.
joy|So, what do you want to do with what you've got?
anger|Come on!
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
joy|Yeah, you made a pretty good argument. We'll keep it small for now, but if it turns a profit we might expand.
fear|Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
joy|That Caesar bastard had it coming.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
joy|We can finally relax with Cooke gone.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
anger|What did you just say?
surprise|You sound so sure. Damn it all, you better not make me regret this later.
surprise|They call it a Pip-Boy. I grew up in one of them vaults they made before the war. We all got one.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
joy|I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
neutral|A lot of the crops grown here support the various NCR camps in the region - McCarran, Golf, and Forlorn Hope, to name a few.
neutral|You can find it in the basement of the burned-out old building at the mouth of the canyon.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
anger|I'm not scared of you!
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
anger|I know, all right? And that's all you need to know.
anger|Flank 'em!
neutral|What's your reputation with the Brotherhood of Steel?
anger|Fighting was part of my studies.
sadness|At one point shortly after the last battle I had six of them spinning, was a wonderful sound. Only four of them are running right now.
disgust|Suit yourself.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
neutral|That's what the scope's for.
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
neutral|We did as the Codex dictated.
fear|Oh no!
joy|House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
neutral|For sale? I'm a slave, not a merchant. I could give you some supplies every day, though - you are, after all, a friend of the Legion.
neutral|I don't what it is about you, but I think you could actually pull it off. Deathclaws are tough bastards, but you might be even tougher.
joy|Even Presidents die, huh? Good.
neutral|My army will do what an army does best - defend territory from invaders... and maintain order.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
joy|Great! Don't be surprised if you're already last when you return. If I'm right, the troopers will use any excuse to slaughter Legion scum.
surprise|You'll leave me drier than tumbleweed, kid, but I reckon anything I can do to get back at Heck is well worth the expense.
anger|Have you looked around? Have you seen what's going on here? What we're going through?
neutral|Keep your damn voice down. Even though Lieutenant Hayes got himself killed recently, somebody else might be watching me.
fear|Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
surprise|Aha!
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
joy|NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
neutral|I make sure any dangers to the people of North Vegas stay outside our barriers, stranger. Day and night, I stand watch.
fear|I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
anger|The ground in Forlorn Hope was soaked red, from the blood of our own people!
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
joy|Going to place me a good bet at The Thorn.
neutral|Don't get killed out there.
anger|Had enough?
anger|Come on!
fear|Mostly ghouls, and a handful of radscorps. I think some geckos moved in not too long ago.
sadness|Terrible thing, what happened to the Hostetlers.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
anger|You're lucky we Followers tend to be forgiving.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
sadness|I... I was different back then.
surprise|You've beat Night Stalkers, right? We don't see that often down here.
disgust|Well, now, you didn't hear this from Tommy, but Benny likes to go off on a bender now and then.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
fear|I don't suppose you're feeling helpful today?
surprise|Found you!
joy|This is more than I could have hoped for! It almost seems too good to be true, but the details are all here.
fear|Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
disgust|Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
fear|House signing up with the NCR, you hear? Fucking sell-out.
anger|Nice try, wiseass. Now hand everything over before you make a *second* mistake.
surprise|Where'd he go?
sadness|Too bad I got this ironclad contract with the Garrets. They'll never let me out of it.
surprise|Same as you, I'd imagine? Although, I'm assigned to watch over these farms and keep out trespassers.
anger|Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
anger|Don't you know who I work for?
anger|Alright, that should do it. You need anything else?
anger|Come on!
neutral|I can't guarantee I'll be much help against their numbers, but I'll do what I can. Chances are we won't get out of here alive anyway.
joy|Okay!
joy|Radscorpion bites,
joy|Here I was thinking you'd be a challenge, want a rematch?
anger|There's more of them still out there.
anger|Now you pay!
sadness|You'll understand that now I have no choice but to employ deadly force.
neutral|Not if I kill you first!
anger|That's stealing!
neutral|I like the way you think.
anger|Had enough?
disgust|What!? I don't get paid near enough to what my talent deserves!? A 150 caps is my final offer.
surprise|I heard Mr. House's done for. I hope the Sewers don't turn for the worse.
fear|He's what? Ah jeez... jeez, this is really bad. What are you going to do?
anger|I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
surprise|What? Carlitos is alive? Please, tell him that I still love him, that I want to escape with him... please.
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
neutral|Not since the last time you asked, no.
surprise|People of my trade respect the merchants of these territories.
surprise|I've heard about you.
joy|Glad to help.
joy|Did you hear? Gomorrah's under new management!
neutral|No, but I know where he was going. He asked me if I knew of any place where he could hide out for a while.
anger|I think my Latin is better than yours. I inspect all the captives myself, and there was no "dentata."
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
anger|I'll have your blood, human!
neutral|Traders from California are being turned away at Mojave Outpost, where the NCR is concerned about dangers along Nipton Highway and I-15.
neutral|That's like saying Caesar and Kimball would listen to each other. Nightkin don't have a lot of trust for others, mutants included.
neutral|Okay, lead the way!
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
disgust|I swear to God that old man has thought of everything. Well, it looks like this was all for nothing, but you did your best. I appreciate the help.
neutral|I'll be honest. You're the first person I've run across out here that looks like he can really handle himself.
joy|Ah. I see. I suppose I can give you some medical supplies for your efforts. I assure you they will be worth plenty of caps.
neutral|Is there anything else I can help you with?
fear|Medicine's running low again.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
surprise|
anger|That's it! No one insults the eye!
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|It doesn't need to all come from the same source. There are a bunch of different vendors around who sell meat. Fitz, the Nash's, Crimson Caravan...
sadness|Chief! Why did you do it?
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
anger|People like you are the reason the Followers haven't brought civilization back to the wasteland yet.
neutral|Thanks, that'll help.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
neutral|Monorail's just ahead, boys, keep moving.
neutral|Tensions are brewing in Freeside between the ruling gang known as the Kings and the large number of NCR squatters seeking refuge there.
joy|Thanks for the help. I think the whole unit's doing a lot better now.
neutral|So, we know what they'll do and they know what we'll do, so we just sit around and keep an eye on each other.
neutral|Simple - an NCR Ranger named Grant is in charge of security arrangements for the visit. Present yourself to him, let him know you want to help.
neutral|Yeah, I guess not.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
disgust|I'd seen what had become of the NCR's attempts to emulate the culture of Pre-War America - the in-fighting, the corruption.
neutral|Lucius has been the head of my guard for five years now. He was a subordinate guard for eight before that.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
surprise|Wuh?
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|Have a seat. This will take awhile.
joy|As for what to expect, it's going to be the greatest battle - and victory - mankind has seen since it almost wiped itself off the face of this Earth.
neutral|I think you would really benefit from the Logic Co-Processor implant, so I'm going to cut the price to 3,000.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
joy|Here's your 5%, baby. You enjoy that.
joy|The best it's been since the camp started. All because of you. So thanks, buddy!
neutral|Well now... the armory could always use more firepower. Very well. Tell the Powder Gangers we accept their offer.
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
neutral|Their confusion allowed us to slaughter them like brahmin calves. Unfortunately, my brothers heading west did not fare as well.
surprise|What else, then?
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
neutral|I think your eyes will see more than I could ever tell you. Take your time. Enjoy the sights.
neutral|Take all the time you need, otherwise Lupa will tear your throat out.
anger|What the hell? No, get away from me, you goddamn TV on wheels!
neutral|I got a pressure in me like Hoover Dam.
sadness|The rest of my squad was crucified, butchered, mutilated. I don't know how they missed me. Maybe they didn't. Maybe they knew they'd broken me.
neutral|There's no getting around that, is there? What would my life be like here, knowing what's to come?
joy|Pussycat! Ain't this platinum? Had I known, I woulda baked a cake!
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
fear|Uh-oh, I'll call the Securitrons if you try anything crazy with me, understand?
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
fear|What is that thing? I've never seen a blue mutant.
neutral|Sure.
anger|Back at "Ranger School", they taught us not to run headlong into a battle when you're outnumbered ten to one.
disgust|If you want to be that way I'll leave you alone.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
neutral|Have half a mind to throw you all in a cell and let you sweat it off.
joy|Well, that's all she wrote.
neutral|Was a resort Pre-War. I renamed it to Jacobstown after an old friend. Died a long time ago.
joy|The cowboy act? Yeah, he dropped on in here not too long before you. He's got chops, baby, real chops, and I ain't just talking about that mustache.
surprise|Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
surprise|Boss, why do my pants suddenly feel lighter?
joy|Thanks. Prove you're reliable on this, and I'll have more for you later.
surprise|Huh?
neutral|Talk to Jack, he'd be happy to sell you some top-quality chems. He'll even give you a discount.
joy|Somebody whacked the NCR president. Got what was coming to him.
neutral|Well, I guess you're just too smart for me. Unfortunately, I can't leave any witnesses behind.
joy|The squad really seems to be working together better. It's nice, for a change.
surprise|I didn't know the Brotherhood had any people out here.
anger|I'll take you down with me!
disgust|Come back when you actually have the money, you damn junkie.
fear|Run! Beasts got free!
fear|The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
anger|Three doses? That's almost enough for a party.
joy|This is it, hunter. I've decided to grant you the opportunity to earn the greatest honor The Thorn could ever expect.
joy|There were tales once, of a cannibal tribe near Vegas, one that hid itself in a cavern far below ground, hunting men as prey above.
joy|Where are you?
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
neutral|Supposedly a prototype was being housed at Nellis. Imagine what it could do to the Brotherhood. We'd be on equal footing with any idiot with a gun.
joy|I'm the most interesting person I know.
neutral|I'll get there eventually. I've heard that you can't even get into the Strip unless you're rich.
anger|Now take the Platinum Chip, go down in that bunker or whatever it is, and destroy whatever gizmo-happy Brahmin shit you find. Now get to it. Vale.
disgust|Well then, get your ass out there.
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
neutral|I don't know sir. There was some talk of them entering through the clogged intake tunnels, but I don't have any confirmation.
joy|NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
neutral|Keeping watch, mostly. Trying to make sure the dangers of this plant are minimized.
neutral|Good. I won't hold you up any longer.
anger|She... I tracked her down. Southeast, near the river. They were selling her. Saw it through my scope.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|Listeners are not advised to follow that path in hopes of similar results.
joy|You can't hide from me.
joy|You saved the NCR's head honcho, sure you can save a bunch of low-life scum like us.
joy|That Legion boss would've never taken the city, but I'm glad he's a goner.
anger|Go away!
surprise|Look at that - a friendly Nightkin. What's it doing here?
surprise|Ghosts. Commie ghosts what don't know they're dead.
neutral|It was to have been delivered by courier the following afternoon... but by then, the world had ended.
disgust|Me and his wife, we didn't see eye-to-eye on some things. We had some pretty big arguments.
neutral|Sure you don't. All just a happy coincidence, am I right?
anger|You dirty coward!
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
neutral|It's a facility I built many years before you were born. You might think of it as a barracks. You'll understand soon enough.
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
sadness|You shouldn't tease me like that.
joy|If you should ever tire of wandering alone, seek us out. You might just have the makings of a Great Khan yourself.
neutral|Rex will be faster.
joy|My name is Karl. Glorious Caesar has sent me as an emissary to the Great Khans as a token of our alliance.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
surprise|Whoa!
fear|Don't get cocky, the Fiends are twitchy. Most of them won't bother a Khan, but the ones outside the Vault... well, they're outside for a reason.
anger|If you can't control it, keep it in your holster.
neutral|Careful in there - he's tougher than he looks.
joy|Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
joy|Mr. House won't trouble our plans for the Strip any longer, huh!?
joy|They'll recover soon and be back on the front lines in no time. Ahh... the circle of life.
anger|Come back when you're ready.
anger|I will have you hacked into pieces by my Praetorians - for my amusement. Understand?
neutral|I thought something was wrong. We usually have to pull them off any visitors to the Fort.
neutral|Good, good! Your growing number of NCR kills rivals most legionaries.
anger|Come on, end it!
neutral|Whatever happens from here on out, we killed that prick in the middle of his fortress.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
anger|Got no time for gawkers... or anyone looking for something I ain't selling.
disgust|Gathering junk's not the most exciting work, but it's a living.
neutral|You really don't know? I'm Samuel Cooke. I was the brains behind the NCRCF prison break.
neutral|Guess I'll get a fresh start and keep an eye out in case they leave the Fort.
anger|No!
anger|None of your business. You better keep your nose clean because I'll be watching you.
neutral|Fine, you'll receive a nice bonus when the work is done. And speaking of getting it done...
disgust|Well, if it isn't my number one fan. What can I do for you, number one fan?
anger|My wife's dead. I want the son of a bitch who sold her.
joy|Everybody loves the Chairmen, because we show them a simple good time, no strings attached.
neutral|Talk to Jack, he'd be happy to sell you some top-quality chems. He'll even give you a discount.
neutral|We've never really tried to go out and organize deals with merchants to supply our food. Already having an overstock of food, we haven't needed to.
disgust|It was heaven - until you find that all the glitter is made of broken dreams and all the praise hides a knife pointing at your ribs.
anger|Damnit! I can't believe the Legion actually got someone past our security. Good job catching him.
sadness|Sorry, little lady. I fixed up your head as best I knew how. Guess I missed a spot.
joy|We can finally relax with Cooke gone.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
neutral|Ta-ta.
surprise|Never seen a guardian dog like that before.
neutral|Whatever.
neutral|Just a little rest stop that me and my good friend Lupe set up. Last stop on your way into New Vegas, first stop on your way out, that's what I say.
neutral|You're human - they might be willing to be listen to what you have to say. Maybe.
neutral|Those last five shots were a bad idea...
disgust|It was heaven - until you find that all the glitter is made of broken dreams and all the praise hides a knife pointing at your ribs.
neutral|Profligate troops, Powder Gangers, men of the Legion such as myself - the people here didn't care. It was a town of whores.
joy|Buy you a drink, honey?
anger|I'm not scared of you!
joy|Another satisfied customer.
joy|Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
neutral|Kids. Run by sh- shumtimes.
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
surprise|What was that?
anger|The whole point of killing the geckos was so we could get at the sulfur and you've just made that a hell of a lot more difficult. Now fuck off.
neutral|NCR: Rascal.
neutral|The NCR can't touch us there - too many places for us to ambush them. We see their scouts poking around once in awhile, but they keep their distance.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
anger|Fine, here. Take it. Just leave me alone.
joy|It's showing improvement. Troopers aren't showing up late to their posts anymore.
joy|Wish I could've seen you capture those beasts for our Thorn!
joy|We need more people like you in the NCR.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
anger|Why you little promise-breaker! "Let me live, Benny, and I'll never come after you - pinky swear!" What a fink! Anyway...
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
surprise|The big showdown between the NCR and the Legion is coming soon, believe you me.
neutral|Those who claim to have dined at the restaurant find the food appealing but say many tables remain empty.
surprise|You don't know what you're asking. Just... let it go for now.
surprise|Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
surprise|That shot came from the Chief's office!
fear|Yeah, sure. Take your stuff back - you'll need it.
disgust|You might say I'm somewhere between a scout and an ambassador. I'm assigned here as part of the alliance between the Legion and the Great Khans.
joy|Good work. If you find any more, you know where to find me.
sadness|I can't believe someone killed President Kimball. He was such a nice guy, why would anyone want to hurt him?
surprise|How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
anger|Fine. Be like that.
neutral|Their very existence is a blight on the common good. Even worse are the Profligates, the subtype of Dissolute one finds this side of the river.
joy|You're all set. Are we done here?
anger|Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
sadness|Oh, of course! I'm sorry, I do tend to get wrapped up in my own theories and forget that not everyone finds them as fascinating as I do.
joy|A few years later, here we are - the best show in New Vegas!
anger|Make it quick.
sadness|Trying to grow crops in this heat, with so little water, is bad enough, but now we've got radiation seeping into the farmlands east of New Vegas.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
disgust|You'll pay for that!
anger|This battle is far from over. Once the reinforcements from McCarran arrive, the counteroffensive will begin.
anger|I'd kill you right now if I could.
anger|What do you want?
sadness|Like he helped the envoy we sent? No thanks.
anger|The plan is to get through today without the shit hitting the fan.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
neutral|There's a lot more troops here than we thought. No wonder we couldn't hold HELIOS One.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
joy|If you're looking for a good time, I'd suggest hitting up Gomorrah. The girls there are pretty nice, if you know what I mean.
disgust|Jesus, kid, I think we got a real problem on our hands. Can't believe Benny's a no-good stinkin' punk. Trying to play House like that....
surprise|I heard Mr. House's done for. I hope the Sewers don't turn for the worse.
neutral|Uhh, hey. Welcome to Red Rock Canyon. You've seemed a little bipolar lately - maybe you're having withdrawal symptoms?
neutral|Yes, they did. As will all the rest of them, in due time.
anger|It's because of that that we have sworn to take revenge on the NCR. With our new allies in Caesar's Legion, we will crush them!
anger|What was that for?
joy|Woof! If you're not the most sarcastic fella I ever met, your standards are so low they could use you at the Annual Gomorrah Saucy Limbo Competition.
anger|Not now, I'm busy.
joy|Sure, whatcha need?
neutral|All over the place. The easiest place to find them is unopened bottles of Sunset Sarsaparilla.
joy|Bless her. Seems like every traveler I get in here tells me the same thing.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
neutral|To hell with mercy killing. We're getting those guys out of there.
anger|No!
anger|You dirty coward!
anger|Ain't we covered this? The only thing not bad about them is they ain't Legion.
fear|People all scared of those robots on the Strip since they changed. Like who needs the Strip anyway?
neutral|Hey, welcome to Red Rock Canyon! Since you've done so much for the Great Khans, Papa Khan told me to let you know you can buy weapons at our Armory.
fear|This isn't like the sims!
joy|Please step into the open and identify yourself. Law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear.
surprise|Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
neutral|Yes, I am. I received my medical training at the Angel's Boneyard Medical University back in the NCR.
joy|But that don't mean them bullets didn't leave you nuttier than a Bighorner dropping.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
anger|Get out. I don't ever want to see you here again. And you stay the hell away from me.
surprise|Hey!
joy|You are about to be introduced to the U.S. army!
sadness|Can't help thinking that we've not seen the last of the Fiends yet.
neutral|It's said that the treasure is guarded by a man named Festus, and he's the one who asks for the blue-star caps.
neutral|He was our Elder when we came East. A wizard with technology, really. His mind just worked that way naturally. Learned a lot from him.
anger|I butchered this town. Those who weren't hacked limb from limb were forced to throw themselves from the cliffs. Three more, I have just crucified.
neutral|BoS: Rascal.
joy|Thanks again for this. You're platinum, baby.
anger|Come on!
fear|Oh no!
joy|When I get back home, I'll tell everyone I met you.
neutral|I'll get back to you on that in a moment. Once I've analyzed the results - uh, oh.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
neutral|Thanks, that'll help.
surprise|We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
neutral|Ooo. Very exciting. Gonna strike it rich, huh?
neutral|You speak the truth, stranger, and The Thorn lives by the justice that honor and strength dispense. Here's a more fitting sum.
anger|Beat it, or I'll call the bots on you right quick.
surprise|As you wish.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
neutral|We get the water - clean water - pumped in from Lake Mead. If you follow the big pipes, they'll take you all the way to the Lake.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
surprise|I heard you've killed Deathclaws at The Thorn. I couldn't believe it!
neutral|Enjoy your stay at The Tops.
joy|NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
surprise|You don't want anything in return? That's rare in these times, got to say.
fear|Forlorn Hope was massacrated. How are the troops going to defend poor sobs like us?
joy|Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
neutral|Dammit, I can take care of this by myself! That bitch is going to pay for all these years of bossing me around.
neutral|Bring on the mayhem, friend.
anger|Grrrraah!
surprise|I can't believe the King is dead. What's going to happen to us now?
neutral|If you want to do some good, head up to Camp Forlorn Hope. I'll mark it on your map for you.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
sadness|Maybe when this is all over, they'll find time to look after us.
neutral|Oh, I don't know about that. Lots of folks travel by on their way to New Vegas.
neutral|Whoops, better put on my newsman fedora, here.
anger|I wouldn't.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
neutral|Most humans can't tell the difference between mutants. Might come here looking for payback.
joy|We owe you so much for saving our President.
anger|We'll get 'em.
joy|That Caesar bastard had it coming.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|Not to say that all women are equally incapable. I trust Caesar will find a worthy use for you.
neutral|That would make for a welcome change.
fear|For my customers, I mean... I'm not into that kind of shit.
neutral|A rare fight, Deathclaw against Fire Geckos.
surprise|The Great Khans tribe went mad. During the battle at the Dam, they attacked both the Legion and the NCR.
surprise|Aha!
disgust|If he's a ghoul he should be put down. I can't let a rabid dog suffer.
neutral|Aggressive acts against us will earn you a place on a cross. Turn back now, or pay the consequences.
joy|Good to have you around!
fear|Bleeding out pretty bad here!
anger|Damn!
disgust|The salvage business has really slowed down since those ghouls took over REPCONN.
neutral|You've done some great work for us up to this point, and we are hoping to use your unique abilities to aid us once again.
surprise|Aha!
anger|Flank 'em!
anger|Get your own!
sadness|Thanks for finding these. You should check in with the Major, he'll want to know about this.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
surprise|What the hell?Is that a half-robot dog?
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
anger|They killed him!
neutral|At least he's too much of a coward to come after us himself. What if he'd ended up in this pen with us?
fear|How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
neutral|Now go, and teach them what you learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
surprise|Aha!
neutral|Ranger Station Alpha used to be the frontline outpost for NCR. When we moved onto the Dam, this station has fallen into more a support role.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
neutral|Suggestions, eh? I'd suggest you play to your strengths. There's probably plenty of ways to kill Kimball, just find one that works best for you.
joy|Diane's my girl, man. We've been taking care of each other our whole lives, ever since our folks died. Now we keep the Khans in caps together.
joy|Pleasure doing business with you.
surprise|If you had asked me a month ago, I'd have said we'd never willingly work with the NCR. But look at us now.
joy|Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
neutral|All right, let McCarran know they should expect the first shipment in a week or so.
anger|The NCR's no better. They won't burn your home and rape your daughter, sure, but they'll steal your wealth all the same... when you ain't looking.
joy|House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
joy|We're waiting on you.  A lot of us are interested in joining the Khans.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
surprise|Worried? Do I look worried to you? I've got this under control, baby. No one else can do what I do here.
fear|Shiny screens brighter! Don't let them flicker at us!
disgust|Couldn't even hide from a half-blind old ghoul. How embarassing for you.
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
joy|These guys in Freeside, good shots, right? They owe me big time. Tell'em that Carlitos' back to collect his chips, they'll know what do.
fear|The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
joy|You saved the NCR's head honcho, sure you can save a bunch of low-life scum like us.
anger|Yes it will. If we feed people, they'll support us. They'll join us.
fear|Oh no!
surprise|I heard some Squatters talking about some fancy pants Rangers coming into the area soon. Like we need more NCR here.
neutral|With their commander dead, the NCR will pull out of this region, allowing our conquest to continue westward unopposed for a time.
surprise|A bomb on the President's vertibird? Only a limited number of people had access to the vertibird.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|It's a pleasure to see you, friend! Best of luck during your stay.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
neutral|Adios.
joy|whose sister she did love to bare it.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
neutral|It's a fucking deathtrap around here. Fiends swarm all over Vault 3 in the east, and there are fucking Deathclaws south of that, at Quarry Junction.
joy|I know a guy, his motto is Love Thy Neighbor. He lives next door to a brothel.
sadness|This won't defeat our enemies.
joy|House all dead, we should hit the Strip. Rip shit up.
neutral|Take it.
joy|I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
sadness|Oh, okay.
neutral|To arms, my brothers!
anger|I think you'd better leave.
neutral|I'm close to the cure, I can feel it. Lily's continued help will give me the last bit of data that I need.
joy|That Fiend leader got what he fucking deserved.
anger|Grrrraah!
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
joy|That is one battered Eyebot. It's a miracle it's still functioning.
neutral|She's my daughter. Takes a little too much after her mother, rest her soul, but she's happy with the Great Khans, and that's enough for me.
joy|I've been placed in charge of morale. It's difficult trying to keep spirits up with the Legion nearby.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
surprise|The tables turned for Mr. House. What next, huh?
joy|Until next time.
sadness|I hope nothing happens on my watch. I'm too damn tired to fight back right now.
surprise|To be free and with Carlitos again... Tell him that I still, I - never mind.
joy|Doubtless they ran away in sheer terror of the mighty Raul! Oh, and you too, boss.
neutral|Zone clear! Advance to the next position.
anger|If that's all you came here to talk about, you're wasting my time. Get to the point, or get out of my office.
joy|I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
disgust|If you have to. I really don't see what there is to consider.
fear|Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.
neutral|What I heard, he'd be a general right now if Oliver didn't know the president.
surprise|Did those bullets scramble your egg? Or have you always been a naughty broad...?
anger|Even without our President, we won't leave the new territories!
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
disgust|Man, the brass is going to be thrilled that you're here.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
joy|See, I'm using insults to promote the act. That was my idea!
joy|Feel better? You should, that was the good stuff. Need anything else?
fear|Bears hurt.
neutral|What am I supposed to do? I've got no money left, and now my family has abandoned me.
neutral|Let's go up there first, huh?
joy|Yep. Been waiting for a chance to use it. So can I count you in?
joy|I hear you defeated the Legion forces at Nelson. I'm impressed, and thankful. It'll make my job around here much easier.
surprise|Stop right there!... I'm sorry, but there's nothing wrong with my brain. What I need is something that inspires ideas back into my work.
fear|How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
neutral|Things are going to get harder for the Brotherhood before they get easier. I should support them in whatever way I can.
surprise|What do you mean, helpful? My stuff already makes people feel groodalicious.
disgust|Whatever.
anger|
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
neutral|What have you done?
surprise|Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
joy|Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
disgust|Murderer!
neutral|What? How? What happened?
surprise|Hell of a battle at Nelson. I'm impressed our troops survived.
anger|You think I'm going to slit my throat for some megalomaniacal self-appointed dictator?
joy|If you had a few dozen doses of Psycho on you, maybe we could pep these weepy troopers into charging down into Nelson and taking back the camp.
disgust|Murderer!
anger|What the hell?!
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
joy|That was fun. Did you see the look on that bitch's face? Priceless.
joy|The Legion has won a great victory over the NCR at a place called Forlorn Hope.
neutral|No, I'm not going to bring it up.
disgust|Greed runs rampant. The government is corrupt, accepting bribes from Brahmin barons and landowners, to the detriment of citizens.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
neutral|Well, fuck. I can't believe I'm going back to Red Rock empty-handed. Thanks for trying to help.
surprise|Well, if you ask me, what we really need is to get the whole squad out on the practice range - shape up our marksmanship and explosives skill.
anger|Now are you here for something or are you just wasting my time?
joy|At this rate, one Securitron is going to be enough to defend the whole Strip.
anger|I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
anger|Look out!
joy|Military men, NCR ranchers, wandering travelers... they're all the same without their clothes on. What they want, the Omertas provide.
neutral|I don't think that's the whole story, but fuck it. I'm going back to Red Rock. I've had enough of this place.
surprise|I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
surprise|We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
neutral|Yes?
anger|Grrrraah!
fear|Stop it! Help!
anger|I bet I'd get a reward for bringing your head to the authorities, assassin!
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
neutral|Bring me a dozen Giant Mantis' eggs. If you accomplish this, I might gift you with greater tasks in the future.
neutral|If you find my friends, please return their dogtags to the NCR. People need to know what happened here.
joy|Another satisfied customer.
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
disgust|Murderer!
joy|Thanks to your help, I think Bitter Springs has a real shot at surviving. Thank you again.
surprise|Usually he's only gone a couple days, but this last time nobody saw him for almost a month!
joy|You get it? Legion ear?
neutral|Uhh, hey. Welcome to Red Rock Canyon. You've seemed a little bipolar lately - maybe you're having withdrawal symptoms?
disgust|What? Why on earth would you think you can walk in here and make troop deployment recommendations to me?
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
anger|Yeah, well... I didn't want to get promoted out of the field. I didn't join up to drive a desk.
surprise|Fiends don't come here no more, they say.
sadness|Don't get lost! My vault has many corridors and rooms - although it is no longer symmetrical, after Mr. House threw us out.
joy|Here I was thinking you'd be a challenge, want a rematch?
anger|Come on!
neutral|I'm also canceling the President's speech. We'll have a security team get him out of here right away. But let's not relax until he's safe.
disgust|You don't seem to take a hint. Get out of my face.
joy|Won't have to worry about those Fiend assholes for some time now, huh?
anger|Go on then. Elevators are past the slot machines on your right.
neutral|VStoryEventRacket set to 1.
neutral|Good. We clear out the hostages and they lose their advantage. They're down in a clearing, crucified on some telephone poles.
sadness|I wish the rest of the Vault were accessible.
anger|What right do they have to continue with their mischief and killing, huh?
joy|It's amazing that Kimball managed to survive.
joy|Lem's been taken care of. We can start mining that sulfur now, thanks to you.
surprise|NCR is going to be rip shit about losing their little train.
neutral|What's your reputation with the NCR?
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
neutral|But you're not going to do that. You're going to do the smart thing, and work for me.
anger|All right. I'll let it go - this time.
neutral|You've earned the honor of being part of this sacred ground. Come to me often and I'll share with you the wealth of The Thorn.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
neutral|It is different! Right now I'm trying very hard to remain civil, and you're not making it easy with your incessant questions!
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
joy|But, in the end, I was tough enough to be made a member. Proudest day of my life.
anger|What the hell are you looking at, punk?
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
disgust|Maybe that's how you was raised, but where I come from a man does right by his wife and child or he ain't no kinda man at all.
neutral|Nah, they'd probably catch it if I rewrote the Founder's axioms.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
neutral|Do you have good news for The Thorn?
neutral|That we do, baby, that we do...
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
neutral|Well, you know what that means, folks. Time for some news.
surprise|What in the goddamn...?
neutral|Bye.
anger|I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
neutral|Great Khans: Idolized.
joy|And a quick shot... all done.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
neutral|He was presented with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
joy|Mr. House finally wised up and said he'd join the NCR in a year or something like that. Good news all around.
anger|Flank 'em!
sadness|Oh, why do nice girls hate me?
neutral|Whatever.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
neutral|Ha! If only it was this easy all the time.
neutral|Ladies, please remove yourselves from the fountain.
anger|Had enough?
neutral|All right, power on the Stealth Boy, Lily.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
anger|Stealing isn't very nice, is it Leo?
neutral|I'd heard fishermen spin old tales of 'Lakelurks' swimming in the water, but I always thought they were just bullshit mermaid stories.
neutral|And how exactly would you do that?
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
neutral|The fighting in the power plant is the fiercest, as expected. But the dogs have been caught off guard, and their positions can expect no support.
neutral|Sure.
anger|Nobody messes with the Kings.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
neutral|Uh, yeah, sure. H-here you go. Just don't hurt me.
neutral|The Jamisons are very wealthy ranchers back in Redding, California and significant investors in the Crimson Caravan Company.
neutral|Going to have words with your commanding officer after this.
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
disgust|Keep deluding yourself if you want. I've seen the NCR's true face.
neutral|Move up to the next position.
anger|Watch yourself, we got hit by a Legion raiding party just the other night.
fear|I'm ready for you... Hey, guys, need a hand here!
joy|Welcome back. What can I do for you this time?
anger|I saw you take that!
surprise|Aha!
neutral|No. I only would've needed one bullet to do things right that day.
anger|So you keep saying.
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
anger|What do you need?
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|It's a pleasure to see you, friend! Best of luck during your stay.
surprise|Everyone's talking about Hoover Dam nowadays. I wish the battle would just happen already. The suspense is killing me.
anger|Don't care about Kimball, until he starts to care about us.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
joy|Now that they're gone, we'll be able to prepare for the upcoming conflict at Hoover Dam.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
joy|House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
surprise|You've been making a name for yourself around here already.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
anger|Today's a hell of day to die, commie!
joy|Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
neutral|We've been through this.
joy|Doctor's bags would be a huge help, but what I really need are medical texts.
surprise|Wish I could've seen what's inside the 38.
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
anger|Someone's looking to cash their chips early.
joy|And like we agreed, here's your fee. 5% of the cut comes to 166 caps. Don't spend them all in one place now - unless it's right here!
joy|Well, well! If it isn't the Vault explorer herself! Welcome back.
anger|Good. Oh, one more thing: Caesar's representative, Karl, has become fast friends with Papa. Karl's the one who has him so fixated on this alliance.
neutral|Great Khans: Vilified.
neutral|A fair question, and one I've had our strategists think about for some time. Their consensus is that we must focus on the one thing we can count on.
neutral|Dammit! Okay, well, thank you for finding out at least. Was there something else you needed?
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
anger|Not fair! Haven't killed you yet!
joy|You want to gamble with class? Hit the Ultra-Luxe, if you don't mind being serviced by masked creeps.
neutral|FREEDOM!
fear|You know, I appreciate the help but... we'll pass on those. Thanks.
surprise|Aha!
anger|That may be the case, but I can't risk that kind of cash-flow. You'll have to do better than that.
neutral|The Crimson Caravan doesn't have any branches out that way, so it'll be up to me get to things started.
anger|The ground in Forlorn Hope was soaked red, from the blood of our own people!
surprise|Found you!
neutral|Want to dance, hit Gomorrah.
surprise|Maybe you could find something he wrote that expresses that opinion, or trick him into losing his cool in the longhouse right in front of Papa.
neutral|No deal. You and four of my dogs. Not two, not three - four.
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
joy|Right on. What have you got?
fear|What did I do wrong?
neutral|Check your weapons and move up!
joy|Fine. Are you ready?
joy|You want to gamble with class? Hit the Ultra-Luxe, if you don't mind being serviced by masked creeps.
anger|Stay out of trouble, we have enough problems here as it is.
surprise|Holy shit!
neutral|It was worth keeping from our enemies. If they had it-
fear|Get away! Get away!
anger|Five doses? Nice. A fella could put himself out of his misery with five doses.
anger|What have you done?
neutral|A fair price. Always best to have caps on hand in case traders stop by.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
joy|Hey, maybe I can change your mind. I still have some drugs left over. They're all yours if you let me go.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
surprise|Aha!
anger|Damn!
joy|That was a fine bit of work back there. Truth told, I'm surprised you made it out of there in one piece. You and the Dam.
sadness|Yeah, not many people have. Wasn't really a good place for kids, you know? I joined up to get out. My family's still back there.
joy|Ow, ow, ow, ow... ow.
neutral|Reports indicate that NCR forces emerged victorious, and the Legion scattered amidst the defeat of its most feared military leader.
disgust|Guess it's leftovers for me.
neutral|Very Well. You may proceed. However, be warned. Aggressive acts will earn you a place on a cross.
surprise|Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
anger|Be warned, The Thorn demands respect. Break the rules, or offend me in any way, and I'll gut you open for all to see.
surprise|Huh?
sadness|Every day she told me that. Guess I done took it to heart.
sadness|Major Polatli is putting everyone on double shifts to make up for recent losses to the Legion. That guy never gives up.
disgust|For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
sadness|Because fair is fair.
anger|Damn it!
anger|Bad? I've been doing this a long time and I haven't been in many places that were worse than this.
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
neutral|Right now we mostly let him operate the switchboard for the intercom. Flipping switches seems to keep him pretty happy.
neutral|Forget it, it's done.
fear|Wish they'd show themselves.
anger|I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
neutral|Bye.
joy|A Follower is always welcome among our people.
joy|Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
neutral|I'll be in the crowd. Do whatever you need to do, then find me before Kimball arrives.
anger|My buddies at McCarran will find the asshole that destroyed our Monorail.
joy|We solved any quarrels through gambling! Lady luck casts no eyeballs, you know? So, nobody shafted anyone else!
neutral|Well, you'll probably be fine. For a little while, anyway.
sadness|Lower than a Feral Ghoul's IQ.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
surprise|Aha!
neutral|So long, stranger.
surprise|Whoa!
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|You're lucky we Followers tend to be forgiving.
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
joy|
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
anger|We don't like you Mojave scum, and we like you even less when you fuck with our Strip.
joy|My duties tend to take me elsewhere, but I try to be here at least a few days out of the week.
fear|Well... There's been reports of trouble south, but me and Michelle can handle ourselves. And there's plenty of soldiers about, so that helps.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
neutral|I swear the monorail was *just* ahead... somewhere.
neutral|He added he didn't want to see the NCR in the ghetto, and called for a mass, quote, return to sender.
anger|Warlords and emperors? Don't make me laugh. At least they got enough brains to stay the hell out of New Vegas - Mr. House'd clean their clocks.
anger|I told you I wouldn't work against the NCR. I meant it.
joy|Got it. I'll be way back here, boss.
neutral|You're no friend to the Great Khans. You should turn around and leave - and if we see you in the Mojave, well... accidents happen.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
sadness|Now... I just want to get back home. I've had enough fighting and fixing up soldiers just to send them right back out to die to last a lifetime.
anger|They killed him!
neutral|Vale.
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
anger|Let's start this dance.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
surprise|Hey!
anger|Restore contact with the enemy, goddammit!
anger|Head voices don't *like* you, squishy man!
neutral|That temper of yours? Kinda why this conversation's taking place over an intercom.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
anger|You're lucky we Followers tend to be forgiving.
joy|Good riddance, Caesar! We can finally enjoy some R&R without worrying about a Legion attack at McCarran.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
neutral|VStoryEventNelson set to 2.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
joy|And a quick shot... all done.
neutral|Honestas, Industria, Prudentia - even the virtues of slaves are beyond the Dissolute on this side of the river.
joy|Lady Luck smiled on our President.
anger|I'll kill you!
neutral|VStoryEventRemnants set to 2.
neutral|If that's not lucky, what is?
neutral|They're based out of the old fort in Freeside. They supposedly helped the NCR out at some point, but they go their own way now.
neutral|Watch yourself with this.
anger|Worst of the worst! A tribe of degenerate losers led by a creep. They crucify people for kicks! Slaughter whole towns!
anger|I tell you, something stinks about this Monorail attack!
anger|They killed him!
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
disgust|I suppose I'm going to have to do something about that.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
neutral|One of the families that runs the Strip. They're a pack of cheaters, but you still don't want to fuck with them.
neutral|Looks like we got them, move fast and look alive.
anger|They killed him!
joy|So, our President's savior is enjoying a well deserved R&R? Fine piece of work you are!
neutral|I won't lie to you. It'll be dangerous.
disgust|Only in light of the extraordinary service you've rendered unto me am I going to overlook this failure.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
anger|I'm a little ashamed to admit it, but a part of me would really love to get my hands on the bitch that killed the President.
joy|You got a crazy drop on me, baby, but you don't want to kill me. It's like I said, we should be working together.
disgust|Your pet ghoul smells like ass.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
surprise|You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
joy|They're called bodyguards, and every one of them is packing. Me, too - so baby makes five.
neutral|All right, this will only take a few minutes.
neutral|With the Khans, the only difference between a soldier and a civilian is that the civilian is more likely to miss when he shoots at you.
neutral|An NCR private scheduled to receive an award exploded as he reached the stage, killing the president in the blast.
surprise|Thorn... *pulled* from flesh of bull? Not sure why.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
anger|Flank 'em!
surprise|Whoa!
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
sadness|During that time I saw quite a few things I wouldn't mind forgetting about.
fear|This can't be happening!
anger|Hey Buddy, Zoara is off limits to everyone but Family.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
sadness|I'll never see my kids grow up, but they're better off without me.
neutral|Benny's at the Fort. What happened next?
neutral|High Elder Maxson didn't just found the Brotherhood. He defined it. To serve in the Brotherhood is to serve his ideals.
neutral|Wish there was more of them. I wasn't done yet.
neutral|Giant Radscorpions are about to battle in The Thorn.
surprise|You up for something challenging?
joy|Man, I love my guns.
fear|Holy shit! Run for your lives!
sadness|I'm gonna miss having Anderson around.
neutral|All right, then!
neutral|Sure, he's one of the hotel managers on the Strip. He comes up in the news now and then.
joy|Good, we're going to the Police Station first. Here's the key, we'll follow you there.
joy|Ave, amicus.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
neutral|And God help us if they lose.
neutral|But do I ever do that? Is his name Fantastic?
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
neutral|Odds are they were Vault dwellers. That's everything I know about them, really.
surprise|How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
surprise|Sun sets.
joy|This place smells like booze and sex. That's why I always come back.
surprise|What in the goddamn...?
joy|Ahh... look who it is. What brings someone of your renown into my humble medical center?
disgust|Don't listen to a word No-bark says. I don't think he ever sleeps, so it's no wonder he spouts nothing but nonsense.
neutral|My pleasure. Thanks again.
disgust|And how would you propose accomplishing such a goal?
anger|I thought this was supposed to hurt!
disgust|Typical. No reverence for history in the younger generations.
surprise|Hey!
anger|Listen, we own these lands, and I'll be damned if the NCR, those Legion bastards, or anyone else tries to walk all over us.
surprise|I've never seen so many pretty lights in my life.
anger|If this isn't a crisis situation, you'd better have a damn good reason for interrupting me.
joy|The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
anger|What do you want now?
neutral|You can do what you want, but I'm not going anywhere.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
anger|Ok little lady, let's get started. You look like a tough piece of meat, I'm going to enjoy tenderizing you.
surprise|Great, just when you think the NCR can't possibly sink their claws deeper, the town of Primm signs up to join the Republic.
anger|I'm pretty sure you're not authorized to be here, whatever unit you happen to be from. What do you want?
neutral|Or I can stay here with the people I care about and do... whatever I can, until it comes to a slow or sudden end.
joy|Won't have to worry about those Fiend assholes for some time now, huh?
surprise|Never seen a guardian dog like that before.
surprise|Hey!
disgust|Better not try that again.
sadness|Can you spare some caps, 'mam?
neutral|Yes, they did. As will all the rest of you, in due time.
disgust|Better not try that again.
neutral|We've worked day and night, for months, to make that much. This is all we can give.
joy|Great. Come back as soon as you can.
disgust|Such an attempt, however, is likely to thwart efforts to motivate the squad to do actual work. If such is your goal, you should look elsewhere.
neutral|Why do they call it a monorail... it's a train. A *train.*
joy|For hows and whats, just talk to Yes Man. I made it so that cat can't help but be helpful.
anger|You know what? I think it's best if he stays with me.
neutral|In the past, the NCR has relied upon attrition, withering our numbers with ranged fire and falling back as necessary.
joy|Want a massage, cutie? No charge.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
anger|Good idea.
anger|Just keep on walking.
joy|That was a good day for The Thorn.
disgust|The simple fact that I no longer have as many supplies as I should. I've been careful with them and I should have more than what remains.
joy|Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
joy|I heard you talking to Horowitz, and can't thank you enough for what you've done for us.
joy|I can't imagine this place will ever disappear.
sadness|Another day, another battle, another dead trooper. When is this shit going to end?
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
joy|Any other juicy bits of intel?
surprise|Aha!
surprise|Hey. I thought some more about what you said. I think maybe you're right. Maybe I should go to Bitter Springs.
sadness|The squad leader's got some promise, kid named Mags, but as for the rest... I don't see much hope.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
anger|Locked and loaded!
joy|I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
surprise|Where'd he go?
joy|That was something else. I look forward to the next ride - once I recover, you monster.
neutral|We need to engage the outside world. We can't win without new recruits.
anger|Come on!
neutral|Whatever. You know where to find me.
surprise|We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
neutral|Like raiders, but worse - these guys are messed up on every damn chem there is. You can spot them by the horned skulls they wear as hats.
surprise|You're new, aren't you? What can I do for you?
neutral|VStoryEventKimballAssassination set to 0.
anger|Serving up some hurt.
neutral|Help? No, look, I apprec... You know, what, yes, I could use the help. And you look like you can handle yourself.
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
anger|I'd kill you right now if I could.
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
anger|Go away! Go away!
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
anger|There's nothing I like better than the smell of plasma in the morning!
neutral|Great. Thanks. Thank you. I'll encourage people to name their non-ugly children after you. Seriously.
anger|They killed her!
anger|A magician don't explain his tricks. I get it.
neutral|Whatever.
neutral|Check your weapons and move up!
anger|Come on!
anger|Their "republic" is a joke. They're a bunch of tyrants led by an even greater tyrant, that idiot Kimball.
surprise|Mars growing bigger. Shadow gets larger.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
surprise|Hey!
neutral|We see eye to eye, we speak warrior to warrior... And I thought myself too old to find an equal, Ha!
anger|Fighting was part of my studies.
anger|Here he is, boys! Let's show him what happens when you cross the Powder Gangers!
anger|You're not exactly making friends around here, are you?
anger|No!
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
neutral|Caesar said he expected to resume his campaign of terror and mayhem as soon as he receives medical clearance.
joy|Ha ha. Too weak.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
anger|Just keep on moving.
surprise|We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
joy|Hot damn, look who it is!
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
surprise|We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
anger|Ah, hell, what is it now?
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
fear|But it's not what you think. I can explain everything. Just hear me out.
surprise|Huh? Oh! Oh, right. Yeah. I'll take that. You should go now, before you draw any attention.
anger|Let it wait until I've stopped running, all right?
neutral|Looks like we got them, move fast and look alive.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
fear|I'm not scared of you. Give me a good reason to call the law and, I swear, you'll regret it.
anger|What do you want?
neutral|Caps it is. Will there be anything else?
joy|Well, their test scores are only marginally improved, but I'm hearing good things about the Misfits' teamwork.
sadness|Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for the missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured troopers.
neutral|Yeah, every once in a while you can find a cap with a blue star on it. They're pretty rare, so I started collecting them.
sadness|I feel pity for any man or woman that gets addicted to chems, but when they prey on decent folk... well, then it's time to put 'em down.
joy|He rarely stops in here these days - you'd do best to look for him out in the wastes east of New Vegas. He's always looking for new tribes to study.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
neutral|Help? Oh, well... you could speak to Ranger Jackson. He might have something for you.
joy|Confident, I like that.
sadness|No, can't say I do. I've got my own problems to worry about.
fear|You killed him! What have we done to you?
surprise|I've never seen a robot like that before.
neutral|Henry needs to be convinced to quit, one way or another. I won't have a useless employee on the company payroll.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
neutral|I'm an officer of the Legion, of the rank Decanus. When we encamped, I commanded a contubernium of eight Legionaries.
surprise|Grenade!
anger|Had enough?
sadness|Alrighty then, I'll just head out. Alone. By myself. Into the dangerous wastes.
anger|That's mine!
anger|We're only trying to help people, and you're not making it easy on us.
anger|You sure you're in the right place?
neutral|Those are the risks of a hunter's life. I've delivered as promised, but perhaps I should better search for someone with greater resolve and honor?
anger|What have you done?
surprise|So far working with the NCR hasn't been too bad. If anything, things seem to be getting better.
disgust|It was worth a try.
joy|Any day, baby, any day.
anger|Your insults are both unhelpful and unwanted. I'll thank you to keep them to yourself.
disgust|I have to keep an eye on that bastard Lem. The second I turn my back, he might go crying to the NCR.
anger|They killed her!
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
joy|Been doing a lot of good work out there, setting an example for the others - I know Ranger Jackson appreciates it.
joy|Those Legion beasts needed to be put down, like the vermin they are!
joy|Lady Luck smiled on our President.
neutral|Make it quick.
joy|The Followers are lucky to have a friend like you.
anger|I don't have time to talk. There's lots of work to be done here.
anger|Hmm, join the Great Khans or die in the wasteland? Good fucking plan Cooke.
surprise|What? How could you do that?
joy|You can't hide from me.
neutral|Don't tell me that you've fallen for the stories of noble paladins on crusade, preserving mankind's technology in a benighted age? Dross!
fear|It started about six months ago. At first it was just supplies going missing - we figured it was refugees. Then people started dying.
joy|Okay. Hold still. I don't want to make this any more painful than it already is.
anger|They killed her!
sadness|Can't go anywhere else.
surprise|Grenade!
sadness|Ouch! Come on, baby, don't be that way. You don't know what you're missing.
anger|You disgust me. How dare you say such a filthy thing in my establishment? I ought to have you arrested.
joy|That Legion boss would've never taken the city, but I'm glad he's a goner.
anger|What the hell?!
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
anger|Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker when I find out who did it.
anger|Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
anger|You lost me a great opportunity to deal a blow to the Profligates' morale. If not for the service you've rendered unto me, I'd have you crucified.
surprise|A good cat to swing with. Or was - until he stopped mewing.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
surprise|Okay, if that's what you think.
joy|I suppose it's only right you get a little something for your troubles. Here - my daddy left me this gun. Guess I don't need it no more.
anger|You gonna do it or not?
anger|Well, crap.
neutral|Success depends on forethought, dispassionate calculation of probabilites, accounting for every stray variable.
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
joy|NCR came all the way to save us, huh? Guess they missed the shit-holes.
surprise|I heard some Squatters talking about some fancy pants Rangers coming into the area soon. Like we need more NCR here.
joy|Well, still. Thanks again.
neutral|Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
joy|Thanks for your help, kid. So long!
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
joy|Thanks for helping us keep the Strip safe.
sadness|This place's got a weird gloom after Miss Weintraub died.
sadness|Cool. Maybe later.
anger|We're only trying to help people, and you're not making it easy on us.
joy|Camp McCarran is paradise compared to this place. A two-minute monorail and you're on the Strip!
disgust|Oh, boy, those clowns. Listen up, kid, and listen good, I don't care how many fancy Latin names he gives himself, a thug ain't nothin' but a thug.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
surprise|Holy shit!
neutral|I still don't know exactly. Just that a lot of people died who didn't want to be part of the fighting at all.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
anger|Gonna six this bitch.
joy|Excellent. As you can see, we have a lot of injured troopers here and I haven't had time to look at all of them yet.
anger|There's nothing I like better than making some other poor bastard die for his country.
anger|What have you done?
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
sadness|He was an Omerta that... fell in love with me. They don't ever mix with people outside the "family," you know?
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
joy|One day I'll get to see Deathclaws tear through Fiends!
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
joy|Where did you get these? You know what, it doesn't even matter. Thank you. These will be a tremendous help.
joy|Well, hello there. What a coincidence, finding you outside the Strip.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
surprise|Aha!
joy|Oh my, yes! They're a fascinating tribe with a long and, unfortunately, tragic history.
neutral|If we must.
neutral|Damned if I know. Put up a hell of a fight, though. We had them outnumbered, I don't know, twenty to one, maybe.
joy|I kinda like being a farmer.
neutral|Dismissed.
anger|We can't relax until we get the President out of here safely.
fear|It can't be! How the hell...
neutral|All clear!
neutral|Whatever.
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
neutral|I thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
sadness|Okay - you're right. I hate going outside. It's almost impossible for me to step out of here. Still, I love my vault. It's my pad!
neutral|The President is visiting today. Ranger Grant doesn't want anyone snooping around up there that doesn't have authorization.
joy|Have you seen what one of those anti-materiel rifles can do to a Deathclaw?
surprise|Aha!
anger|Benny is my prisoner. You don't "deal with him" unless you've dealt with me.
neutral|Just saying.
neutral|Even if I could get in, rehab is for chumps. Well, thanks for doing what you could.
neutral|VStoryEventHanlon set to 3.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
neutral|Keep your heads down and move up to the next location.
sadness|I came east to strike it rich, and now I'm broker than ever. What do I tell my family back home?
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
fear|You killed him! What have we done to you?
anger|Whatever it takes to step over us honest folk is good enough in their book. Heck has bought NCR senators left and right, and then is even worse.
neutral|I didn't want to herd Brahmin for a living, so I signed on with the Crimson Caravan and headed east. Not much to tell, really.
neutral|Liza O'Malley at the Embassy may have some information for you as well.
neutral|My thoughts exactly.
joy|We owe you so much for saving our President.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
anger|To make things worse, I think someone might be stealing my supplies.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
joy|You can't hide from me.
neutral|I have, however, told her how instrumental you were in revolutionizing our cuisine. And she knows what we stand to gain from a ruler who supports it.
neutral|That's all right.
neutral|The rest of the dam is fully under our control. A few pitiful holdouts remain, but their time is short. The general was the last source of concern.
neutral|Oh he was pretty average, I'd say. Average height, average age. Dark hair. Beard of some kind.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
neutral|It might be too big.
neutral|According to a new report, violent crime is on a sharp decline in New Vegas. The report credits the decline of the population of Fiends in the area.
neutral|Few openly blamed the rangers for Hanlon's treachery, but public and political support for the military as a whole quickly dwindled.
neutral|I need to get the caravans moving again, that means clearing a path north. There's too much crawling the asphalt up the road to allow it.
joy|Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
fear|Yeah, but I don't want to go feral, and that's probably what more radiation would do to me.
joy|When you're ready to saddle up, come find me down on the casino floor and we'll plan the next step of this caper.
anger|I don't know what went on between you and Anderson, but leave me out of it.
fear|The Legion is assembling a massive army on the other side of the river. How can we stop an army when we can't even handle their raiding parties?
joy|Lem was going to turn us all in to the NCR, I'm glad he's dead.
neutral|Let Contreras know we'll have the extra guns and ammo ready for the next shipment.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|I don't want to risk running into a pack of those freaks alone, though. Could you escort me out of here?
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
joy|My hotel room is so small, when I put the key in the lock, I broke the window!
neutral|Thanks for all your help.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
joy|Another satisfied customer.
neutral|The Kings gang in Freeside has put an official end to hostilities with the NCR. An RNV reporter was on-hand to speak with The King.
anger|That's not a good idea.
neutral|Wait right there. You told my men that Alice's mother was waiting for me outside, didn't you?
disgust|Whoa, baby! Am I looking at a mirror, or are you just that ugly?
joy|Okay. Hold still. I don't want to make this any more painful than it already is.
disgust|Losers don't matter in the history books. He's a fucking footnote.
neutral|Good work, stranger. The Thorn will nurture these eggs until their hatchlings are ready to bleed for us.
neutral|Just doing what I'm paid to do - harass the muties until they leave or attack us. If they leave, we let 'em go. If they attack, we wipe them out.
neutral|This is business. I really can't cut them a deal on the cost.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
surprise|Aha!
neutral|You're gonna love this next song. I guarantee it.
neutral|In addition...
neutral|Energy weapons and power armor are usually tops on our list, although I appreciate anything that's vintage.
anger|Made in the U.S.A.!
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
neutral|Goodbye.
anger|Thought no one was looking, did you?
neutral|Move up to the next position.
neutral|The Omertas themselves likely won't be forthcoming, so you may need to talk to some of their help to pick up a trail. Anything else?
surprise|I have a report here that says the Legion forces at Nelson have been taken care of and that you had a hand in it.
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
anger|Stupid head voice wrong! I know you're there!
neutral|Then gather together the firepower or explosives or whatever else you need and improvise.
anger|Well done, stranger. Here's your share.
anger|Had enough?
anger|Big fucking deal. Hand it over.
neutral|Now if you'll excuse me I've got some security procedures to oversee.
joy|Haven't found any Radroaches, so far.
surprise|Sounds like the NCR and the Legion are both gearing up for a fight. Been seeing a lot more soldiers around.
neutral|More than you already have? Might want to ask around, but truth is, you've already helped out a lot in the short time you've been here.
neutral|Baby, getting outplayed and getting cheated ain't the same thing.
anger|Had enough?
joy|Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
joy|My lucky day, running into our President's savior!
joy|The scouts I occasionally sent west many years ago reported these tales, but never had contact. Well, except the ones who went missing, perhaps.
joy|I don't care much about your tastes. Get lost and leave me alone.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
neutral|I will. That's the last time I pick up a straggler on the road, believe me.
neutral|There were a few he only trusted me with. I can think of at least one that'd prove my point, if it still exists.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
neutral|Is there anything else I can help you with?
disgust|Ready or not, here I come!
anger|Waste of ammo.
anger|I heard you killed Benny over at The Tops. I bet you think you're some sort of tough cookie.
sadness|Quartermaster Mayes was yelling at us about rationing again. Where does the guy get the energy to yell so much while on rations?
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
fear|What do you want with me?
joy|You can't hide from me.
anger|If you're an enemy of the NCR, you're an enemy of mine. Get out of my sight.
surprise|Fucker pops back up, they'll wish they hadn't.
disgust|Can't be any worse than here.
joy|That comedian you mean? Yeah, he was a hell of a haggler. Cost me a pretty cap - hope he's worth it. Here's your 3%.
joy|I'd call that an understatement.
joy|I'll be damned! You mean the young Gunderson? That's a shave tail if I ever saw one - he's got less sense than a Brahmin at a crossroads.
neutral|Really? Wow, um... okay. Thanks.
surprise|Missing medical supplies? No, uhh... I don't know anything about that.
anger|You will be avenged, Brother.
disgust|Look, I'm not leaving this place 'til I have what I came for. I'll be in the storage basement if you change your mind.
neutral|For around five years now. I handle the supply ends of things - raw materials and stuff.
fear|Thank goodness you're here. My squad needs help.
neutral|What would you like to know?
disgust|Thanks. Your concern is touching.
sadness|Okay. Just let me know when you're ready.
joy|Thank you for the help. I can rest easier knowing those poor soldiers no longer have to suffer.
neutral|Powder Ganger? What? I mean, yeah, used to be, sure!
neutral|You've got yourself a deal.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
fear|They're gonna try to take the dam again, real soon. And if they do, Vegas as we know it will cease to exist.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
anger|What have you done?
sadness|Another day, another battle, another dead trooper. When is this shit going to end?
surprise|It's some kind of data storage device, dig? So it's the data on the Chip that's platinum, not the Chip itself.
sadness|I wish the rest of the Vault were accessible.
fear|Radscorpions. Fuckers creep the hell out of me. I'm not going outside while they're still crawling around.
anger|You better be sleeping with one eye open.
neutral|Great, just leave me here, then.
neutral|I didn't receive any clear video of the incidents, but telemetry from the units destroyed indicates they were attacked with energy weapons.
fear|I don't want any trouble, okay?
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
anger|He was much more interested in gambling and prostitutes, and because of his family, I can't simply fire him.
sadness|Why free me now? After what you done? I ain't saying thank you.
sadness|I sent some troops out to find more supplies, but they never returned. I need you to track them down and help them bring back the supplies.
fear|Leave me alone!
neutral|Yes, I suppose you're right. Please, accept half of our reserve. We'll manage, somehow, as we've always done.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
joy|Not that I know much of the world - I never left this place, come to think of it... but it is the most special vault, ever!
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
sadness|Maybe you just ain't had a healthy dose of human niceness in a while.
joy|That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
anger|Bullying me won't make me give it to you.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
neutral|I knew I shouldn't have trusted you! You're going to pay for that!
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
neutral|I'm still not saying.
anger|Praetorians! Kill this nuisance!
surprise|Found you!
surprise|All right, you drive a hard bargain, baby. Tell you what, I'll bump him up to 3,000. That's fair. Here's your cut.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
anger|We are lean! We are mean!
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
neutral|Supplies to make chems. The NCR's the best source since they're hard to come by anywhere else.
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
anger|Flank 'em!
surprise|You'll find that my electronic sensors are quite sophisticated.
neutral|The enemy is much more fortified ahead, and have snipers set up at key positions, which keep our men pinned down.
sadness|Sorry, boss. Must be my glaucomas acting up again.
anger|Grrrraah!
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
joy|I hope you're doing well, friend!
joy|This place smells like booze and sex. That's why I always come back.
fear|You're not going to raze us to the ground, like you did to Forlorn Hope, right?
anger|Come on!
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|The Strip: Shunned.
anger|That's all I'm going to do, though, unless you can get me some more proof.
neutral|Anderson acted docile, but as soon as White turned to go, Anderson shot him in the back. At least that's what Anderson told me.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
neutral|Monorail's just ahead, boys, keep moving.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
neutral|Only if you come within a mile or so of them.
fear|As you wish. When the Republic goes to war, we go with it.
neutral|That should work. We'll do a weighted exchanged based on the going value of meat and vegetables. Water is invaluable in this dusty hole.
anger|What have you done?
anger|Pisses me off that Legion slavers can just operate on NCR turf like that.
joy|It's hard to sleep in this place, I tell you. Last night some girl was pounding on my door all night. Finally I had to let her out.
neutral|Sure.
anger|Since you don't seem willing to do the world a favor and kill yourself, I guess I'm going to have to do it for you.
disgust|Yeah, that's one word for it.
fear|Look out!
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
anger|I'll show you gutless, you sniveling bastard. I'll spill your guts all over this room!
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
joy|Thanks.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
anger|Don't you know who I work for?
anger|Mind where you point those dimmers.
anger|Hell, my men probably got ambushed by a raiding party! But we need those supplies, and we need them badly.
anger|I knew it. Every one of the false reports was signed off by Chief Hanlon at Camp Golf, but why would the Chief manipulate the reports?
anger|Don't worry boss, you'll know if I find anything.
anger|
neutral|Do as I say, and your rewards will be immense. Thwart me, and your punishment will become the purpose of my existence.
anger|I'll believe it when it happens!
joy|Confident, I like that.
disgust|You're gonna learn how Uncle Sam deals with commie maggots!
joy|That Caesar bastard had it coming.
sadness|Now there's not enough supplies to go around even if I wanted to serve the rest of Freeside, which I don't.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
sadness|I calculate your chance of success as... well, no need to be morbid.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
anger|Let's see you handle this!
surprise|I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
surprise|So far working with the NCR hasn't been too bad. If anything, things seem to be getting better.
joy|Taking down a Giant Radscorpion, by yourself, has made you popular down here.
neutral|It's possible, but I've yet to see any hard evidence or hear of any cases where humans were negatively affected.
neutral|Ah, then you know how rare they are. I'm just glad they're back where they belong. You can never be too careful these days.
neutral|Much as I sympathize, their theft would put me in a bad spot. I got a crop quota to meet.
joy|I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
surprise|Hey!
surprise|Hey, okay, but don't take too long, I don't want to miss this!
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
anger|All right, fellas. Let's get out of this shit hole.
neutral|I can't believe that an entire pack moved into the quarry. I thought that kind of bad luck only happened in New Vegas.
neutral|Like I said earlier, we have some supplemental forces on the way, but this wasn't the situation I was expecting, so I can only offer what is on hand.
fear|I don't want any trouble, okay?
anger|No!
anger|Where'd you go, punk?
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|There is a negotiation with a smaller trading outfit that I'd like resolved as quickly as possible.
joy|Welcome back, friend! How can I help you?
neutral|I'd rather not join my buddies any time soon.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
fear|Cant' do business now! There's a gunfight!
joy|Pleasure doing business with you. Of course, this whole deal never happened, am I right?
neutral|In any event, no one will miss them. And I've got another mission for you.
fear|The Khans are all gone, wonder if they left behind their shit for making our goods.
anger|You'll pay for what you did to the Powder Gangers!
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
anger|Get your own!
neutral|Keep up the good work!
anger|I'll take you down with me!
fear|Sure, I'll stop using my rather effective gun and switch to, ah, this piece of metal tubing here. Great plan, boss.
anger|Oh Swank, you finky bastard...
neutral|It's a modest presence, a single finger of the Legion reaching across the river's narrows. But with me here, it has an iron knuckle.
fear|I give up! Please don't do no harm to me, mister, leastaways not my face. All I got left is my rugged good looks. What do you want to know?
sadness|As you wish.
joy|All right! See you soon.
fear|Give it a chance. For me. I can't stay here and watch us waste away.
disgust|Well, not exactly. More like... trying to expand our markets. I heard there was a lot of untapped territory down south, but the Legion caught me.
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
surprise|We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
sadness|Thanks for looking into this, I appreciate it even though you didn't find anything.
neutral|He's a toy. I'm not a baby, you know.
anger|Gonna kill you for wasting my time.
neutral|Crocker. Can. Kiss. My. Sweet. Republic. Ass.
anger|They killed him!
neutral|Janet will be paid what she's owed. Consider it a gift.
neutral|More than a few, if I have my way.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
neutral|I suppose.
anger|It's no picnic, I'll tell you that much. My troops are out here every day dying for the NCR, but they've left us out to dry.
anger|I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
neutral|Caps it is. Will there be anything else?
surprise|So you've found out what's happening with the supplies?
disgust|Better not try that again.
joy|I hope you're doing well, friend!
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
neutral|Wealthy Brahmin baron Heck Gunderson was arrested in the Ultra-Luxe Hotel as a suspect in his son's murder. A hotel spokeswoman had this to say.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|What's eating you?
anger|A piece of advice, if you mess with any of my men, you'll regret it.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
neutral|Maybe Bitter Springs just seemed different. Maybe it's the same as killing legionaries.
surprise|Thought I was already holding back.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
anger|You dirty coward!
neutral|Watch out for her - she's one of the deadliest fighters I've ever seen.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
neutral|Caesar's Legion: Accepted.
neutral|I understand. Get back to me with an answer as soon as you can.
neutral|'Cause that's the law of the land. You never know when someone's going to stab you in the back... and I like mine upright.
anger|We're going to tear them apart!
neutral|The strongest Geckos you'll ever see are ready to fight.
disgust|A little peace and quiet, at last.
sadness|Momma left me on a farm when she went out prospecting, but when she never came back, the owner didn't want me around and kicked me out on my own.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
neutral|Mojave, mo problems, am I right?
anger|Bit of a troublemaker, aren't you?
neutral|Y-You're right. These men have placed their lives in my hands, and I won't throw them away for a lost cause.
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
joy|Someone like you... I'm just glad to have you on board. Do whatever you can. Security sweeps, talk to people, keep an eye out.
neutral|Can barely see the street.
neutral|People come to me to resolve their disputes with my wisdom.
anger|You take out a debt, it's only a matter of time before someone comes collecting. Things just finally caught up with me.
neutral|I'm just the middle man. The Great Khans are a hard group, and some of them are no good, but they're not all the same.
neutral|We need to stop and pee soon.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
neutral|I want you to assist the security detail we've prepared for the president. His safety is critical to maintaining the mens' fighting spirit.
anger|We're kind of busy around here for social calls, so if you're not here to help out, just stay out of my way.
neutral|Once I had enough, I made a necklace out of them, since I thought they were lucky.
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
joy|Us NCR folk got to stick together, even if the Strip is the safest place in New Vegas.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
surprise|Huh? What are you talking about?
anger|They killed him!
fear|I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
anger|Go away.
disgust|Don't listen to a word No-bark says. I don't think he ever sleeps, so it's no wonder he spouts nothing but nonsense.
surprise|Hey!
fear|I don't want any trouble, okay?
neutral|We crossed the river when the Profligates fled from Searchlight. From here we stage raiding parties and process captures.
anger|I should make you pay for your crimes!
neutral|Why does anybody? I thought I'd strike it rich at the tables, make my fortune and never have to plow those damn fields again.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
surprise|Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
surprise|You have? What are you waiting for, kid? Spill the beans!
anger|Had enough?
joy|I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
disgust|Jesus, I can't even believe it. After all House did to set us up with this swank joint. I don't suppose there's more?
surprise|I hear Caesar's dead. Maybe that means the war will be over soon.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
joy|NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
neutral|Hey, welcome to Red Rock Canyon! Since you've done so much for the Great Khans, Papa Khan told me to let you know you can buy weapons at our Armory.
neutral|This next song is... just magical. I hope you enjoy.
joy|You don't have to say anything - I am Papa Khan, and I have spoken. When I'm gone, you will lead the tribe.
neutral|I'll see you around.
disgust|He's just another coward. He wants us to leave the vault and hand our asses to the NCR, as if they'd treat us like human beings.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
joy|All right! Please, follow me. We'll head into the vault right away.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
joy|We need more people like you around.
neutral|Sure. Just don't ever ask me if your outfit makes you look fat.
neutral|Our Elder before McNamara. He had a nose for recovering lost technology. He'd send Scribes out into the desert chasing whatever leads he found.
neutral|There's a comm terminal not too far from here I'd use to access messages from him. If we go there I can pull up his research on it.
surprise|I heard some Squatters talking about some fancy pants Rangers coming into the area soon. Like we need more NCR here.
fear|The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
joy|Let me know if you need anything else.
neutral|Okay, what would you like to know?
anger|Mark my words, you piece of shit. This is the last time you will ever refuse to perform an order I've given you.
neutral|Fine.
anger|Return to me when you've destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel.
neutral|Good. The President doesn't arrive until tomorrow. Let's get some rest and we'll have a brief talk first thing in the morning.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
joy|Another satisfied customer.
neutral|Intel we had back in the NCR said they had a whole succession lined up. They'll replace him as soon as word gets out.
disgust|It's amazing what passes for a firearm around here. You'd be better off throwing rocks.
surprise|These bots now have eyes on their backs, I swear!
fear|Please, no more!
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
neutral|Okay, but please find him as soon as you can.
joy|But I can't complain. I'm not in the field as much as the others. I just stay here most of the day coming up with activities to occupy the camp.
disgust|Try robbing me, will you?
neutral|If you can find a way to cut off access to the sulfur in the caves below the vault, I've got some caps waiting for you.
neutral|Those were our top stories.
anger|The NCR's just a corrupt and bloated monster, no better than any other Wasteland crawler. We make this land wealthy, and we ain't giving it up.
surprise|You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
anger|Damn!
joy|Aren't you the one that saved President Kimball? That must have been some speech, eh?
neutral|Was the Courier male or female, and what kind of karma did the Courier have?
neutral|The preceding segment was sponsored by the Silver Rush. Silver Rush. Feel the rush of a warm laser in your hand.
surprise|Head voice say bear heads still talking. Is surprised at this.
anger|Boss, if I heard something, you really should have heard something.
neutral|This also only one camp of many. You might have noticed the other camps down by the river.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
sadness|I suppose so. Sorry, this isn't your problem, I shouldn't be going on to you about this.
anger|Being sentimental is not how I made the Crimson Caravan so successful, but I'll allow it, just this once.
joy|You cannot hide from me, you commie maggot!
surprise|Culture is an odd thing. Sometimes a tribe grows tired of its identity, grabs for an opportunity to reimagine itself.
joy|NCR should take this chance, now that Mr. House's out of the way.
neutral|So I'll be overseeing the security team personally and keeping in constant contact with people over the radio.
neutral|We started it a few years ago. I admit, we had a lot of trouble at first, but eventually we got some help from Tom Anderson with the Followers.
joy|I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
neutral|What about the Fiends?
anger|That's not a good idea.
surprise|Huh?
neutral|The NCR keeps things safe and orderly, but it's all very boring. So, I came out east towards the frontier.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
joy|Hello, ma'am.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|There's a small trading outfit, Cassidy Caravans, that I'm interested in acquiring. They've been rather competitive, so it's time to buy them out.
disgust|Why do I get all the hoodlums?
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
surprise|Hey!
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
joy|Here's your 3%, baby. You enjoy that.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
anger|Yeah, right. Bitch.
neutral|I swear... I'm not drinking... ever... again.
anger|They killed her!
anger|Make it quick, we don't want to lose the element of surprise.
disgust|Murderer!
neutral|Caesar strictly forbids the use of chems and alcohol. By his order, all visitors must also relinquish their arms upon entry.
joy|Everybody loves the Chairmen, because we show them a simple good time, no strings attached.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
neutral|It would've made sense for things to end here. But now... I'm still waiting.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
joy|Jack handles the small-time purchases. You should talk to him unless you're looking for a major shipment.
neutral|Lily is eccentric, certainly, but I've never felt she was dangerous. More importantly, she asked if she could help me in some way.
disgust|I've heard of you. You better not cause any trouble around here, we have enough problems as it is.
joy|Sorry I couldn't help more, especially since you're being so nice.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
surprise|So you're the one Major Polatli sent?
neutral|More sexual favors than I can even count. I am still tired from it.
surprise|Found you!
joy|You should read it, it's fascinating stuff.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
disgust|So much violence in the world these days.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
anger|Good riddance, Mojave.
joy|You been to the Strip? Last time I had R&R, I left with 300 caps more than I went in. Who says the House always wins?
neutral|I bet me and Stacey can get something real cool at Mick and Ralph's with that.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
joy|I've got this recipe for a Deathclaw Omelet that I've been itching to try out. Trouble is - I need a Deathclaw egg. Kinda obvious, I suppose.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
anger|And I only asked first... I'll try one last time before I find out the hard way. Where you come from, and where you going?
joy|Tell you what. Bring us those suits, and you can come with us while we loot the town. You can keep a share.
fear|What happens now?
sadness|This place has come a long way, but ever since Sarah's death it is not the same.
neutral|Aw, man. It's Stacey's fault. She pretends like she didn't get hit.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|More reinforcements are in from Primm. Damn glad to have those guys here.
joy|I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
neutral|But in a shocking turn of events, the Dam has been rendered useless, and both sides have taken heavy casualties. Neither faction appears to have won.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
anger|What was that for?
neutral|Until you do this, consider yourself suspended... without pay.
joy|Here I was thinking you'd be a challenge, want a rematch?
anger|Let's see you handle this!
anger|You didn't have any proof?
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
anger|Grrrraah!
joy|And I'm staying at Vault 21, which is pretty cheap. For the Strip, anyway.
joy|I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
neutral|Working for the Gun Runners is a sweet job. None of us would dare screw it up.
fear|Alright, I'll give him a shot.
anger|Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
anger|No!
anger|I... what does this have to do with my - never mind! I just can't go outside, get it? There has to be another way.
neutral|Yeah?
anger|Look at the big hero. You here to save us?
neutral|If they won't listen, do what you can to make them listen. The dead need to be avenged.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
neutral|Don't have the patience for this drunk escort shit tonight...
joy|Wow, if it isn't the man who saved President Kimball. What can I do for you this fine day?
sadness|Damn it all... I sent some men out to get these supplies, but they never returned. I guess the Legion got them on their way back.
joy|Again, thank you, this is a huge help.
joy|You don't want to do that.
neutral|Why do they call it a monorail... it's a train. A *train.*
anger|We'll get 'em.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
anger|Come on!
surprise|Aha!
neutral|Good luck to you out here.
joy|We need more people like you in the NCR.
anger|You better be sleeping with one eye open.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
neutral|We arose from the Boneyards of Adytum years ago. Since then, we have made it our mission to rebuild the wasteland and reeducate its inhabitants.
sadness|Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
sadness|<Sighs> Nah, that'd be too far, even for those guys.
neutral|A paladin always has a say where the Codex is concerned. Veronica's aspirations are seditious.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
joy|The Followers of the Apocalypse came to our camp when I was a kid, and they brought a bunch of old books. I used to read pre-War poetry for hours.
neutral|Thanks.
surprise|Are you sure? I've got enough clout to get them started, but these guys are pretty lazy. I doubt they'll want to be pulled in different directions.
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
anger|If you have to ask, you're not authorized.
neutral|I'm in the Followers of the Apocalypse. How about you?
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
neutral|I'm afraid I can't do this for free. My supplies are stretched thin enough as it is.
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
fear|You killed him! What have we done to you?
fear|Please no!
fear|We're all fucked!
neutral|To do the job right, you've got to get rid of the pack leaders - the Mother Deathclaw and the Deathclaw Alpha Male. Should run the rest of 'em off.
fear|The last patrol I was on got hit by a Legion raiding party and I barely survived. I don't want to go back out there again.
neutral|If I had more time in their computers I could've accessed the full duty roster and guard deployment. Maybe you'll have better luck.
anger|So do everyone a favor and keep your mouth shut about it, okay?
anger|Quit screwing around!
neutral|Whatever.
fear|I hope my dad doesn't find out how much money those hookers cost me.
surprise|Head voices hear things. Many things. Not all make sense.
joy|Either way, baby, this is good news. Maybe I can finally sleep at night, knowing you didn't die.
neutral|There's still more killing to be done!
neutral|BoS: Vilified.
joy|Hey. Anything going on?
surprise|We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
anger|Kill them all! God will understand.
anger|Dammit, I thought I had you there. Let's play again.
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
joy|Great. Here's the package - your contact is Don Hostetler at the Crimson Caravan. Come back and see me when you're done.
neutral|Rumors continue to swell that Mr. House, the father of New Vegas, has passed away. Who will fill the power vacuum on the Strip remains uncertain.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
neutral|The only Khans this far into NCR territory is me and my crew, and I didn't steal squat from you.
neutral|Our duty is to the Codex above all, something your companion has forgotten. And that gives us the authority to make it our place.
neutral|Alright.
fear|Need to regroup!
joy|I never tire of talking about myself.
neutral|You'll have to pay for what you take, however. We can't afford to give away equipment. Did you have any other questions?
sadness|I... look, we can't talk here. If you think you can help me, follow me to my room, please.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
anger|He looked so surprised when I stuck that knife in his neck. Thought he was so tough, but he was so slow.
neutral|Deadly NightStalkers will now fight for our pleasure.
neutral|Thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
joy|You know, like "is that your face, or is a bowl of puke stuck in your collar?" I tell you, you gotta see this show!
surprise|Baby, you have got to be joking! Now take your cut and stop being crazy.
anger|Leo is going to give you such a paddling, you won't be able to sit down for a week!
joy|In the meantime, enjoy the high life. Room service is on me. I'll send up a bottle of the good stuff. Ta-ta.
surprise|Huh?
joy|This place smells like booze and sex. That's why I always come back.
anger|My troopers are my business. Stay out of it.
surprise|So, Ted's nowhere to be found and Heck's quite unprotected while looking for him, huh?
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
anger|Come on!
neutral|Security detail consists of rangers stationed here at the dam. Some will keep an eye on the crowd while others will watch the perimeter.
surprise|Is it time?
surprise|Whoa!
anger|I can't believe you've got the gall to stroll down the Strip after what you've done.
disgust|Don't dump your Ghoul here, we've already got enough shit around us.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|That's great! Thank you. I'm sure this will go a long way toward making things better here.
surprise|You're not going to do anything crazy here, are you?
joy|With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
joy|The crowd loves your bravery.
surprise|Weird, someone just told me that the Khans split the Vegas area. Wonder where they went, and why.
anger|Ordinarily I would, but it seems like all our clients have ended up dead. You could talk to Jack - he's always looking for new recipes.
neutral|The Master thought he could unify everyone. No more differences, no more war. Didn't end well.
joy|You can't hide from me.
neutral|From talking to the boys that were fighting up there, I can tell you that Hanlon managed to pull off what most people would have thought impossible.
neutral|Don't think your servile gesture earns my respect, stranger. But if that's how you want it, so it'll be.
anger|Nothing here, boss.
neutral|He's going to arrive, give a speech, and then leave. No meet and greet, no questions, just a quick in and out.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
joy|That much, huh? You're right, we could use a tribute to our... I mean, our family's coffers.
fear|The ground in Forlorn Hope was soaked red, from the blood of our own people!
surprise|What on earth is *that* creature?
sadness|I heard the Legion veteran troops are coming to the front lines. That's the last thing we need right now.
disgust|We've got an associate in the Crimson Caravan Trading Company who distributes for us in Outer Vegas. He's been after us for a new shipment.
anger|Had enough?
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
anger|The Legion is twisted, baby - original losers worshipping the king of creeps like he's some kind of god.
joy|That comedian you mean? Yeah, he practically begged me to hire him. Didn't even haggle. Here's your 3%.
disgust|I like my underwear to *not* be full of radioactive itching powder, thanks.
neutral|But we've got more important matters to attend to. The president is due to arrive soon, and we're sure the Legion won't waste such an opportunity.
neutral|Scramsville, baby. The Strip and you part ways, dig? You come around me again, you won't be getting back up.
neutral|They're my blood, lady. You don't just walk away from your blood!
joy|It's amazing that Kimball managed to survive.
anger|You'll kindly mind your tongue, or we shan't speak any further.
fear|You think so? I mean, I'd go myself, but what if they said no? The Khans wouldn't take me back, and then I'd have nobody.
neutral|A lifelong-learner is you, hey? Then make your questions count, because your lifelong is running lifeshort.
neutral|Don't give us any trouble now.
anger|There's more of them still out there.
anger|Dammit, I thought I had you there. Let's play again.
joy|I hope the Fiends stop their raids now that their boss is gone
anger|You better scram before I sic the entire Strip after you.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
fear|You again? Make it quick.
surprise|Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
neutral|VStoryEventBennyKilledFort to 3.
anger|The rangers at Echo have been keeping an eye on that place. It's relatively new, but those bastards have already dug in.
neutral|To arms, brothers!
fear|I had no idea there was such a thing as a friendly Nightkin. Look at that thing.
anger|I swear, I could kill you right now and never look back.
joy|I have some goods collected during my travels. You may take something if you wish.
anger|Because he complicates the equation of force. He's a free agent, an unpredictable element.
neutral|You can find it in the basement of the burned-out old building at the mouth of the canyon.
sadness|I... look, we can't talk here. If you think you can help me, follow me to my room, please.
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
anger|Well, well, well, if it isn't our whore, Joana... and, I don't believe this. Carlitos!
surprise|Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
anger|Come out and face your death!
surprise|What the hell? You got this from the Fiends already? Hot damn, you really are good. Thanks, this is exactly what I needed.
surprise|Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
anger|Come out and face your death!
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
neutral|But not no more! Powder Gang is small-time, man! I'm a winner! I won the motherfucking lottery!
neutral|So long.
anger|I'll take you down with me!
fear|How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
neutral|Because of the Deathclaws, I have to assume that the suitcase is still in Sloan. Snoop around the place and get it for me.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
anger|I see. Was there anything else, then?
joy|Lady Luck smiled on our President.
neutral|I'm afraid I can't do this for free. My supplies are stretched thin enough as it is.
disgust|What you want to know? Whole place used to be some kinda rich bastard resort, back before the war.
anger|That's not a good idea.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
surprise|Hey, who says I can't fix that? You bring me those boom-suits too, okay?
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
neutral|What the fuck...?
anger|We'll get 'em.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
anger|I am in command of my faculties! In command of my troops!
neutral|Your cardiovascular system is practically super-human. The Nociception Regulator won't boost it any further.
neutral|Cowardly, though. They outnumbered us, yet not once did they try to resist.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
neutral|The security codes are unique to the radios at each Ranger station. They're useless anywhere else.
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
sadness|Now I'm going to have to do the same to you.
anger|I've been trying to get someone to authorize this update - or at the least get field clearance to leave the camp and do this myself.
joy|The crowd loves your bravery.
joy|Alright, thanks for the help. Time to die loser.
neutral|Out here, we usually split our caravans into smaller bands - that way, we don't lose everything if they get hit.
neutral|Because they're ridiculous! Because they galavant around the Mojave pretending to be Knights of Yore.
anger|You again. What is it?
neutral|He isn't. I already checked there this morning. We were supposed to meet up here about an hour ago.
surprise|Holy shit!
joy|The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
anger|Had enough?
neutral|Now go, and teach them what you learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
joy|Cool. Can I try?
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
fear|This isn't like the sims!
neutral|Come back real soon!
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
surprise|Buildings not covered in blood. Chip is cause?
neutral|They saw the shit I did for the NCR, how I carried them on my back, brought fire to the heathens. I wasn't gonna help them but they begged.
anger|Nobody messes with the Kings.
anger|
disgust|I'm already doing that.
anger|You're lucky we Followers tend to be forgiving.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
surprise|Aha!
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
anger|We're done. Let the people of these hell-hole deal with their problems, I say.
anger|If you don't leave now, Leo might start chopping!
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
joy|I try to be frank and earnest with women. In New Reno, I'm Frank and in the Boneyard I'm Ernest.
neutral|So long, stranger.
joy|We should straighten those thugs at Gomorrah.
neutral|We've got a lot to do to prepare for the President's visit and not much time. Once we start we'll be on a strict timetable.
surprise|Grenade!
disgust|Good riddance.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
anger|To make things worse, I think someone might be stealing my supplies.
neutral|Sure, yeah. Just not too long, okay? I worry about them sometimes.
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
joy|I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
neutral|What does the Codex say?
surprise|You must be crazy if you're just "passing through" this place.
neutral|After all that we've accomplished?
joy|You'll have to try harder than that. The rumors about my heart being made of stone are true.
anger|Some say he's a man, others, a machine. I don't care. He's in the way.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|Monorail's just ahead, boys, keep moving.
joy|You can't hide from me.
joy|Good to see you around here. What can I do for you?
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
joy|It's cramped in here, sure, but who really needs a fancy room, anyway?
anger|But we have other problems. While investigating the Omertas, what little I could on my end, I came across something much more sinister.
sadness|Oh yes, sure sure. Ask away.
neutral|Guess I can't say for sure if they're NCR. Whoever they are, they want us dead or gone.
neutral|Any other objections? Maybe you'd like to bring the Brotherhood some flowers?
joy|Now let's just forget this little ambush, and meet up in the suite like we planned. How's that sound?
fear|That guy's got cold eyes. Definitely ex-military.
joy|You've done a fine job, friend. Here's a little something for your work.
fear|I hope my dad doesn't find out how much money those hookers cost me.
anger|Light 'em up!
fear|You see a Ranger in black, run the other way. Take you out from a quarter mile off.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
surprise|Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
neutral|Fair enough. Maybe one day I'll have your complete trust, and I can be on a long leash. A girl can dream.
neutral|Got a song for you, now. It's about a guy who's cold on the exterior, but deep down, you know he's a good man. And his name... is Johnny Guitar.
neutral|But that's not going to happen, because you're going to work for me.
joy|You're all set. Are we done here?
anger|What's your problem, punk?
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
surprise|You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
joy|Sure, kid, sure. What can I tell you?
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
joy|The beasts don't look so tough behind bars, huh?
anger|Can you handle this?
neutral|Cooke is planning to use the sulfur to make bigger explosives.
surprise|Found you!
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
neutral|Followers: Idolized.
joy|You handled yourself well against the Legion, and that took some of the pressure off of us. I'll send a couple of troops out there right now.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
fear|Okay, but this better not be a trick!
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
sadness|Won't ever make enough to live outside.
sadness|If you see Alice again, please, tell her we won't hold it against her. Tell Alice that we love her.
fear|What did I do wrong?
fear|
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
anger|Damn!
neutral|What do you want to know?
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|But mark me well. Any hint of treachery or thought of return and we will erase the both of you from existence.
neutral|Please remove your bra from the bottom of the fountain.
joy|I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
neutral|And there were other ways he wanted to push. Other weapons. Ones with ethics questions attached. Rather than deal with him, they sent him East.
disgust|Yeah you do that.
sadness|Can't go anywhere else.
surprise|Do I look like a seamstress to you? Those boomsters can stay in their nowhereville until the sun runs out of gas, for all I care. No deal.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
neutral|The NCR flag has been hoisted over former Legion outpost Nelson after heavy fighting. NCR officials are calling this a big win for troop morale.
sadness|I'm sorry.
joy|I bought my wife a little car here in New Vegas. An Omerta. It has a hood under the hood.
joy|Ba peasure is ah mah. Goobye!
anger|Ah. I suppose that's a very... compelling negotiating stance. Fine. The contract is yours. I hope you choke on it.
neutral|If he sees some indisputable sign we're on the wrong course, he won't ignore it.
sadness|Shit, maybe you're right. Guess I ought to give them a shot.
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
fear|Mercy!
disgust|Whatever the Chief had in mind, I'm sure it was the right thing to do - even if it did end up scaring a lot of people in the process.
joy|Baby, the odds may look long, but that's just because we ain't done rigging them. I won't toss the dice until we are.
neutral|This is our turf. Don't even try to snoop around or I'll fucking kill your right here, right now.
surprise|Sharp eyes on you, all right. We've gone through a heap of trouble to get in town. Ethel says I just need to wet my throat.
anger|Why are you even talking to me?
joy|Just a formality. Ain't like I expect to find you got a family history of getting shot in the head.
sadness|Sure, Caesar's a drag, but as long as we got each other, we don't care who the top dogs roll with.
anger|Mark my words - they're playing an angle. How do I know? They always are.
anger|You're outstaying your welcome.
anger|What was that for?
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
neutral|You've got yourself a deal.
anger|That's not really a pleasant topic of conversation. Let's just say we have our reasons.
neutral|Return to the Fort and do whatever it takes to recover the Chip.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
surprise|Word is the Khans signed a treaty with the NCR. Never saw that coming.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
fear|Yeah, sure. I hope you know what you're doing, kid.
surprise|Whoa!
anger|You're not exactly making friends around here, are you?
anger|What have you done?
anger|Cut it out, will you?
anger|So yes, fortune favors our chances, messenger. Provided *you* move quickly.
fear|There's a slim chance. But if the Legion wanted us dead, our heads would already be on pikes.
neutral|Very well. It will be worth it, I'm sure.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
joy|I'll give you a quick tour of my home! Oh, yeah, if you like.
anger|She... Alice left, didn't she? I can't believe you let her go! Some help you've been!
neutral|The computer should know what happened to them.
neutral|Have half a mind to throw you all in a cell and let you sweat it off.
neutral|You can find it in the basement of the burned-out old building at the mouth of the canyon.
anger|What the hell?!
anger|Don't talk to me!
disgust|I hope you'll be a half-decent challenge.
anger|There's a first-class offer on the table. The rest is up to you.
surprise|I've never seen a robot like that before.
neutral|I won't tolerate anyone that interferes with the fights. Offend me, and your blood will be the next to spill. Other than that, anything goes.
neutral|Caesar is the salvation of mankind, his Legion the rebirth of civilization in a benighted age.
neutral|The Crimson Caravan Company has been in business for over 130 years. We're partially responsible for the progress in the NCR.
surprise|Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
fear|What do you want with me?
surprise|I heard it got nasty at the Tops; wish I could've seen the shooting.
surprise|These bots now have eyes on their backs, I swear!
joy|We came here from Primm about a month past. Doesn't look like much, but it's one hell of a location.
neutral|Okay. Take good care of him and bring him back when you're done.
joy|I hope the Fiends stop their raids now that their boss is gone
anger|Back already? What do you need?
neutral|Take it.
neutral|VStoryEventSecuritronsFort set to 2.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
surprise|I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
joy|Hey, what can I do for you?
anger|Your business, huh? Now there's a store worth tending.
disgust|Careless of the NCR to let their monorail get blown up. Don't they have sentries standing watch?
neutral|Ugh, Crocker will have a field day with this. He'll want to establish diplomatic relations with them, for pete's sake.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
fear|I have to watch Cooke. I wouldn't put it past him to just start killing the opposition, starting with me.
anger|They killed her!
neutral|Have you ever been in love with a celebrity? You don't have to be shy, I feel it between us, too. Sometimes you can't help being Mad About the Boy.
neutral|Done.
fear|Whoa... you're right. I should start a side project making meds to keep my aura clean.
anger|What the hell do you want?
fear|Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
surprise|Got any more of those? I wanna blow something up too!
sadness|I heard Private Stone turned himself in for stealing medical supplies. We're all stressed out here, but stealing medical supplies is low.
anger|You want to be getting that gun out of my face right now.
neutral|I like punching things, but sometimes shooting things just has to do.
surprise|Hey!
joy|NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
joy|I bet he does. That's from hookers and chems. His work for us is the most restful part of his day.
neutral|Well... no I guess not. Okay - you show me a good time, and I'll return the favor.
anger|Unfortunately, the Boomers keep to themselves and are, let's say, hostile to all outsiders. That is why I need someone like you.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
joy|There's always more next day.
joy|Sure thing, boss.
neutral|A few months ago, she clammed up. Odds are she's scared, but I've had no way of approaching her. Start with her.
anger|See, my friends and I, we were kinda wondering if we should give you a good beating right now, or save it for when we catch you outside.
joy|If you ever need the assistance of the Followers, just ask.
surprise|Aha!
joy|If you're down on your luck and need some caps, I buy just about anything. Of course, I've also got plenty of things for sale, too.
anger|What makes you think I give a damn about you?
anger|No invitee has dared to challenge him yet. Maybe it's an issue of respect - he is getting on in years.
neutral|I'll say that White and I had a... falling out over a woman. A crime of passion, if you will.
surprise|I can't believe the King is dead. What's going to happen to us now?
surprise|Hey!
neutral|We've worked with them in the past. The NCR became too focused on things like patents and profitability, so the Followers go their own way now.
sadness|I hear more troops are gathering at Hoover Dam. Things are probably going to get pretty messy over there real soon.
joy|I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
joy|Saw a monster rip a man in half at The Thorn.
neutral|NCR: Accepted.
anger|I can't believe you've got the gall to stroll down the Strip after what you've done.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
joy|We're finally getting all the water we're supposed to. It's about time.
neutral|What can I do for you?
disgust|With business booming like it is and considering I'm the only person with medical experience in the camp, I could perhaps use a hand.
anger|Let's see you handle this!
neutral|Freeside: Accepted.
neutral|All right. Did you want something else?
anger|I may have my hands full here, but I'm anything but careless.
sadness|But this - the kids and the psychological trauma and all the rest - is out of my league.
joy|You can't hide from me.
surprise|Huh?
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
sadness|That's too bad. I hope you'll change your mind.
joy|I didn't just spend time there, I lived there, okay? I was family. All I wanted, I had. Caps, booze, drugs, women, power, you name it.
joy|Okay, we can have more fun together, but it's not going to be free, hon.
joy|I have some disguises for us. I've already got mine. A wealthy Brahmin Baron who bribed his way into seeing the President.
neutral|Cheat? The only way I could cheat is if I was so doped up on painkillers that I don't feel anything.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
anger|Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker if we find out who did it.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
anger|Does that sound like democracy to you, or a hereditary dictatorship?
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
fear|I'm getting out of here!
neutral|We need to stop and pee soon.
joy|Yes. Yes! That's it! I have a camera! It is old but it should work. Perhaps you could bring me images of inspiring landmarks?
neutral|Here's your disguise. This'll get you past most of the NCR there, but watch out for the rangers. Odds are this won't fool them.
joy|Hahaha! Yeeeehaw! Now, that's something I thought I'd never hear.
fear|You're not going to cause any problems, right?
disgust|Oh, now, what surprise - someone trying to smuggle in weapons.
disgust|I managed to kill that thing, but not before it mangled my leg all up. No way I'm walking out of here like this.
joy|You have my thanks for that. Those guys have been giving us a lot of trouble for a long time now.
joy|My lucky day, running into our President's savior!
anger|Flank 'em!
neutral|Excellent.  We should be able to get the shipments started in about a week.
anger|That's not a good idea.
disgust|You haven't seen what they did to the other troopers, and I'd rather not find out why they took all of the bodies.
anger|They killed him!
fear|I hope my dad doesn't find out how much money those hookers cost me.
neutral|If not for him, we'd still be living in tents or shacks, scavenging for food like animals. If we were alive at all.
joy|Nice try. Let's play another game.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
sadness|I guess... I guess it's the only chance I've got.
anger|First up was the "lucky losers." They got decapitated - guess that's "lucky" because it's pretty quick.
anger|I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
joy|Excellent, just let me grab my scalpel, and a body bag and we'll get started.
anger|It can't work like that, baby - not out in public like this. You really need me to spell that out?
neutral|VStoryEventLegionHowitzer set to 0.
fear|This isn't like the sims!
joy|Hot damn do I love this place.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
joy|That comedian you mean? Yeah, he practically begged me to hire him. Didn't even haggle.
joy|Hey. Anything going on?
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
neutral|Your words have merit... Very well. I shall tell my men to concentrate their efforts here.
disgust|Better not try that again.
anger|If you want to know more about the Ambassador, go talk to him yourself.
anger|You're frightening the children! Leave!
fear|Damn it all to hell!
joy|Still, if the King's willing to deal with us, perhaps we can work something out. I'll tell my men to stand down.
anger|They killed her!
neutral|I want to know the secrets of their manufacturing process, which means you'll need to find some way to get inside their heavily-guarded factory.
neutral|Hey, welcome to Red Rock Canyon! Since you've done so much for the Great Khans, Papa Khan told me to let you know you can buy weapons at our Armory.
joy|Goodbye!
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
neutral|Excellent idea.
neutral|All right, two it is. They'll still be more than enough to take you down, I think.
surprise|Glad that fucker House is gone.
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
joy|So long, warrior.
neutral|At least, she did until some stranger came along and killed the Deathclaw. Shot it right in the eye.
anger|You want to be getting that gun out of my face right now.
joy|Hot damn do I love this place.
fear|So if you got any other plans for bulking up the Misfits crew, might want to see about them first.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
surprise|Aha!
surprise|Son, where I come from, a man doesn't just walk up to another man and offer him a job without even knowing him. What's your game?
joy|Those Legion beasts needed to be put down, like the vermin they are!
neutral|Once again, NCR President Aaron Kimball, dead at 48.
joy|Oh, you here to work? I think I have an extra shovel around here somewhere.
sadness|Let's just stay sharp.
joy|You got a crazy drop on me, baby, but you don't want to kill me. We should be working together.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
joy|I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
joy|Nothing personal.
fear|They seem to stick mostly to the south end of the camp.
joy|I'd pay very close attention to what he has to say, as well as any official papers he hands over for your perusal.
anger|Oh, you think I won't do it? You think I'm not right in wanting back my life!? I'll show you!
joy|I can't imagine this place will ever disappear.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
fear|I think you might just be onto something here, kid. Tell you what, I can't actively back your play, but I'll keep the Chairmen off your back.
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
surprise|I still can't believe the King agreed to work with the NCR. But he's the King, and the King knows best.
surprise|Holy shit!
sadness|We'll miss Red Lucy down here.
joy|This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
neutral|Bah! Humans.
anger|This job's boring enough without talking to you. Go see Alexander.
joy|I'm glad to see you here. We could definitely use your help.
joy|You can't hide from me.
neutral|The big one. The one the NCR is trying to hold onto, that the Legion's pushing for. Whole war depends on holding it.
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|Novac: Wild Child.
anger|I'm looking, I'm looking!
joy|Anything's better than staying here. Let's go.
joy|That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
surprise|The big showdown between the NCR and the Legion is coming soon, believe you me.
neutral|Sources report the NCR's top Ranger, Chief Hanlon, has died in a tragic revolver-cleaning accident inside his locked office at Camp Golf.
neutral|Oh, that reminds me, you might be happy to know that your efforts haven't gone unnoticed.
neutral|I'm afraid I can't do this for free. My supplies are stretched thin enough as it is.
fear|I know boss, and I know it is going to be hard for you to trust me again. But are you going to take the word of this outsider over mine?
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
joy|Radio says you stopped the President's assassin cold. Not bad.
joy|We need more people like you around.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
joy|You better control thatthing. Bots can't be trusted.
joy|You're the one making a name for yourself among the troops, aren't you? What is it you need?
joy|Groodalicious. That ought to rake in the caps. What do I owe you?
disgust|For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
neutral|Oh, it was great. I wouldn't trade it.
disgust|Fine, I'll just eat the cost and do a favor for Chomps. Just this one time only.
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
joy|Oh, heck, I've heard of you. Supposed to be a regular hero or something, ain't that right?
joy|The word means "butcher" in Latin. I was granted the name after proving myself in several battles.
joy|Hi. How are you today?
anger|
sadness|Not good. If we don't get more supplies, we're going to have to start using dirt for food and sticks and rocks for weapons.
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
anger|All that money buys him any NCR senators he wants - scoundrels, like Heck. There's just no way for us small folks to get by, much less prosper, kid.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
surprise|You've been making a name for yourself around here already.
neutral|This just in.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
sadness|No, I'm not. Not yet anyway. I'm Private Kyle Edwards, former NCR trooper.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
joy|So long.
anger|I'm... I don't know what's happening to me. I can't feel a goddamn thing anymore, empty and poisoned like the Wasteland.
joy|Done with you now.
surprise|Found you!
neutral|Is it functional?
neutral|All right. I'll dismantle the prototype to avoid any further incidents with the Nightkin.
neutral|The best Cursor in the Legion. You'll reach Fortification Hill without incident, that's for sure.
joy|What doesn't she do, huh? Sarah makes this hole look like a palace - damn nice pair of gams on her too. She never walks outside, though.
disgust|Murderer!
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
anger|The glory of the Great Khans will be restored, and once the NCR is pushed back to California, all the land from here to the Colorado will be ours.
joy|Saw a monster rip a man in half at The Thorn.
anger|It has something to do with the Securitrons, I know that much. Upgrades their hitting power, gives them heft.
sadness|I'll cover you from the ridge. Just make it quick. These boys should be put out of their misery, not plinked to death with some old varmint rifle.
neutral|Several witnesses report a Vertibird flying in from the Northeast. One of them, using binoculars, claimed it was being flown by a group of old men.
neutral|Oh my gosh, really? Well, I didn't see where they went, but I'll keep an eye out. Wow, I had no idea they were so dangerous.
neutral|That man knows where we are? Just when I didn't think this could get any worse!
joy|Well, here we are. No worse for wear, are you? I trust that if you need to cross Freeside again, you'll know who to hire.
neutral|I don't know about that...
neutral|Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|We don't take on new members, really. You can do the math on our long-term prospects based on that point. I keep hoping we'll change that.
neutral|Fuck no. No matter what that old bitch McLafferty says, my dad said I could be in charge of the New Vegas branch.
neutral|Talk to Jack, he'd be happy to sell you some top-quality chems. He'll even give you a discount.
joy|You would? Really? Okay, well then, here goes:
neutral|Thank you. I won't make any trouble when they come for me.
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
sadness|My soul aches, but not as much as my limbs, because I've been beaten severely.
anger|It's one thing to be taken hostage, another to be lashed to a sinking ship. So over Calhoun's objections, I decided to take certain steps.
joy|It looks like we've started getting reports from the tower's network! I'm sure the others will be able to make some sense of this.
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
anger|What is this Brahmin shit. I'm not getting the feeling we're all about to sing koombahyah here.
neutral|You actually came through for us. I... didn't expect that. Anyway, the Great Khans pay their debts and don't forget their friends.
neutral|Um... can you help me?
joy|I'm glad that the Legion base at Nelson is destroyed. Now maybe we can get some rest.
disgust|If there's something you want, spill it - otherwise, move along.
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
anger|I'm going to knock you off your axles.
anger|Hey! Be careful, I don't like people hurting my patients.
joy|House dead, Strip can belong to anyone who wants it. Fiends to rule.
neutral|I sent you packing last time for a reason. Why should I let you in now?
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
surprise|Right. Head to Red Rock Canyon - that's deep Khan territory, so watch your back. Talk to Jack, tell him Razz wants the usual. See you soon.
surprise|Holy shit!
neutral|Here you go. I promised you an extra reward for coming along, so that's what you get.
anger|Why are you people treating us like this?
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
neutral|You're going to leave, just like that? All right, stranger... Thank you for everything.
neutral|House gave the area around the Strip to the locals, but he has no interest in it, so he ignores it entirely. It just needs new management.
anger|If by some chance you want to find me again, and if by some even greater chance coyotes haven't picked my bones clean, I'll be at my shack.
neutral|I do decent enough. The NCR patrols usually stop by for a quick bite, and travelers like yourself pass by a couple times a week.
neutral|Got some Dean Martin coming up, talking about the greatest feeling in the world, love. "Ain't That A Kick in the Head." Sure is, Dino. It sure is.
sadness|Oh yes, raised in that tradition. And the teaching stuck. I was taught it was my responsibility to bring the torch of knowledge to the wastes.
disgust|Is that so? Can't say I've ever heard a good word about you. Lot of bad ones, though.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
sadness|Those troopers deserve a clean death.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
surprise|Put that down!
anger|Damn!
joy|I can't wait to see what fights next.
disgust|Barbarians.
anger|What is it this time?
sadness|A ransom? I doubt that snake's got enough soul to care that much for his own youngin. Besides, what's to stop him after his son's returned?
surprise|
joy|We owe you so much for saving our President.
neutral|Indeed I have, my articulate friend. Not a few minutes ago I chanced upon a pair of destitute orphans grappling over just such an item.
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
joy|Welcome to the 188 Slop & Shop. How can I help you?
surprise|Well, we know your vitals are good.
anger|Got 'em in my sights!
anger|I made my living sneaking into NCR camps looking for shit to steal. I got sloppy, and then I got caught.
neutral|And nearly died for it. Tomorrow you'd do it all over again, having learned nothing.
neutral|Stay safe.
surprise|Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, boss, what the hell?
fear|I don't want any trouble, okay?
sadness|This is the Bitter Springs refugee camp. We've been maintaining it for a few years now, ever since Caesar's Legion started seriously pushing west.
neutral|Right. All right, here's the deal.
neutral|What's going on with the Great Khans?
disgust|Yeah, I really don't want to be here right now.
fear|I saw you being awfully friendly with Joe Cobb, so no thanks.
anger|You dirty coward!
sadness|Won't ever make enough to live outside.
fear|After what happened to Mr. House, nobody knows for sure what's in play for the Strip.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
disgust|Darling, where I come from, a lady doesn't just walk up to a man and offer him a job without even knowing him. What's your game?
anger|Let's get to fighting! Now is not the time to talk!
sadness|Well, as it turns out, we had a string of bad harvests a few years back. Pa said he couldn't afford to feed but three youngins, or we'd starve.
neutral|It's a free wasteland.
joy|Thanks for finding these. You should check in with the Major, he'll want to know about this.
anger|I need someone to talk to a few of the officers and help them resolve some of the problems around here.
disgust|Oh, this should be good. I mean, what's on your mind, boss?
joy|They have a fantastic menu at the diner.
neutral|The bunker will be destroyed, and you'll die instantly.
fear|Noooooooo!
anger|What the hell?!
neutral|I sure am, stranger. But there ain't anything about you that makes me want to go into details.
neutral|Yeah, it's time for me to sleep now.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
joy|Looking good so far. Go ahead and give the vigor tester a try. We'll learn right quick if you got back all your faculties.
joy|Want to see the best of New Vegas? Our sewers got it - The Thorn!
fear|Don't... do anything to me, okay?
neutral|You'd have to be the meanest, toughest, roughest bastard in the wasteland to have any chance against them, and I don't think that's you.
fear|Personally, I've never seen a woman in Legionaire's armor, so I have my doubts.
neutral|Still feels like I'm living on borrowed time. But I don't see any reason not to take a lot more of those sons of bitches with me.
anger|That's the stupidest argument I've ever heard. I'm not letting my star performer go without some guarantee of new incomes.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
anger|That isn't yours!
anger|You dirty coward!
anger|Cut it out, will you?
anger|Baby, ease off the gas. The Chip belongs in the hands of someone who can use it. As in me, not you.
joy|The enemy has retired before the awesome might of the U.S. army.
joy|A Ranger, here in the Strip? Fine company, sir!
joy|You can't hide from me.
joy|I'm pleased that you listened to the entire story! Perhaps there are details you'd like to know more about? Let me know.
neutral|That's my question to the Elder. All these years, the Brotherhood has collected weapons technology. And for what?
joy|Great fighting today.
joy|Ask me, I think he's got a dame from Gomorrah holed up in his suite, because nobody ever saw him leave it.
surprise|Head voices wonder... why bull doggies die?
neutral|Caesar prides himself on selecting the right tool to overcome each new obstacle. In Lanius, he found his hammer.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
surprise|The bots have enough firepower to arm a full platoon.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
disgust|Have you seen this tribe? If it's not an epic drunken ballad of cracking skulls and hearing lamentations they think it's a waste of time.
neutral|See you around.
anger|You don't wanna do that, baby - not without hearing what I got to say first.
joy|I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
neutral|Antony took Sergeant Teddy away and gave him to the stinky dogs. I want him back!
anger|I doubt I can help you. I'm just a kid, you know.
neutral|Look, I already told Chomps that the NCR's getting suspicious of all these "misplaced" supplies. Bigger risk means bigger cost - 300 caps bigger.
anger|Goddamn it. This wasn't supposed to be a guess. She might not have done a goddamn thing.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
fear|This old man's retreating, boss!
joy|Whoa! Are you like... some kind of crazy person?
neutral|I need you to take everything we've found to Chief Hanlon and confront him with it. I don't want to make this public unless we have to.
joy|Janet will be paid what she's owed. Consider it a gift.
neutral|Damn right. You and I, we're just a couple of problem solvers.
joy|The initial reports have come back already. Excellent work. This will buy us a lot of breathing room to get back on our feet here.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
anger|The man was brutally beaten, and only barely survived. My superiors ordered the relief mission scrapped.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
surprise|Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
neutral|Carla's dead. That's all you need to know.
neutral|Our chief at the time, mountain of a guy named Bingo, wanted to stay nomadic. I disagreed, so he challenged me to the knife.
joy|I'm glad to see you.
fear|Careful!
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
joy|You're a class act, baby. Not to say I'm gonna make it easy for you...
neutral|Yes, it would be, we can't have outsiders running around using our technology.
surprise|Found you!
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
fear|I don't know what you've been smoking, but where can I get some?
surprise|Glad that fucker House is gone.
anger|Make it quick, I've got a shitstorm to deal with due to the damn monorail being blown up.
neutral|The Scorpions hang out at the Monte Carlo when they aren't slinging chems or getting their heads blown off by the Fiends.
neutral|That's nice, honey, but no thanks.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|And that's really not what the Brotherhood needs right now anyway. They're hanging by a thread.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|And whose idea was it to offer yourself up as a sacrificial lamb? Really, what did you expect?
neutral|Oh, I'm not. I'm making my way to New Vegas. They say anything goes there, and best of all, the NCR can't mess it up for you.
sadness|As I told you, Carlitos was the only thing that kept me alive in this place. Now, I just don't know what'll happen.
neutral|Nightkin have a hard time being seen like normal folks. Can't stand it. A few already left to try and find more Stealth Boys.
anger|These troops did a good job holding off the Legion. Now it's time to fight back.
anger|Mr. House hides Vegas under his skirt when the bombs fall a thousand years ago, so it belongs to him? Forever? You buy that?
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
neutral|If that's how it is, there's not a lot of comfort in knowing it.
sadness|Better move along, there's not much for you here.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
surprise|Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
joy|My request is perfectly reasonable. Give us the Stealth Boy specs and there will be no need for us to splatter the room with your insides.
neutral|Freeside: Idolized.
anger|What the hell?!
neutral|Thanks, that'll help.
disgust|Better not try that again.
surprise|The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
neutral|Yeah, maybe they'll think twice about engaging the NCR if they know one of those could be floating around.
anger|East it is. Reports also say that they might have some NCR hostages. If that's true we need to do what we can to save them. So stay sharp.
joy|Really? Oh, I wasn't expecting you to agree so easily. That's great!
neutral|Kimball rose to prominence as the "Hero of the Mojave" when he led a campaign of reprisals against tribals who dared to attack NCR citizens.
sadness|Sergeant Teddy!
neutral|It was all wrong, though. Women, kids, elderly. Wounded started coming through, too.
joy|This one's a haiku.
anger|It's a game, and games have winners and losers. I prefer the former, how about you?
neutral|When, after several months we found and surrounded the Hidebarks' camp, their Chieftain raised a banner of surrender.
neutral|All right, ladies, show's over.
anger|This fool challenges the Legion, brothers! Let us teach him some manners!
surprise|Wish I could've seen what's inside the 38.
anger|Our main target is the Legion leader at Nelson. Intel has the commander as one Dead Sea. I've uploaded his last known location to your Pip-Boy.
joy|The crowd loves your bravery.
anger|All right, fellas. Let's get out of this shit hole.
joy|We're hanging in there. Things wouldn't be so bad if we could actually get some reinforcements or supplies, but we'll just have to survive for now.
joy|I never thought I'd see the day when the NCR and the Kings started getting along.
joy|I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
joy|I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
joy|That's what I like about you. You follow orders, for the most part. Just remember to wait for the signal.
neutral|They live in pitiful squalor, undisciplined, intemperate. To enslave them is to save them - to give them purpose, and virtue.
sadness|Won't ever make enough to live outside.
anger|Yeah, a bunch of those Legion fucks dragged them off right away. They was headed East, if you're feeling heroic.
anger|I got nothing, here.
neutral|I don't know how she managed to get a hold of a female Deathclaw, but she kept it in a shed. Aunt Rose had a steady supply of eggs for her omelets.
anger|Don't make any trouble for us, we won't make any trouble for you.
neutral|Hidden Valley is the place to keep working, then.
sadness|We've been out here on the front lines for a long time without any reinforcements or resupplies. That's what I need your help for.
anger|I don't know who you think you're kidding. I've lived here for more than a year.
neutral|Freeside: Wild Child.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|You got a real sick sense of humor.
surprise|Found you!
anger|Tell you what - I'll call Benny, keep him away from his suite. You go search the place. Here's the key, it's on the 13th floor.
joy|Thanks for finding my lucky helmet. It's my favorite!
joy|House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
neutral|Good riddance. We've had reports for years that they're the ones who supply the Fiends with chems, but no one's done anything about it.
neutral|Even if we hadn't blocked the river to prevent the Legion from coming at us from the south, that'd be absurd.
joy|Have you seen these elite rangers they sent us from California? God damn those boys are gonna kick some ass!
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
fear|You're not part of my unit... no, you're here for the money! I told the Omertas I was good for it!
joy|After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
joy|I'm not willing to let that happen, and I don't think you're the kind of person that would either.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
neutral|Beef prices around the New Vegas Strip have dropped significantly following an agreement between the Ultra-Luxe and Brahmin baron Heck Gunderson.
disgust|Good, get lost.
disgust|Filthy lowlife scum!
anger|The Legion knows nothing of working the land. Those folks would rather pillage, burn and steal, like mad beasts. That ain't honest living.
surprise|All right, I have to admit I wasn't expecting you to say that. I was just joking. But if it makes you feel any better, I am impressed.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
neutral|Your history of aggression towards the NCR has rendered you useless in this concern, unable to influence the outcome of events.
anger|What do you need?
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
neutral|Later.
anger|What have you done?
surprise|Your higher brain functions are off the charts. The implant won't help at all - sorry.
neutral|Well, if you can get me most of it, I could give you a loan for the rest.
disgust|If you're sure... your loss. Can't say I couldn't use a break from you for a while.
joy|See, that wasn't so bad. Anything else I can do for you?
neutral|Well, I suppose I don't care much, either. At least not enough to turn down an offer for help.
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
joy|I won't be missing Mr. House, that's a given. The Strip's better off without him.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
joy|Groovetastic. Tell him it's on his tab.
surprise|Bears taking over twisty track. Voices unsure of this.
joy|You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
anger|That's right, gimme another!
anger|Look out!
neutral|They've got an old monorail that still runs between them. Used mostly for supplies and deployment. But if you get leave you're allowed to go gamble.
anger|We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
neutral|It's not too late to change his mind.
anger|I can't believe President Kimball is dead... the last thing we needed around here was another morale hit.
fear|The ground in Forlorn Hope was soaked red, from the blood of our own people!
anger|No!
disgust|It was heaven - until you find that all the glitter is made of broken dreams and all the praise hides a knife pointing at your ribs.
neutral|Those costs will change depending on your choice of fighters. Also, I'll only allow fair fights in The Thorn.
joy|They knew all kinds of kooky scientastical stuff, so I ate up all the chemistry they could teach. Diane had the head for business, so we teamed up.
fear|Make it quick. We don't have much time.
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
fear|I don't want to die!
neutral|Mercy killing is a last resort. Glad you recognized we had options.
surprise|You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
neutral|Good point. Anyway, it's your hide. Guess I should take all the help I can get.
disgust|Not much to tell. Typical gang of dumb bullies and angry nobodies. They're holed up a bit south of here, in the Monte Carlo Suites.
neutral|I think I need to go home.
anger|What have you done?
neutral|Here, I don't have much left at this point. Please, just tell me where they are.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|I'll be honest, the Legion has me worried here, but I think I can spare some soldiers. Consider your request granted.
surprise|House was on to me from word Go? I thought I was being so clever...
neutral|Absolutely not! Caesar is of great use to me.
neutral|If you want me to stick around, that ends now. I don't care what the reasons are, I will not help the Legion. Ever. Got it?
joy|I can't wait to see what fights next.
joy|Thanks.
joy|I may have taken the torch part more literally than they intended.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
neutral|And go where? According to you, the road west is blocked. And while you might let us by, I highly doubt your allies will do the same.
fear|That guy's got cold eyes. Definitely ex-military.
anger|You dirty coward!
neutral|Don't expect to hold this place for very long, however. The NCR will be back.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
surprise|Bear heads in pain. Chip cannot help them.
anger|Alright, fine, but you gotta bring us those suits first.
anger|What was that for?
joy|Do you believe there are folks who'd pay 500 caps for a steak dinner? Over at the Ultra-Luxe! Honest!
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
fear|A group of us want to leave, go back to the NCR and surrender. But Cooke won't let us.
joy|The tour showcases REPCONN's amazing scientific contributions, and the promise of many more, coupled with its parent company, RobCo.
anger|Might want to watch it there, boss.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
fear|I hope my dad doesn't find out how much money those hookers cost me.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
disgust|They think they're tough, but any time they tangle with the Fiends, they get torn right up.
fear|Mercy!
fear|You're not going to cause any problems, right?
neutral|Those who can afford passports are saying the added security is well worth the price of admission.
neutral|I swear the monorail was *just* ahead... somewhere.
anger|You think I really care about the money? I just... no, no, no!
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
surprise|Aha!
sadness|Oh no! Alice... Alice, baby! I'm sorry, so sorry...
neutral|Mr. Gunderson is no longer a welcome guest at the Ultra-Luxe.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
anger|These patients were gravely injured. It's not a joking matter!
anger|You're just in time for your ass whipping.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
anger|This is going to be loud, sweetie!
joy|I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
surprise|Really? Thank you so much! I'll get going right away.
fear|Oh, well, that's all just a big misunderstanding, see.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
neutral|You've got my ear.
anger|What have you done?
anger|Pushed me too far.
neutral|Well, the Far Go Traders have been trying to edge us out on the new armor contract for the troops. This could swing things in our favor.
disgust|I hear "dig" from you, babe, and all I can think of is a shovel. How can this be? This ain't forgiveness, it's something... wrong.
anger|True to Caesar.
anger|I should make you pay for your crimes!
surprise|Huh?
neutral|Now go, and teach what you've learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
neutral|Goodsprings: Wild Child.
disgust|What? I only talk to Captain Curtis over at McCarran. I would never work with slavers. Honest.
surprise|Hey!
joy|You and me gonna accomplish great things, baby.
fear|Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
joy|More than you ever dreamed, baby.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
fear|I've got a friend stationed at McCarran - I heard something about a monorail explosion there. I hope he's okay.
anger|Look out!
neutral|Are you a child? The Platinum Chip was taken from you, obviously.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
joy|I heard you helped destroy the Legion at Nelson. Thanks!
joy|This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
neutral|I'll be waiting.
anger|Flank 'em!
joy|Howdy, come try your luck? I hope's on your side.
joy|Man, I love my guns.
fear|So what happens now?
neutral|Keep your heads down and move up to the next location.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
surprise|Put that down!
surprise|Found you!
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
neutral|I guess we'll have to.  If Caesar's Legion drives the NCR from the area, there goes ninety percent of our business.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
anger|Had enough?
sadness|The surface world is a cruel place.
neutral|Great Khans: Shunned.
joy|so if you would screw her, beware it.
surprise|Grenade!
joy|After we got out, I talked him into settling down here. So, here we are.
neutral|Something the politicians back in Shady Sands came up with. They pay us to move here and farm the land. They even protect the fields.
sadness|Cool. Maybe later.
fear|Who the hell are you? They bring you in to replace me? They're replacing me, aren't they?
surprise|Hey, stranger! Where have you been, uh? I missed you!
fear|Medicine's running low again.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
surprise|Guns? I, uh, well... yeah, I guess I might have a few.
neutral|Thank you. What happened was regrettable, but I'll make sure it never happens again.
joy|Okay! You know where to go. See you soon!
neutral|Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
joy|The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
anger|I was pressured into posting young Henry as the manager of the New Vegas branch. As you can see, he wasn't exactly cut out for the job.
anger|You dirty coward!
joy|Thank you, that was very helpful. I don't think I'll need those books after all.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
disgust|As you wish; I'm sure the optimal solution will become apparent to you in time.
fear|The ground in Forlorn Hope was soaked red, from the blood of our own people!
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
anger|I never trusted those Omerta punks, even if I like their girls.
neutral|Before he left, Nero told me him and Big Sal were real tired, see? Said they were gonna go camping up at Lake Mead.
fear|Well, maybe I can give him a chance.
fear|Don't... do anything to me, okay?
joy|Here you go. Enjoy it.
neutral|Really? I had no idea. And here I've been carrying them all this time, never knowing how dangerous they were.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
surprise|Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
anger|Then what the hell are you doing down here? Get back topside and protect the president!
anger|I have a personal message for you from Uncle Sam!
surprise|Found you!
surprise|Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
joy|Mr. House won't trouble our plans for the Strip any longer, huh!?
neutral|Anything else?
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|In exchange for your help, you would receive complete amnesty for any past crimes against the NCR, as well as additional benefits and perks.
anger|What the hell?!
fear|Red Rock Canyon isn't exactly the most hospitable place - there's no food, barely any water, and nothing anybody wants.
joy|Now that you've killed that Caesar bastard, the Strip's really going to bloom!
anger|Cool by me if you wanna talk after all... but a confab like this, out in public, in my place of business? That don't play.
disgust|You bastard!
neutral|He'll never listen unless I hold the proof right in front of his face.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
joy|I'm glad you could make it! I have something that I wanted to discuss with you.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
neutral|Certainly. What would you like to know?
fear|I wouldn't mind this so much if it weren't for that maniacal gleam in your eye.
joy|...and going, the same folks, but now they're losers who'll trade you the shirt off their backs so they don't starve before they make it back home.
surprise|You've taken down Cazadores! Didn't think I'd ever see that.
surprise|I've never seen so many pretty lights in my life.
surprise|Do I look like a seamstress to you? Those boomsters can stay in their nowhereville until the sun runs out of gas, for all I care. No deal.
anger|I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
joy|There's nothing else like The Thorn!
joy|When I get back home, I'll tell everyone I met you.
anger|That's mine!
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
neutral|I'm afraid I can't do this for free. My supplies are stretched thin enough as it is.
joy|Good to see a friend of our government.
joy|I've got the Chip, but to see this shin-dig through to the end? I'm gonna need help. And hello! Who shows up but you?
neutral|No... this has to end now.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
surprise|Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
fear|Stop it! Help!
anger|I don't want to talk about this, didn't you hear? Now, get lost before we run you off the hard way.
joy|You're all set. Are we done here?
joy|I've got this recipe for a Deathclaw Omelet that I've been itching to try out. Trouble is - I need a Deathclaw egg. Kinda obvious, I suppose.
neutral|You may bear Caesar's mark, but do not attempt to share any of your medicine with anyone in The Fort.
anger|We have no men or supplies and we're stretched too thin trying to guard the entire river.
anger|What have you done?
sadness|Can you spare some caps, mister?
neutral|They stood and hoped their turn would not come. Each cared only for himself.
joy|You can't hide from me.
joy|The Legion has won a great victory over the NCR at a place called Forlorn Hope.
joy|Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
anger|We'll get 'em.
disgust|Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
joy|I heard you've been helping out Quartermaster Mayes. I appreciate it, we need all the help we can get around here.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
joy|One of New Vegas' finest! You are always welcome in the Strip.
anger|You will be avenged, Brother.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|Caps it is. Will there be anything else?
joy|I'm afraid I'm a very lethal killing machine.
surprise|Can you imagine how much electricity it takes to keep this Vault running?
anger|No!
joy|Baby, the meet and greet we scheduled in the Presidential? The whole point is to explain why I can't hand the Chip over.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
surprise|Huh?
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
surprise|Found you!
neutral|Like what?
neutral|This better not be about the meaning of life.
neutral|Sorry, I may be little, but I'm not dumb.
joy|Cooke left the vault, good thing too he was going to get us all killed.
joy|We haven't met yet. You must be new in town. I'm Andy.
surprise|Caravan companies are probably your best bet. Smaller traders aren't likely to have anything that esoteric.
neutral|Dismissed.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
neutral|Good day to you, and stay out of trouble.
neutral|We were crossing the Mojave, not far from Searchlight, when a band of Caesar's Legion slavers came out of nowhere. They took my family.
anger|I don't know what Razz gave us, but holy shit this is great! I feel like I could kill an entire legion! With my teeth!
surprise|Aha!
joy|NCR should take this chance, now that Mr. House's out of the way.
joy|Thank God. Please tell me you're here to relieve me.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
sadness|And I sure hope you're more convincing than I am, or they ain't gonna listen.
anger|Get out here! Not done with you!
anger|What?
joy|Please, lower your weapon and submit.
sadness|I hear more troops are gathering at Hoover Dam. Things are probably going to get pretty messy over there real soon.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
anger|I should make you pay for your crimes!
surprise|Wish I could've seen what's inside the 38.
neutral|Novac: Accepted.
surprise|I'm not sure what's going on with the Misfits - their accuracy is in the toilet, but they're spoiling for a fight like I ain't never seen.
anger|Blaaagghhh.
surprise|Weird, someone just told me that the Khans split the Vegas area. Wonder where they went, and why.
joy|Papa can be a stubborn man, but he's not a tyrant. He listens to his tribe, and to four voices in particular: me, Jack and Diane, and Melissa.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
surprise|Huh?
neutral|I suppose you've given me no reason not to trust you. Fine, take the data and go. I hope you know what you're doing.
anger|Look out!
joy|Private Sexton was thinking of having a contest to see who can kill the most Legion. I wonder if he ever got that going.
disgust|Oh, good, the boss is murdering people now. Excellent.
sadness|This place's got a weird gloom after Miss Weintraub died.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|So long.
anger|You will be avenged, Brother.
disgust|Not much to tell, really. I grew up in New Reno, joined up, took my shot at being a Ranger. Didn't make it, so I'm stuck with this crew of jokers.
anger|That damn Mr. House has forbid any NCR military personnel from carrying any sort of firearms on the Strip. Well, except for Captain Pappas.
neutral|Of course, a Deathclaw egg from anywhere will do. According to my Aunt Rose, those things have a ridiculously long shelf life.
sadness|Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
joy|The orders for service rifles and ammunition have been pouring in from McCarran so fast we can't keep up. Hell of a fight is coming.
anger|Before, just going to kill you. But now, going to kill you real bad!
neutral|Better that than simply give up. What other option is available? Retreat?
surprise|Word is the Khans signed a treaty with the NCR. Never saw that coming.
surprise|House? More like House light. I heard he got himself unplugged.
surprise|They're here! Don't let them get the antidote! Oh. It's just you. You can't have it either.
neutral|And for that reason it's all the more important that the Followers walk the wastes to remind people of them.
anger|You hear the losers around here complaining how they lost their shirts on the Strip? It's pathetic.
neutral|Sounds like I don't have much choice.
neutral|I tried to buy him, just so they'd stop hurting him, but they didn't want any of it.
neutral|He said that no one pays attention to him, even with his brahmin. Anderson and I argued, but eventually we decided to let him go ahead with it.
anger|Get away from me, you lunatic!
surprise|Holy shit!
disgust|What the... what the hell are you talking about?
surprise|Anything is possible, but that's unlikely.
neutral|If you say so... you know these collars have a bomb in them, don't you?
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
surprise|Hello! It was you, wiped out the Khans down in Boulder City? You did that? Oh shit.
joy|Well. Sure! You seem pretty special. But that will be our secret, okay?
disgust|Washed a hundred times, Brahmin smell never gets out.
neutral|The Office of Science and Industry has carefully calculated the amount of water needed for these crops. The whole thing is handled by computer.
anger|Tangle with the Gun Runners and it's the last thing you'll do.
fear|Oh God help us!
joy|Thank you. We'll wait here until we hear from you.
joy|I hope we can still be friends when this is all over.
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
surprise|Whoa!
joy|Now we're talking.
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
joy|I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
joy|Well, well. If it isn't the courier who wiped out the Legion over at Nelson. Good to see you around the Hope.
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
joy|I heard. The extra supplies will help for a short time, but that only solves one of our problems.
neutral|More tracks. Coming your way. Right now.
sadness|This won't get us Hoover Dam.
anger|We have to get the President out of here now. I'll cancel the speech and have security search the area.
neutral|Hey, I'm all for being a hero when the time is right, but there are at least 12 of those bastards lurking around in here.
neutral|You mean it? Wow, thanks!
surprise|Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
anger|Join the Great Khans, what the hell is Cooke thinking?
neutral|We've got a pair of Giant Mantises ready to bleed.
neutral|You're shitting me. You got a real offer, or are you just going to waste my time?
surprise|Found you!
anger|No, no I don't think you will. The deal is final.
neutral|In any case... this is an employer - employee relationship. I've given you an assignment, and the directions are clear.
joy|House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
anger|I didn't come all the way out here just so we could save the fucking NCR. I'm out.
neutral|Primm: Accepted.
anger|Ask your questions, but keep it short.
anger|Die, Profligate!
joy|The NCR could use someone like you. Stop by our camps if you're looking for work.
surprise|I'm going to make them shape up if it kills me, though. Or them, for that matter.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
neutral|No, this needs to end. I'm tired of running and living like scavengers.
disgust|You motherless bastard. You'll pay for this!
sadness|It was gonna be something. If I'd never met Carla, it would've been something else. I should've never gotten close to her.
disgust|You bastard!
neutral|Yeah, whatever.
anger|This operation has cost me plenty. I ain't about to get shaken down by some Johnny-come-lately.
neutral|What, we leaving *already?*
neutral|VStoryEventLucky38Relit set to 1.
neutral|Transplanting this brain will make Rex faster than he was before.
joy|Here are some caps for your trouble. You've done us a great service.
neutral|We're always looking for new members. Does he have any particular talent?
joy|The Followers are lucky to have a friend like you.
anger|Go ahead and laugh, baby. I ain't blind to the humor in this situation.
surprise|Whatever.
sadness|It's no problem, just something I'd rather not think about. Now, I should get to the other customers.
surprise|These bots now have eyes on their backs, I swear!
neutral|VStoryEventCaesarMeetsPlayer set to 1.
anger|Well hurry the fuck up, I don't wanna wait all day.
anger|Private Erwin... he's starting to get a thick file here with all his troublemaking.
sadness|I just wish I had the equipment and supplies to handle the number of injuries we have here.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
neutral|If it turns out to be a dud, it'd show how flawed our goals have been. Father Elijah said he thinks a scavenger might have sold it on the Strip.
neutral|Well I have a bomb here that can be put on the vertibird that will detonate at a certain altitude, but it's a little unstable and dangerous.
neutral|All right, we've got a deal then. I'll make sure to compensate you for your time, if you find anything useful.
neutral|Zone clear! Advance to the next position.
disgust|Jesus, I can't even believe it. After all House did to set us up with this swank joint. I don't suppose there's more?
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
joy|You can't hide from me.
fear|Also, I might have... umm... sort of... plowed his daughter. A little.
joy|Lady Luck's on your side. I hope some of that rubs off on me, Caesar killer!
anger|What do you want to know?
disgust|I didn't expect to see you here. I hope you're not here to cause trouble.
anger|You heard the lady, people, get focused!
sadness|I heard from Dr. Richards. Too bad you weren't able to help him with anything, but we all can't be doctors.
anger|Things are still pretty damn rough, but we're keeping it together.
joy|Do you believe there are folks who'd pay 500 caps for a steak dinner? Over at the Ultra-Luxe! Honest!
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
neutral|If you can believe it, things are even worse back home. The whole city's still run by crime families. Used to be the Mordinos and Wrights.
disgust|Couldn't you tell? That damn radiation bomb got me. I can't serve the NCR like this...
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
anger|I swear, I could kill you right now and never look back.
anger|Come on!
neutral|They're my blood, man. You don't just walk away from your blood!
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
anger|Hooker, customer, it doesn't matter. Everyone here's a pawn to the Omertas, playing and dying by their rules.
joy|You've managed to become extraordinarily well-liked by the top brass. You should exploit that for your own gain wherever possible.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
fear|This isn't like the sims!
neutral|VStoryEventRacket set to 0.
sadness|I'm a nobody. Just a survivor. Things were well enough until the NCR threw me behind bars.
sadness|It was more like... being forced to watch something you can't stop.
joy|We get 'em coming and going. Coming, the suckers flush with caps they saved to gamble on the Strip...
anger|Back off.
anger|One of those beasts cut my friend in half! How the hell did they escape from Red Lucy?
disgust|Suffice to say I'm a certified genius, and when I'm discharged from this pit of testosterone and failure, I'll have all the money I could ever need.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
anger|I should kill you myself for what you did to Kimball, and fuck the law!
surprise|The Kings got hit hard. I don't know how many of them are still alive, if any.
neutral|Check your weapons and move up!
joy|I kinda like being a farmer.
neutral|It's not polite to leave in the middle of a conversation, but I won't try to teach you manners. This time.
fear|Fight!
joy|I've heard of your fights at The Thorn. People down here don't stop talking about you.
surprise|Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
joy|So, our President's savior is enjoying a well deserved R&R? Fine piece of work you are!
joy|I'm so much happier now. Thank you again.
joy|Since you have some medical experience, I'd like you to examine them and see what you can do to treat them.
joy|After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
neutral|You ever change your mind, I'll be right there with you.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
anger|No confession? No evidence? What good is that?
anger|
disgust|Good, now get going.
anger|I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
anger|What do you need?
neutral|Unfortunately, I'll need to run the test on a live subject, and Marcus has encouraged me to investigate the Nightstalker mutation first.
anger|We Followers aren't pushovers!
neutral|Sure enough, you got me clear of this mess. Here you go.
surprise|Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
neutral|Dynamite or grenades?
surprise|Aha!
neutral|So you're the one Colonel Moore sent to help out with the President's visit. Well, I'm running security for the visit, which means I'm in charge.
surprise|Head voices see clouds in the sky. Where is sun?
anger|You gotta piss someone off to pull guard duty out here.
joy|You making a pass at me, sister? Because I'm out of your league.
joy|I can be pretty sneaky when I need to be, and the prison guards were a joke.
anger|Do you have no respect for private property, you slimy little commie bastard?
anger|Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
sadness|Those were good men at the station. Good men. This whole town was sleeping a lot easier because of them.
disgust|Everybody has to do it. Well, everybody who wants to be a Khan, anyways. They toss you into the ring there and beat on you for a solid minute.
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
neutral|I'd like to play something special for you right now. Because you deserve it.
neutral|Execute them.
anger|What have you done?
neutral|I want to see how different groups have adapted to survive in the Mojave. See if there's something I can learn from.
surprise|Whoa!
neutral|NCR officials at Camp McCarran were relieved when technical difficulties with its monorail line to the New Vegas Strip proved easy to fix.
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
joy|Confident, I like that.
anger|We're supplying things people want in exchange for things our tribe needs. Don't judge us.
disgust|Filthy lowlife scum!
joy|I hear Caesar's dead, and we've got you to thank for it. Nice work.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
anger|You'll pay for what you did to our soldiers at Forlorn Hope, murderer!
anger|Well ain't you a sentimental broad? Gimme a sec to jump off Cloud 9, I'll meet you on the ground...
fear|Get away from me! I don't want to get shot!
anger|They knew when to come and what route to take, and they only took Carla. Someone set it up. I don't know who.
surprise|Never seen a guardian dog like that before.
neutral|You've got yourself a deal.
joy|That bad huh? Well at least I tried. The actual idea is better. It's a Legion hunt. Whoever kills the most wins. How about it?
fear|I really don't have anything you'd want.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
joy|I never thought I'd see the day when the NCR and the Kings started getting along.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
joy|At least this way the badasses with the top-shelf guns are on my side.
neutral|Lupa? Yes, she's the mother of a lot of our best dogs. She's getting old, but she's still a tough old bitch. Aren't you, girl?
anger|I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
joy|After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
surprise|Who is Private Edwards?
sadness|Those were good men at the station. Good men. This whole town was sleeping a lot easier because of them.
neutral|It's a good bet that the Legion is going to try something today so we have to be prepared for anything.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
surprise|Wait... what? Why would he do that?
neutral|Then I wish you luck, and good hunting.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
surprise|Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
joy|I'm glad to see you.
sadness|He's the reason the Strip shines like a star at night. Mike's imagined and built every sign, billboard and light you'll see around here.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|That would be worth knowing, especially if we can then rearm and reuse them.
anger|Wish the Followers would get me some better armor.
neutral|Conversely, his failure to annex the Mojave these seven years, and the immense costs of occupying a foreign land, have eroded his popular support.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
joy|So the Major has you running errands for him. Well, we're short on personnel as well as supplies so we'll take all the help we can get.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
surprise|The owner of the Vault was murdered. I thought we were safe inside the Strip.
joy|Caesar on the cross, been a long time since I've seen the kind of work you've laid down today... a damn long time.
anger|Maybe if their situations improved, they'd have men to spare. Or maybe they'd listen to someone with a reputation for helping the NCR.
anger|That's mine!
surprise|Yeah, to die in my sleep at a ripe old age after a marathon session of hey-hey with thirty sex-starved broads. You'll set that up?
anger|I'll kill you for that!
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
joy|Can I help you with anything else?
joy|Then I can't help you. Sorry.
surprise|Hey!
surprise|The tables turned for Mr. House. What next, huh?
neutral|Born and raised. Things back in California are better than they've ever been, according to my grandpa.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
anger|I took one of their envoys to the Ridgers' village and showed him the corpse piles.
neutral|Uhh, hey. Welcome to Red Rock Canyon. You've seemed a little bipolar lately - maybe you're having withdrawal symptoms?
joy|Back again? Did you miss me?
joy|Allright! I won't turn down a freebie. Shit, these days I almost can't pay my own in this two-faced, goddamn city any more.
neutral|Elder McNamara wouldn't shell out for a passport for me, so I've actually never been to the Strip. Why do people get so cheap when they get old?
neutral|All I ask is that you recover the Chip. What happens to Benny is up to you.
neutral|Tin cans, gunpowder, scrap metal, and duct tape? We won't have any trouble finding those ingredients!
anger|Return to me when you've destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel.
disgust|Consider yourself lucky.
joy|A friend of mine at the Dam says President Kimball might visit the troops out there. Imagine shaking the president's hand!
sadness|I had hoped to become a great doctor like you someday.
anger|Whatever. Not like I need any of them. I do just fine on my own.
anger|Sorry excuses?.. That's does it! Tell Mr. House to hire a better artist, if he can find one in this barren wasteland!
surprise|You've beat Night Stalkers, right? We don't see that often down here.
neutral|A little bit ago one of the intake towers got clogged. No water running through it anymore to spin the generators.
surprise|All hell broke loose when the creatures escaped from The Thorn!
anger|What the hell?!
neutral|VStoryEventKhans set to 2.
anger|You're not exactly making friends around here, are you?
disgust|Oh good. Mines.
anger|You dirty coward!
surprise|House? More like House light. I heard he got himself unplugged.
surprise|I can't believe the King is dead. What's going to happen to us now?
anger|Fat's in the fire now, you little bitch.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
anger|You better start thinking about it soon, we're on a limited time schedule.
joy|I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
anger|There's also the matter of Henry Jamison, an employee whose services I'd rather do without. His family connections make it difficult, however.
disgust|Come back when you actually have the money, you damn junkie.
anger|That's stealing!
surprise|The Great Khans tribe went mad. During the battle at the Dam, they attacked both the Legion and the NCR.
joy|That's exactly what we needed to put a cork in that camp. The Legion won't be moving through there anytime soon.
sadness|Maybe when this is all over, they'll find time to look after us.
fear|You killed him! What have we done to you?
anger|Look out!
anger|Look out!
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
anger|We will find you!
joy|Maybe you're right. Maybe I can find my true calling, someplace they'll appreciate my poetry! Someplace like the Old Mormon Fort, maybe.
fear|It's all right, I guess. I don't like all the fighting we gotta do, though.
neutral|VStoryEventHanlon set to 1.
neutral|What do you want to know?
joy|All right! See you soon.
anger|Then stay off the line and get back to work!
anger|Fucking Mr. House was holding the cards the whole goddamn time. Him and his little errand boy.
joy|Did you need anything else?
joy|So you're the bigshot that Caesar put in charge of this mission. I've heard about you. You've got quite the reputation already.
neutral|Vulpes is the best of my Frumentarii. A remarkable individual from an unremarkable tribe south of the Utah.
neutral|What? No, he... what do you mean, aren't allowed to serve? Why would he lie about that?
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
anger|Some drunk girls thought it would be fun to play in the fountain in front of the Ultra-Luxe. Now I need to clean up the mess.
anger|We ain't here to help you, get out.
joy|He and I had joined up with the same caravan. Add in a lot of whiskey, and, well, let's just say we got to know each other.
fear|Don't do that, baby, not crucifixion. I could be up there for days with those twisted creeps laughing and pointing.
disgust|Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
neutral|You're right. You won't.
joy|I hope you're doing well, friend!
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
anger|Grrrraah!
joy|Don't know about you, but this beats herding Brahmin back in California.
surprise|What? You want me to turn myself in?
joy|You can't hide from me.
surprise|Aha!
surprise|Ironically, I was born a Profligate myself, a citizen of the NCR.
anger|Alexander doesn't pay me to talk.
neutral|Here's your chip. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|It's quiet out here. We like to keep it that way.
surprise|Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
surprise|The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
neutral|What happened with Chief Hanlon?
anger|Our envoy was brutally beaten, and only barely survived. My superiors ordered the relief mission scrapped.
fear|Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
neutral|See you around.
neutral|Sure.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
joy|Okay, lay down and I'll take care of you.
disgust|What?
joy|Wait for me in the Presidential suite. We got a future together, you and me. It's time we got started.
joy|The fight is to the death. It keeps them from getting complacent.
joy|Hot damn do I love this place.
anger|Think I didn't see that?
anger|We Followers aren't pushovers!
joy|That's nice. I suspect we'll stick around here, though. Business has been good.
joy|Tell you what, you see any good acts while you're out wandering, give them my card. If they work out, I'll give you a 3% cut of the door.
anger|What makes you think I give a damn about you?
joy|There's a ranger station north of here that has a few ghouls running it. Maybe they'll take him in.
anger|Yeah. What they do to women... that's worse than death. There was no choice in what I did.
disgust|Win? I wasn't aware we were competing.
joy|If you ever need the assistance of the Followers, just ask.
sadness|Sorry to hear that. Do me a favor and give it some more thought. I'll be here if you change your mind.
anger|Hey, that's not yours!
neutral|Of course, dearie. I know it's dangerous, but it'll all turn out for the best, you'll see. I'll go to him now - it would be rude to keep him waiting!
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
anger|Grrrraah!
neutral|That's the PHOENIX Monocyte Breeder. The implant speeds up cell regeneration, an effect similar to that of some lizards and sea creatures.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
fear|I'm not a threat to anyone!
joy|If you ever need the assistance of the Followers, just ask.
surprise|Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
surprise|Hey!
surprise|Aha!
joy|Looks like this is my lucky day.
joy|I hope Red Lucy gives us the *big* monsters, next.
anger|You dirty coward!
fear|Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
fear|I'll tell you what I think, I think I oughta go tell Benny about this right now - but I'll clam up for now.
neutral|I'm not giving up. He wants evidence, but he'll never go looking for it. He's scared I'm right.
joy|Time to make some new friends.
surprise|Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
sadness|Maybe when this is all over, they'll find time to look after us.
anger|Alexander doesn't pay me to talk.
neutral|The 188's north on the 95, good for all kinds of trade. Not much south on 95 unless you turn west on 164 to Nipton, right off the rail line.
surprise|Mars *eclipsing* bears. Bulls come soon.
anger|So, let's see it, stranger. Do you know yourself?
surprise|Whoa!
joy|Yeah it was bad. I'll leave the comedy alone. So how about it?
anger|My problem? My problem is we're all going to die.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
joy|I heard that some of the NCR Rangers are on their way to help us out. We'll make short work of the Legion with their help.
anger|Yeah, thought so. You're a smart kid, you know that?
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
neutral|... I... I was blind to what was happening in my own family. We don't have much, but please take this.
disgust|You're slowing down. Pick it up!
anger|That's not a good idea.
neutral|You're already quite charming. The Empathy Synthesizer would just be a waste of caps, I'm afraid.
anger|Get 'em, boss! I mean, if that fits with your schedule.
fear|Now if you'll excuse me, I need a moment to collect myself.
joy|Another satisfied customer.
joy|The crowds are waiting for you, stranger. Show us your best.
disgust|Suit yourself.
joy|Just don't rob me, and I'll do it!
sadness|I guess I wanted to make something of myself, you know? Be the best of the best. I *wanted* to be a ranger, but... guess this is as close as I get.
neutral|Caesar's Legion: Idolized.
neutral|I have my orders, and they explicitly state that I am to divide my men.
neutral|Wait until you see the encampment, how massive it is. And a personal audience with mighty Caesar - glorious!
anger|You want some of this?
anger|I hate it here, fucking sulfur stinks.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
sadness|Rest in peace, Brother.
neutral|Here's your NCR money. Will there be anything else?
anger|All right, fellas. Let's get out of this shit hole.
fear|You're bluffing, baby... Except maybe you're not.
disgust|I think I'll take my chances with the wasteland.
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
joy|Fuck that Caesar dog! I'm going to drink in your name, all night!
disgust|I've got a bad feeling about this....
neutral|Preliminary word is that Caesar's Legion has taken control of the Dam, and that the NCR presence in Nevada is severely crippled.
anger|Flank 'em!
neutral|We'd never pursue it because it's not a weapon. But self-sufficiency is fundamental to us. If it works they'd see the value of an alternate course.
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
joy|Have you seen what one of those anti-materiel rifles can do to a Deathclaw?
neutral|Thank you for doing what you can. I won't let this go to waste.
anger|Just keep on walking.
neutral|Vale, as you wish. My orders are to wait here until you're ready to make the trip.
neutral|Good thing I'm still alive, then.
anger|Damn!
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
joy|You serve the Legion well, amicus.
anger|Had enough?
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
anger|Don't talk to me!
sadness|I know I seem kind of young. I was the apprentice Keeper of the Story until a couple months ago, but ol' Keeper Don, well...
joy|
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
neutral|Westside, huh? I hope the NCR does something about those thieving bastards. I appreciate it, and so do the rest of the farmers.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
joy|We have cities of our own, but nothing compared to Vegas. Finally, my Legion will have its Rome.
neutral|That's okay, I wouldn't expect anybody to. I think they tend to keep to themselves.
neutral|In addition, they've managed to beat back our men emerging from the intake tower ahead and secure it.
anger|This job's boring enough without talking to you. Go see Alexander.
joy|Good to see a friend of our government.
neutral|That said, if you were to strike at the Profligates, butcher them, trouble their operations... this will not go unnoticed.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
neutral|The HELIOS One solar power plant remains dormant despite NCR efforts to reactivate the facility.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
anger|How do you like that, you mother-loving commie!
anger|Just go already.
anger|Do you mind?
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
disgust|Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
sadness|Oh, nothing really. Just trying to psych myself up to try my initiation. Again. Raaaar!
neutral|A lot of our high-end weaponry comes from Pre-War military schematics. If our competition got a hold of them, it'd be bad for business.
neutral|Hellloooo, sparky.
neutral|Still. I often wonder the same thing.
neutral|Sure.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
disgust|I'm sure our victory was purely thanks to your brilliant leadership, boss.
anger|Problem is, Ranger Milo doesn't want to play. If we take out the hostages, they've got squat for leverage.
anger|You have no idea who you're messing with!
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
surprise|Hey hey hey, what the hell...?
joy|You're a model citizen, thank you.
joy|Then I can't help you. Sorry.
anger|Grrrraah!
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
fear|I don't want to get shot!
neutral|That news was brought to you by the Tops Casino. You'll dig us, baby! We're the Tops!
neutral|Let McCarran know they should expect the first shipment in a week or so.
neutral|A package courier found shot in the head near Goodsprings has reportedly regained consciousness and made a full recovery.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|You won't get a fucking cap from me, and you're lucky I don't blow your goddamn head off.
neutral|One of these days we'll be free.
joy|NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
neutral|A Legion slaver party was wiped out in a failed raid of the Bitter Springs refugee camp, with two armed civilians inflicting heavy Legion casualties.
fear|You're not going to cause any problems, right?
neutral|That looks like all of them.
neutral|I don't care if you have to kill every Legionary at the Fort. Get the job done.
anger|Look out!
joy|Whoa! Are you like... some kind of crazy person?
fear|Oh. You heard that, huh? Okay, so yeah, I was writing poetry. I know, I know, it's not a very Great Khan-like thing to do.
anger|What, you think I can just waltz in there and take her away? She's their doll now, okay?
surprise|They were a backward bunch. But the real problem was, they didn't know how to fight.
surprise|Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
fear|Hey, hey! Look who it is. My best buddy.
neutral|But in a shocking turn of events, an army of Securitrons has seized control of the Dam, preventing both sides from claiming it.
anger|Let's see you handle this!
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|My recommendation, get the fuck out of town while you can. It'll leave you hanging in the wind or, worse, add your body to a concrete wall, okay?
anger|He said we needed to be punished for what we did, not all of us, but some of us. And then he gives everyone a fucking lottery ticket...
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
surprise|I understand you've been invited to meet with Caesar. You should be aware of the honor you've been granted.
surprise|Were you trying to hide from me?
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
joy|I figured it might take him a while to understand his accounting error and cool down a little.
anger|I really don't have the time to chatter right now.
anger|They appear to be running a slave-trading operation and it also seems to be one of the primary crossing points for Legion raiding parties.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
surprise|Aha!
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
neutral|My name's Frank Weathers. I'm a farmer, got a few hundred acres near Junktown. Well, I was a farmer. I guess I'm not much of anything now.
joy|What can I help you with?
neutral|Do they? That's a relief. I wasn't so sure, myself. Protecting people from technology seems like a big job for such a small group.
neutral|I care because he is a known quantity - not the man so much as the political context he inhabits.
joy|No, no that's not necessary. I'm fine. Just a little stressed out, that's all.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
joy|Nice work dealing with Caesar. That'll make holding the Mojave a lot easier.
fear|This place is hell. I've seen my all my friends butchered by the Legion in front of my very eyes. I can still hear their screams at night.
anger|I've got a lot to do. Make it quick.
neutral|There's a security room near the base of the stairs... perhaps you can deactivate them yourself.
anger|Hear something, doesn't sound like a friend of yours.
anger|Knock it off!
neutral|That would be how he learned of the Platinum Chip in the first place... not to mention where to intercept you, on your way in.
anger|That's bullshit, and it's nothing to bother the King with. More like they sent someone to spy on us and he wasn't tough enough to last in Freeside.
anger|I heard from Dr. Richards and I wouldn't call what you did helping. We need all the men we can get on the frontline.
joy|Thanks.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
anger|You too? Think I'm just a little girl? I'll show you!
neutral|You go down there and use the Chip to do whatever Mr. House woulda wanted you to do. And when you get back to the Strip, you find Yes Man.
surprise|Whoa!
neutral|Whoa, hey. All right, man. It's cool. Who said anything about being your master?
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
neutral|Great, I'll start heading back to California now. I'm not about to let myself get killed by future NCR incompetence.
neutral|Man, I don't even know. It's crazy.
neutral|Vale.
joy|I bet NCR troops can't wait to clean the sewers.
neutral|The contracts keep employees around for a specific duration of time, after which they get paid - after their upkeep expenses are deducted, of course.
surprise|Are you shitting me? You didn't even know what the plan was? Yeah, as a last request I guess we can give you that courtesy.
neutral|I don't think so. You already have a dog right there.
fear|I hope my dad doesn't find out how much money those hookers cost me.
disgust|Better not try that again.
neutral|There won't be a next time. I hope.
neutral|If they're fortunate enough to become slaves, a new name will be given to them - one they can be proud of.
disgust|Well, that's it then.
neutral|Talk to Jack, he'd be happy to sell you some top-quality chems. He'll even give you a discount.
neutral|No suspects have been identified, but seniors are advised to be on the lookout for the  so-called Denture Killer.
sadness|Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
surprise|I've never seen a robot like that before.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
neutral|Pretty accurate, and so were we.
neutral|Ten percent of the co-op's profits.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
sadness|Today... tomorrow... it doesn't matter, we're all going to die in this war.
joy|Heh. People don't exactly line up to find out what's in my head. Can't remember the last time someone suggested I knew something worth knowing.
surprise|
fear|The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
surprise|You've taken down Cazadores! Didn't think I'd ever see that.
neutral|Talk to Jack, he'd be happy to sell you some top-quality chems. He'll even give you a discount.
anger|Running will only make the pain last longer!
disgust|Just what we need around here, a loose cannon causing more trouble.
joy|Going to place me a good bet at The Thorn.
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
neutral|If we must.
neutral|Followers: Vilified.
joy|From the top! Where else, uh? I am Carlitos - my fingers work the magic and my hands deal the luck!
fear|Word is they're sending some of us home since we're not making the quota.
neutral|So, what do you say? You going to take care of those geckos?
anger|I don't get you. Sometimes you help the Followers, and other times you work against us.
fear|Word is they're sending some of us home since we're not making the quota.
neutral|Good luck - you'll need it.
joy|It's not much, but I want you to have this. Thanks for your help.
surprise|Head voices know smelly ghoul. He old and good with guns.
neutral|Sure.
neutral|All the latest news, coming your way right now.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
anger|Fine then.
neutral|Take it on home.
surprise|Thesis and antithesis. The Colorado River is my Rubicon. The NCR council will be eradicated, but the new synthesis will change the Legion as well...
joy|Let's move out!
surprise|Not too bad, at least you didn't kill anyone.
joy|I guess old guys are tougher than we look, huh?
disgust|You mean like the one I'm already using, boss?
neutral|VStoryEventBoomers set to 2.
anger|You tramp! Like I needed another social disease anyhow!
joy|Nellis, glittering like shrapnel in the desert sun. Nellis, bursting with missiles, warheads, and bombs. Nellis had waited. Just for us.
neutral|I don't like the sound of this. Hope that collar isn't what I think it is. What did you do, Elijah?
neutral|Seems I'm fortunate to get that much for them, given the circumstances!
anger|That's not a good idea.
joy|Oh! Well I'm Alice and that handsome stranger yonder is my husband Dusty. Going on fifty years, now.
joy|If you can scout out the camp, bring back any intel on troop movement or plans for future raids. The rangers could put that information to good use.
surprise|Work of the chupacabra, the livestock vampire, says No-bark, but they don't pay no mind. Too many holes, they say, and there's bullets in them.
fear|What!? No, please! Here, take the caps but please don't hurt me!
anger|We should've never come here.
joy|Nice try. Let's play another game.
neutral|That actually manages to surprise me, stranger. I'm starting to believe that there's something special about you.
fear|Fight!
joy|You can't hide from me.
anger|You're lucky you haven't been shot walking in here after you killed the president.
neutral|Take it on home.
sadness|We're near a Legion slave camp now. I've... been here before.
joy|New Vegas, paradise, my ass.
anger|No!
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
sadness|Okay, I guess we're doing this.
disgust|But here everything is huge and threatening - so empty that I think one of these days I'll just... snap.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
surprise|Trouble!
joy|Well, that's a hell of a lot better than going back to prison.
neutral|He's a stubborn old man, but when it comes down to it, he's got our best interests at heart.
anger|Who's got a target?
anger|What makes you think I give a damn about you?
surprise|You're wasting no time in making a name for yourself around here, huh?
fear|Son of a bitch!
neutral|Witness descriptions are remarkably similar to accounts of the Goodsprings courier who, as we reported, recently survived a gunshot to the head.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
anger|Pull that trigger, you'll wish you hadn't.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
surprise|We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
neutral|He killed fifteen before they brought him down. He didn't die, obviously.
fear|We're out of food, we're out of men, and we're out of time. The Legion is right outside waiting to kill us all.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
surprise|Hey!
disgust|Suit yourself.
neutral|There's a pawn shop in Outer Vegas we could check. And I've heard of a gift shop in the Strip that deals in Pre-War antiques.
joy|I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
anger|Got time to save us too, or are you running errands for your NCR masters?
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
anger|Cover your eyes, pumpkin, or you'll go blind!
anger|We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
anger|The ground in Forlorn Hope was soaked red, from the blood of our own people!
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
surprise|Whoa there, buddy. What you're suggesting is downright archaic.
fear|I can't talk to you. It's not allowed.
joy|Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
surprise|Hey!
anger|Of course it's dangerous! Damn Legion raiding parties have been giving us hell ever since they took over Nelson.
sadness|I doubt it. Poindexter might have an idea for some kind of last-minute scheme. You should talk to him.
anger|I'm not scared of you!
anger|You'd better get out of here.
neutral|So long, stranger.
joy|I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
joy|Good to see you.
joy|It was a matter of time before someone got to Mr. House.
joy|Around you are the incredible Eyebot, the fearsome Sentry Bot, and the always-helpful Mr. Handy. That helpfulness runs through our whole line!
fear|My squad was ambushed by a Legion party lead by that bastard Alexus.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
neutral|The chief scientist at the plant vowed to fix the problem, blaming it on an atmosphere of, quote, severe underappreciation.
anger|Fucking geckos.
joy|Locals got these little gardens that do real well. Gosh darn well, truth be told. Ettienne got some help from that Anderson kid, I think.
anger|I should kill you myself for what you did to Kimball, and fuck the law!
neutral|You can find it in the basement of the burned-out old building at the mouth of the canyon.
surprise|I hear Mr. House cashed out. Ain't much to miss.
surprise|House? More like House light. I heard he got himself unplugged.
anger|Got 'em, boss!
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
joy|How'd you know I had a sweet tooth, boss?
neutral|Ask and you might get an answer.
anger|The ground in Forlorn Hope was soaked red, from the blood of our own people!
anger|You'd better get out of here.
neutral|Well, pain-killers are easy to come by, but it isn't easy finding iodine, allergy meds, and a few of these other items. Why do you ask?
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
neutral|Laser cannons mounted on the roof of the Lucky 38 destroyed another 9 warheads. The rest got through, though none hit the city itself.
fear|He should have been back two days ago, but there's been no sign of him.
neutral|Do you really think your ragtag band of slavers has more manpower than the armed forces of the NCR?
anger|What the hell?!
fear|Stop it! Help!
neutral|Like what?
joy|That would help me, a lot!
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
anger|We'll get 'em.
sadness|Red Lucy was a fine warrior, and a beautiful woman.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
anger|Fuck that Fiend bastard. Wish I would've seen him die.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
sadness|No... Joana! It can't be! She didn't deserve this, she didn't, you hear?
anger|You dirty coward!
disgust|Just take this status report back to Major Polatli. That's all I need from you.
neutral|Hmm, perhaps I was wrong about your skills. You've killed more NCR than most recruits.
joy|I hope everyone on the surface is like you.
sadness|That's why you're the boss. You always make the right decisions. I'll just head home. Home to my lonely, abandoned shack in the middle of nowhere.
joy|Consider it "on the house," honey.
surprise|I didn't know the Brotherhood had any people out here.
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
anger|Tell my mama I've done my best.
anger|Tangle with the Gun Runners and it's the last thing you'll do.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
anger|You're not exactly making friends around here, are you?
surprise|Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
neutral|Doesn't have that kind of importance anymore, though. They pulled most of the troops out of there after we took the Hoover Dam.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
anger|No!
joy|Thanks.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
neutral|Well, when two people really love each other... you really don't know this stuff yet?
anger|Had enough?
surprise|I've never seen a robot like that before.
anger|I don't have time to give my life story to everyone that passes through. Is there something I can actually help you with?
sadness|If someone can blow up the Monorail, I guess we're not safe even in the Strip.
anger|Flank 'em!
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
neutral|They weren't here for me to ask, but I doubt they were here for electricity.
fear|Hope you're looking, boss, because I don't see so good.
anger|That's stealing!
neutral|Yes, and herded them to the center of town. I told them their sins, the foremost being disloyalty.
neutral|I'll be shooting Stacey till you get back. Just saying goodbye to it, you know?
neutral|That looks like all of them.
neutral|Fifty caps, just like we agreed.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
sadness|Dammit! You're going to leave me hanging, uh? Don't know how else I can get her back.
surprise|Baby, you have got to be joking!
neutral|Wish he'd give it up, so the NCR could focus on securing the border.
joy|They do say that! I guess you can be my friend.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
surprise|I can spare a few moments, make it quick.
sadness|I heard President Kimball was assassinated during his visit to Hoover Dam. Doesn't surprise me, we're all going to end up dead soon anyway.
joy|I hear James Garret drove 5,000 head of Brahmin to New Reno. No bodies, just the heads.
joy|Thanks again for helping with Mr. House's data network. Come see me at the Old Mormon Fort if you get a chance.
neutral|Awww... I liked having it on.
surprise|I... I didn't think it showed. I guess that it's worse than I thought.
surprise|Holy shit!
neutral|By "goodbye," I assume you mean to say that you can't talk right now because you need to go get the Platinum Chip off Benny's body.
neutral|VStoryEventAssaultTheTops set to 1.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
neutral|Suit yourself. What else do you want to know?
neutral|All right, girls, show's over.
anger|Andy's not gonna be happy. Where the hell's that crazy bitch?
disgust|Then may you die in his service. I have nothing to say to you.
fear|The Legion may be gone from Nelson, but there's still a whole fucking army of them out there.
joy|Welcome to REPCONN Headquarters, Rocketeer! Come all this way to see our little facility, have you?
neutral|However, they would still have to pass the initiation rite to truly join our ranks.
neutral|Quarry Junction is overrun with Deathclaws, but you may stand a better chance at a nest near the Repconn Test Site.
surprise|All right, you drive a hard bargain, baby. Tell you what, I'll bump him up to 3,000. That's fair. Here's the difference for your cut.
anger|Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
disgust|Try robbing me, will you?
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
anger|They killed her!
anger|Damn!
surprise|Aha!
neutral|Yeah. I'm not worried. They can handle themselves. But somebody has to get the groceries, know what I mean?
neutral|First base is whatever Mr. House would have you do. Follow orders, rig the game to his specifications.
surprise|They looked at me like I was some kind of a sorcerer. So I taught them how to make explosives, and started drilling them on small unit tactics.
surprise|I've been hearing some rumors from the Embassy that Mr. House has gone quiet all of a sudden. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
surprise|Found you!
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
anger|But this isn't gonna end well.
surprise|All the dough!? Cachino once said this traitor flipped with thousands off the record. But, why wasn't I informed?
anger|Sorry, I don't believe you.
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
anger|Just keep on walking.
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
anger|Look out!
anger|That's mine, human!
surprise|Grenade!
surprise|Head voices say smart man also metal man. Don't like metal men!
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
surprise|Glad that fucker House is gone.
anger|No!
neutral|VStoryEventBennySeen set to 1.
disgust|I must question your logic in coming here, in light of your prior actions.
neutral|The computer to activate it is just ahead, but you may need to go outside to activate the manual override. That system hasn't been used in a while.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
neutral|Our forces are better equipped to take objectives than hold them. I do not wish to defend this place if another option exists.
disgust|They're kind of heavy for that, but whatever you say....
anger|It's about time you showed up.
neutral|Tops Hotel owner Benny has been killed by an unidentified assailant. His former right-hand man, Swank, consoled mourners.
anger|No!
joy|Thanks to your help, I think Bitter Springs has a real shot at surviving. I can't offer you much of a reward, but know that the NCR is very grateful.
joy|I should've met you before, stranger. Thank you.
anger|They killed her!
neutral|Skirmishes, mostly. The Legion raiding parties usually fall back when they know it's us they're up against.
anger|What have you done?
neutral|Uh... I was just... uh... getting some fresh air and stretching my legs. It's getting pretty late though, I should get going. Goodnight.
neutral|Th-thank you! I don't know that we'll ever be able to repay you, but we'll do our best one day once I've found a place to settle.
anger|What the hell?!
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
anger|They killed him!
neutral|Caesar's Legion: Vilified.
neutral|I guess I'll just keep waiting. Sorry to bother you.
fear|Leave me alone!
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
neutral|Don't leave a trail.
anger|They killed him!
surprise|What the hell?Is that a half-robot dog?
joy|Another satisfied customer.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
anger|I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
neutral|All who are not Legion are "Dissolute." They live in squalor, unrestrained by morality, lacking moderation, temper, and self-control.
sadness|Between radiation poisoning and attacks by the Legion they all died out.
anger|You and I have got nothing to talk about.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
neutral|Good luck.
surprise|So far working with the NCR hasn't been too bad. If anything, things seem to be getting better.
anger|Come on!
anger|As the bar!
neutral|A Legion outpost. What's it look like?
neutral|You speak the truth, stranger, and The Thorn lives by the justice that honor and strength dispense. Here's a more fitting sum.
fear|Please - I'll be in trouble if the Legionaries see you speaking to me.
joy|He's usually down around the proving ground if you want to say yo.
anger|The Burned Man would leave their mightiest shitting themselves in terror! I would... Uhhh, that is....
joy|It's amazing that Kimball managed to survive.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
neutral|Yeah.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
fear|Okay, carry on. And, we've never been here, you understand? Boss doesn't need to know about this.
neutral|The Strip: Vilified.
neutral|Confirmed, we'll fall back. Good luck.
joy|"Dishonorable", that's a good one. Okay then, you can just turn around and head back toward Novac or wherever it is you came from.
disgust|I'm sure Mr. Torini already took care of your fee. Maybe you ought to talk to him. Much obliged for the opportunity, friend. See you around.
neutral|You wear the Mark of Caesar?! You must be who Cursor Lucullus is waiting for.
fear|I give up!
anger|What the hell?!
disgust|How do they expect us to fight the Legion with only the crappy equipment and gear they gave us?
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
surprise|Hey!
anger|No!
surprise|Aha!
anger|You think you scare me? Come on! Do it!
neutral|You're right. I'm sorry. That imbecile in the next room has me on edge. I used to be more fun.
anger|I don't know if that's such a great idea.
joy|House dead, Strip can belong to anyone who wants it. Fiends to rule.
surprise|Hey!
joy|Mr. House finally wised up and said he'd join the NCR in a year or something like that. Good news all around.
anger|Dammit, someone offed Motor-Runner! That guy was one of our biggest clients.
neutral|The ugly bastard knocked me down and started dragging me down into these caves. I managed to get my knife out and get a good throw into it's back.
disgust|Come back when you actually have the money, you damn junkie.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
joy|That is one battered Eyebot. It's a miracle it's still functioning.
surprise|If you had asked me a month ago, I'd have said we'd never willingly work with the NCR. But look at us now.
anger|But when I talk to her, she laughs and mocks and has her brothers beat me.
neutral|You know I think all news, whether it's good or bad, brings us closer together. Don't you?
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
anger|We don't have much time.
surprise|I've never a dog like that. Who thinks up these things?
neutral|With our recent achievements, they finally feel secure enough to stage the damn thing. But while it's being planned, I have one last mission for you.
neutral|Said we'd been selected. Vegas needed us to defend it. In exchange, we'd get cushy digs, full stomachs, medical treatment.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
joy|I hope you're finding everything to your liking.
surprise|What in the goddamn...?
neutral|I happen to disagree. 700 caps, and that's my one and only offer.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
neutral|Uh oooooh, it's the *law,* girls!
fear|I had no idea there was such a thing as a friendly Nightkin. Look at that thing.
neutral|Evidence suggests that Mr. House is planning to make some kind of move when the battle breaks out, and I'm guessing he won't be coming to our rescue.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|Once, he was the greatest warrior of the Hidebarks, a tribe of the Arizona. Maniacal in battle. Sometimes he'd ambush Legion patrols by himself.
joy|Then I can't help you. Sorry.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
fear|The Khans are all gone, wonder if they left behind their shit for making our goods.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
anger|That's not a good idea.
joy|Get some sleep. You got a big day ahead of you.
joy|Good riddance, Caesar! We can finally enjoy some R&R without worrying about a Legion attack at McCarran.
neutral|As much as their cowardice will allow. The Profligates avoid open battle, but on good days we find one of their patrols.
surprise|Aha!
anger|We get in position and next thing we know, we're surrounded by those fucking Legion freaks.
neutral|Reports out of Arizona quote Caesar as saying he's "never felt better" after undergoing emergency brain surgery.
joy|There's nothing else like The Thorn!
anger|Faster, people, faster! More lead in the air!
neutral|Wait, Lily's not in position yet. Talk to me again once she's settled in.
anger|You want to be getting that gun out of my face right now.
neutral|Ha! Well that's... imaginative. But it's not really for me.
sadness|Yeah, I know.
anger|Grrrraah!
fear|Anything moves, it's going to get it.
neutral|NCR's First Recon Battalion was waiting for them on Coyote Tail Ridge. No Khan left alive, that was the order. My family....
surprise|Isn't that Cass? I heard she'd gotten out of the caravan business.
fear|After what happened to Mr. House, nobody knows for sure what's in play for the Strip.
neutral|I think we're too small and poor for anyone to bother with, really. I keep a weapon near my bunk, though - same as everybody here.
neutral|These headlines were brought to you by Vault 21. Vault 21. Everything's better when you experience it in a vault.
anger|Set it up right, and the families will roll with your caper. You might have to do some convincing.
joy|Those Legion beasts needed to be put down, like the vermin they are!
anger|Where's my son? What'd you do with my boy?
surprise|Someone with medical experience, I take it? It's not the best, but it does the job.
anger|Light 'em up!
surprise|Hey!
anger|That's not a good idea.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
joy|You been to the Strip? Last time I had R&R, I left with 300 caps more than I went in. Who says the House always wins?
anger|Why am I even scared of Cachino and all those fuckers? Joana and I are dead anyway if we don't get the hell out of here.
anger|Why are you even talking to me?
neutral|One anonymous official told us a serious mechanical failure would be a disaster because of the age of the train and scarcity of replacement parts.
neutral|You aren't exactly good for business, so you'll have to live with my prices.
joy|Whoa! Are you like... some kind of crazy person?
anger|Okay. Well, I guess I can let it go this time.
neutral|I would think you'd know better than I. But perhaps they kept their operation here a secret, even from members of their own order.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
fear|Please no!
disgust|Murderer!
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
neutral|Killing our Bighorners, shooting at the lodge, that sort of thing. It's getting hard to keep people from retaliating.
fear|Primm is going to be much tougher to push around with that new sheriff down there.
disgust|You've got a funny definition of "well," you know that? Whatever. Thanks for... whatever that was.
anger|Damn!
joy|My programming requires that I keep trying to kill you.
neutral|Permanent damage to her mind is a certainty. Even the cure won't help her.
anger|You dirty coward!
sadness|I'm here because I have nowhere else to go.
neutral|Ugly-looking thing, but the guys like having it around. Good for morale and all that.
joy|I hope the Fiends stop their raids now that their boss is gone
neutral|VStoryEventKimballAssassination set to 3.
neutral|You think? Well good, then. That puts me a little more at ease.
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
sadness|Let me know when you do find something out.
joy|Running away is probably your only hope.
joy|Thank you! I really can't thank you enough for this. Please, get me all the pictures. I will compensate you accordingly.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
neutral|Our opponents follow a strict chain of command, which is both a strength and weakness. I intend to use you to strike at that weakness.
neutral|Yeah. It's not for poker.
joy|Okay - you try that and let me know, okay? How she looks, what she's wearing, she's safe, anything - I'll pay you, you hear?
anger|They killed him!
joy|I think that should just about cover us. I really don't know how to thank you, bringing me these supplies saved a lot of people.
surprise|If you had asked me a month ago, I'd have said we'd never willingly work with the NCR. But look at us now.
neutral|Your assignment is unchanged - destroy the Brotherhood of Steel. Please get it right this time.
neutral|On how many can you take, stranger?
fear|Need to regroup!
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
fear|There's some weird chatter on the radio saying something wiped out Nelson and Forlorn Hope. That's pretty scary.
anger|What was that for?
neutral|Wait... what are you going to do?
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
sadness|Not like I even voted for him, but losing the President's a hell of a morale killer.
surprise|Hoping to steal our rockets so they can fly up and paint the moon pink and draw a Lenin face on it.
fear|No, come on, don't slaughter me like I'm some kind of animal!
sadness|My empty scream does not echo, even though we're in a canyon.
anger|I never trusted those Omerta punks, even if I like their girls.
neutral|Move up to the next position.
anger|I've done everything Caesar ever asked of me, and this is how I am repaid? With assassination?
neutral|When the battle begins, the NCR will find our teeth at their throats in a dozen places. There will be no attrition, no falling back, only carnage.
fear|I really don't have anything you'd want.
neutral|Interesting. Try thinking aggressive thoughts now. Think about smashing a Radscorpion.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
sadness|Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
surprise|Hello! It was you, smashed up the Omertas? You did that? Shit.
neutral|Boomers: Shunned.
surprise|The bots have enough firepower to arm a full platoon.
joy|Psycho! The big red one! I used to run with the Fiends, I still got the hookups. Smuggle some in and you'll see an improvement.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
anger|What do you need?
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
anger|What in blazes? That's my son you're talking about! He ain't dead. I'm looking for him.
joy|I can comp you the Presidential - best suite in the house. After what you been through, you deserve a taste of the VIP lifestyle.
disgust|If I have to put up with another night of Private Stone's whining, I swear I'm going to strangle him.
neutral|Color me unconvinced. The safe bet is to cash you out.
sadness|No, I'm afraid we don't. Do you have a friend you wanted to bring in?
joy|I hope the Fiends stop their raids now that their boss is gone
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
joy|You're quite welcome. If you meet anyone who needs food or water in the area, please tell them about this place.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
anger|We'll keep that in mind. Now, if you're not going to buy something, get out.
neutral|Yeah? Let's see it.
disgust|Better not try that again.
anger|Fuck you, asshole! You're gonna regret it!
joy|Hey, you there! I have a message for you.
joy|That comedian you mean? Yeah, he was a hell of a haggler. Cost me a pretty cap - hope he's worth it. Here's your 5%.
anger|Damn!
surprise|Can you imagine how much electricity it takes to keep this Vault running?
surprise|The tables turned for Mr. House. What next, huh?
fear|I'm sorry boss... Sometimes I just can't control myself. I dunno what's wrong with me. I swear, I can turn this around. Just gimme another chance.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
disgust|Papa Khan has been talking to Caesar's emissary for weeks now - they're always going on about crushing the NCR.
surprise|Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
surprise|Put that down!
anger|Oh, you think I won't do it? I'll show you!
neutral|Travelers are advised not to make friendly chit-chat with them.
neutral|Keep your heads down and move up to the next location.
neutral|Food, water, living quarters, medicine, and clothes - just the basic stuff. It all comes out of the Company's coffers.
surprise|My god!
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
anger|All right, let's try this again.
surprise|Holy shit!
anger|I saw you take that!
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
surprise|I can't believe the King is dead. What's going to happen to us now?
anger|We will find you!
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
fear|Need to regroup!
anger|Didn't your mama ever tell you not to hit old ladies?
neutral|BoS: Shunned.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
sadness|Excellent. I'll let him know you're coming. Good luck out there.
neutral|Troubling news from Primm as merchants report a large presence of armed, unsavory figures patrolling the town. Residents are nowhere to be found.
disgust|Suit yourself.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
neutral|Other than bottles, you'll just have to scavenge. You can find caps in the unlikeliest of places, and blue-star caps are no exception.
neutral|For 4,000 caps, I can install a Logic Co-Processor.
sadness|Chair... empty? Head voices say so.
anger|You shouldn't have crossed the Powder Gangers! Now you're going to pay!
neutral|When the NCR first came here, it was under Brotherhood control. They usually steer clear of one another, but something here changed their minds.
anger|What was that for?
neutral|Software glitches set off a cascade of system crashes. I had to take the Lucky 38's reactor offline, lest it melt down.
neutral|Good. Tell Etienne about our deal and I'll turn myself in.
neutral|Unconfirmed reports say NCR's General Lee Oliver may have uprooted from his post at Camp McCarran in order to be present at Hoover Dam.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
disgust|That's a good start. Now just keep running and we'll call it even.
neutral|But he's still alive? I'll have to remember to send someone to follow up on that later. Anyway, at least he's out of the picture for the time being.
anger|You think you can take it? All right, bastard! I'll give you what you deserve!
sadness|I'm sorry that you had to act that way.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
anger|You're all hypocrites! How can you claim to be connoisseurs yet deny yourselves the greatest of all meats?
fear|You'd do that? Thanks! I mean, I'd go myself, but what if they said no? The Khans wouldn't take me back, and then I'd have nobody.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|I don't want to risk running into a pack of those freaks alone, though. Could you escort me out of here?
anger|The Major sent you because we don't have any men to spare. So why don't you make yourself useful and find those troops and supplies for me.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|If the NCR thinks White was killed by, say, members from the Scorpions gang, it may be enough for them to close the case.
surprise|If you believe my mother, since she first laid eyes on me. First thing she said was "Boy! That's a funny-looking kid!"
anger|The Legion forces have been reinforced and are looking pretty strong. It's going to be a tough fight.
surprise|What the-?
sadness|I wish we were back at our Vault.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|There's people out there so mad with the idea of treasure that they'll attack strangers just on the suspicion that they have some of those caps.
sadness|It's a distress call. This camp is in bad shape, and if we don't get relief soon, I don't know what will happen.
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
joy|I've heard of your fights at The Thorn. People down here don't stop talking about you.
disgust|We're also strongly in favor of proper education. I've come across more than a few "doctors" whose techniques came out of the back of a magazine.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
disgust|For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
neutral|Finally.
fear|Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
surprise|Found you!
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
surprise|There's no point in trying to hide from me, you know. I've been programmed to be quite relentless.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
surprise|No! These are lies! I never kidnapped anyone. And even if I did, there's no harm done. He's alive, after all.
neutral|Thank you, my brave hunter.
surprise|You shouldn't be so naughty, pumpkin!
joy|Nice try. Let's play another game.
neutral|Still, Caesar is a capable strategist. I'd be surprised if he hasn't found some way to infiltrate the dam, or the NCR's rear areas.
neutral|A sub-optimal performance, admittedly. If only the Platinum Chip had arrived a day sooner...
joy|With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
surprise|Really, you're one of a kind.
neutral|You're right. I've been a mean son of a bitch the past couple years.
neutral|Accident or not, you're to blame!
surprise|Hey!
neutral|Glad you could join us. Most of my men are already on duty and the crowd has already started gathering outside.
disgust|Yes, please do.
anger|They killed her!
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
disgust|You sick bastard, I could have shot you! You must be the backup I've been calling for.
joy|Considering the way Caesar treats women, that should really put some doubts into his troops' minds. Wait til the rangers hear about this!
anger|Please, if you know the truth, tell me. Those guys were friends of mine.
anger|No!
surprise|Both Gundersons, gone? I'll be damned, you are one of a kind!
surprise|Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
anger|Huh. Must be some frontal lobe damage.
neutral|I've been able to get some basic information on the schedule for Kimball's visit as well as getting some rough security details.
joy|You're wise to serve the Legion by choice.
fear|You killed him! What have we done to you?
neutral|Goddammit, I'm actually gonna to let you live. What's come over me?
anger|Then stop wasting my time and get on it!
neutral|All right, then. Be patient since this will take awhile.
disgust|So now it's come to open assassination attempts against the President? Hard to believe.
sadness|You forgive me? After what I done? Baby, are you trying to make me cry?
disgust|If I have to put up with another night of Private Stone's whining, I swear I'm going to strangle him.
neutral|VStoryEventCampGolf set to 1.
neutral|Um... it's sweet of you to offer, but no thanks.
joy|I like that you're here, doesn't that make you happy?
neutral|Look at the Followers of the Apocalypse. They use their expertise to improve people's lives. They train them to be self-sufficient.
joy|I heard about how you saved the President's life. It's a good thing you were there. Things could have turned out really ugly.
joy|The beasts don't look so tough behind bars, huh?
anger|He's trying to pull a fast one on the big man? Crazy bastard. You got any more?
neutral|You are a match to my elite, but don't congratulate yourself so profusely just yet. Still, your valor deserves recognition and I shall honor it.
anger|What was that for?
anger|Cut it out, will you?
joy|my foot in the box canyon.
joy|Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
neutral|That's too bad. Ol' Festus was looking forward to a good tussle.
joy|My lucky day, running into our President's savior!
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
neutral|You are paying for it. What'll bleed today in The Thorn, stranger?
neutral|Why would you say something like that? That's just mean.
joy|That sounds good, hon. I hope to see you soon.
anger|Flank 'em!
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
joy|You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
anger|What have you done?
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
fear|He didn't say, but it sounded very important.
surprise|Holy shit!
anger|In that case, this is for them.
surprise|Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
disgust|For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
surprise|Found you!
fear|Boss, you really think that's a good idea?
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
fear|So long as the Khans keep making it, I keep getting high.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
anger|What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
anger|
neutral|I'm not sure what you mean. I think you have me confused with someone else.
joy|Until next time.
neutral|Nothing as severe. Charlie seems to be getting a lot of extra medical supplies for some reason, while Bravo hasn't requested a resupply in awhile.
neutral|Bring me a dozen Radscorpion eggs. I'll see to it that you're rewarded fairly.
anger|You were supposed to negotiate for the safety of my troopers, damn it.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
neutral|Come on, big man, roll up in here!
joy|Then I can't help you. Sorry.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
anger|They killed her!
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
fear|Just, don't do anything crazy.
disgust|Kimball dead, maybe the NCR will learn to stay the fuck out of other people's business.
anger|All right. I'll let it go - this time.
neutral|All right, tell the boy to report here, he can leave on the next caravan.
neutral|Get lost!
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
surprise|Aha!
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
joy|You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
surprise|I'll hand it to that piece of shit, he was determined. He used some kind of Old-World stealth device to get across the river in a Legion boat.
joy|Good to see a friend of our government.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
surprise|Holy shit!
anger|Grenade!
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
neutral|That's all for now. This is Mr. New Vegas saying, I'm just no good without you.
disgust|Fuck, where are we gonna get our shit from now that the Khans are all buddy buddy with the NCR.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
joy|How do I put this basically enough? It's a philosophical theory, the kind you might encounter if you took time to read some books.
neutral|Hmm... I don't know. Doesn't that... mess you up?
surprise|Someone got Mr. House. The Strip's going to change, I'd bet on it.
anger|Fuck that Fiend bastard. Wish I would've seen him die.
anger|That's not a good idea.
joy|Did you see me take out that NCR trooper? Right through his eye!
fear|You're not going to do anything crazy, are you? It's just, you know... the paperwork....
anger|I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
surprise|What was that?
joy|Great fighting today.
neutral|VStoryEventCaesarKilled to 1.
joy|Feeling thirsty?
anger|What the hell do you want, you vicious bitch?
neutral|Explosives. Bombs. Big, big fucking bombs. You gonna help us or not?
anger|After Ma died, I guess I wanted to find my Pa and get some answers from him. Been out here looking ever since, but he ain't an easy man to find.
neutral|Just wherever the wind takes you, huh? I like that. Keeps things interesting.
sadness|Or maybe she's just a dupe. Why do you even care? She's happy making her own way in the world.
surprise|I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
disgust|You'll probably have an easier time of things if you can find a way to get him out of the picture.
sadness|That's too bad. These men really needed those supplies.
surprise|Aha!
sadness|I came east to strike it rich, and now I'm broker than ever. What do I tell my family back home?
anger|Prize for second place was I got to live, but they beat my fucking legs with hammers. I'm fucking crippled, get it?
fear|Still, with the Legion just across the river, we have to be ready.
fear|Just, don't do anything crazy.
neutral|Whatever you say, stranger. Go snoop somewhere else and get the fuck out of my house, right now!
anger|I should make you pay for your crimes!
surprise|Holy shit!
anger|No!
joy|Take care, now.
anger|Once I'm done here, I hope they assign me to find the son of a bitch that took down our President.
joy|It's good to see you around the Strip.
neutral|Dismissed.
sadness|If I don't get more water soon, I won't make my quota this season.
fear|It seems like for every Legion soldier we kill, two more take his place. How many of them are there?
anger|All right. I'll let it go - this time.
anger|That's a conversation we might be able to have some day - once you've shown more respect for my country.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|It ain't like we came to Nipton to play it! Me and my crew had it worked out to kidnap some NCR troopers who come to town to get laid.
sadness|After Ma died, I guess I wanted to find my Pa and get some answers from him. Been out here looking ever since, but he ain't an easy man to find.
surprise|So all this time the old man had an entire army on lay-away? Clever player.
anger|Still looking, boss.
neutral|We're lucky to have some Cazadores in the next match.
anger|You dirty coward!
anger|Kid, I think you really better shut up and stop making baseless accusations unless you got some proof. Well?
neutral|Bring me a dozen Giant Mantis' eggs. If you accomplish this, I might gift you with greater tasks in the future.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
surprise|How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
joy|I told my wife she was good-looking for a ghoul. It's just too bad she's not a ghoul.
anger|Grrrraah!
surprise|I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
neutral|Bye.
anger|You kidding me, man? How are things? They're all fucked up, that's how things are!
neutral|Thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
anger|You want to be getting that gun out of my face right now.
joy|Even the strongest creatures need their rest, and their companionship. I've been looking forward to this.
joy|Hello again. Did you need something else?
sadness|There were a few others with me after it happened, including some of my superiors.
anger|Oh, come on, don't make the old guy chase you!
neutral|Good work, stranger. The Thorn will nurture these eggs until their hatchlings are ready to bleed for us.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
neutral|What's your reputation with the Strip?
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
neutral|Radscorpions. The crowd loves those.
joy|Really? You mean I'm finally out of this shithole? That's great! Thank you!
anger|Box me up and ship me home.
sadness|I'm sorry. I've been programmed to protect private property at all costs.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
disgust|Murderer!
neutral|Shit, you're crazy!
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
neutral|It's better than farming or herding Brahmin. As long as they don't send me to the front lines, I'm a happy man.
neutral|Boomers: Accepted.
anger|I saw you take that!
joy|And that my employer is paying me a pretty penny to loot it.
neutral|It was a place of splendor. As magnificent as today's Strip may seem, it's but a shadow of the neon paradise that was Las Vegas.
anger|You better run, you commie-loving bastard!
anger|Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
anger|A battle is about to be fought out there, to come here requesting our men to give up their armor is insane.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
neutral|Fine, whatever. Forget the severance. Just get the Omertas off my back, and you can tell McLafferty she won't see my face again.
neutral|All right.
disgust|Better not try that again.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
anger|On the Strip, everyone's nice to you when you got the caps. The moment you don't? They throw your ass out.
joy|Thanks mister, you're the greatest.
anger|Should have known, Greeks and gifts. That, and next time, shoot the messenger.
joy|After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
anger|Don't make any trouble for us, we won't make any trouble for you.
neutral|Oh, nowhere in particular, really. Just hoping to see more of the world. Looking for a fresh perspective.
anger|If you want to get fucked up, Gomorrah's the place to go. Wish I was there now.
surprise|Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
anger|I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
joy|Mr. House won't trouble our plans for the Strip any longer, huh!?
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
neutral|Residents of Novac were treated to a surprise light show when HELIOS One unexpectedly began firing lasers. No word yet on the damage.
anger|I see your ploy, smoothskin. I won't fall for your trap. You can plainly see that I'm a ghoul myself. You can't turn me against my flock.
anger|Come on!
neutral|They are too rare and valuable to simply give away, nor have you proven yourself a friend.
neutral|It was Hector's idea, if you can believe it. He overheard me talking to Anderson about his idea to divert the water over here.
sadness|Genius is seldom appreciated in its own time.
anger|Fucking geckos.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
joy|Hey! Seems like you've been making lots of friends around here.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
anger|What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
fear|Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
joy|Man, it's my life. I joined up when I was 16 - I don't know how to do anything else.
surprise|Doesn't he? Caesar's representative tells a different tale.
neutral|Ahh, doing this out of the goodness of your heart. You don't see that very often around here. Thank you.
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
surprise|Oh, you're buying? Tell you what, since you've been acting all, well, random lately, how about a discount? Might calm you down.
sadness|We used to send patrols out to acquire supplies, but ever since Bitter Springs there just aren't enough of us left.
neutral|I'll be fine... eventually.
surprise|What in Maxson's name?
neutral|Everything a nomad never gets, in other words. Most of the tribe thought we should say no. I thought it was the best idea ever.
anger|Come on!
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
surprise|You might have a jaw at Tommy Torini up in the Aces. He's always looking for talent scouts.
anger|Had enough?
joy|It's amazing that Kimball managed to survive.
neutral|The things I've seen now. Other groups succeeding where we fail. It's not too late for us.
neutral|Sure. It's a small wasteland. I'm sure we'll run into each other again.
anger|Come on!
anger|Keep an eye on the crowd and keep an eye out for anything suspicious. Other than that, just stay out of the way.
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
joy|We should straighten those thugs at Gomorrah.
surprise|I hear they got their act together out west - like a real old-time country, they tell me.
surprise|What the hell? You're that courier Benny wasted back in Goodsprings. You're supposed to be dead.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
joy|I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
joy|Never had you pegged as the doctor-type. Guess I know who to come to now when I get sick.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
neutral|Sad what happened to him. He was a good kid.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
neutral|Great Khans: Wild Child.
surprise|You're welcome to try - hell, maybe they'll listen to somebody they don't see as an authority figure.
anger|I doubt I can help you. I'm just a kid, you know.
anger|Go on then. Elevators are past the slot machines on your left.
joy|Okay, friend, I hope to see you again, far away from this place.
fear|Look out!
anger|
neutral|You're the one who should be worried. Good luck.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|Then she has to know! I'm ready to help her escape, once and for all.
anger|I've heard of you. Did you figure on coming out here and helping us lowly troopers out?
anger|Still plenty of other problems keeping the 15 shut down, though. Thanks for playing.
surprise|Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
joy|Hi. How are you today?
joy|Without leadership, the Fiends are as good as dead!
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
neutral|Your reaction times are already so fast it's a wonder you can't catch bullets. The Reflex Booster can't make you any faster.
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
neutral|Those caps with the blue star on them, the tale goes, are the key to that treasure. They're called Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars.
anger|They killed him!
neutral|My creatures are expensive to find, expensive to raise, and expensive to maintain.
joy|Dr. Richards told me how you helped him with his missing supplies. It's unfortunate about Private Stone, but at least it's over with now.
surprise|Hey!
neutral|Of course I will, dearie, if it's helpful. Don't you worry what will happen to little old me. I'm tougher than I look!
neutral|NCR: Vilified.
anger|Damn!
anger|Outer Vegas ain't exactly a safe place. Despite our numbers, The Wasteland creeps through every nook and cranny.
neutral|Sure.
joy|The orders for service rifles and ammunition have been pouring in from McCarran so fast we can't keep up. Hell of a fight is coming.
joy|Thanks to your help, we have more than enough men to take those Legion bastards.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
surprise|What on earth is *that* creature?
surprise|If the Legion can equip their men so well, maybe they can take care of me too.
neutral|They hold themselves to be civilized, when in fact they are corrupt and self-interested. The truth will be made clear to them soon enough.
sadness|I understand.
surprise|Aha!
neutral|The Thorn's calling its elite hunters to collect one of its deadliest creatures. Find Night Stalker eggs and your bravery will be greatly rewarded.
neutral|Carry on.
fear|Careful!
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
disgust|Just what I was hoping for. Trundling around looking for something that wants to blow me to flinders.
joy|You been to the Strip? Last time I had R&R, I left with 300 caps more than I went in. Who says the House always wins?
surprise|I do recall him being fascinated by the Khans, he kept going on about parallels to some ancient historical empire or another.
joy|You ready to participate?
anger|When our children, our sick and old, fled through a nearby pass, the NCR gunned them down.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
neutral|If you must, but please keep it brief.
joy|That's great. They're going to give us an advantage in the battle ahead.
surprise|Huh. Well, yeah, okay, these are Benny's brand, and they ain't too common. You got anything else?
neutral|It's just about time to get you some news.
neutral|So, you must be the Courier the reports mentioned. Pass this message on to your commander - Hoover Dam will not fall while I still draw breath.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
joy|What can I do for you?
joy|It can't be a coincidence, baby. You and me were meant to work together.
disgust|Oh, they claimed it was a miscommunication, but tell that to those who saw our families butchered. Tell it to the survivors who were banished here.
joy|Eye lasers. I'll be sure and look out for that next time.
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
joy|Well, that's all she wrote.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
surprise|Aha!
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
disgust|Gathering junk's not the most exciting work, but it's a living.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
neutral|With the Brotherhood that's their obsessive attachment to technology. They'd never go anywhere that didn't have working power.
surprise|That doesn't even make any sense! You're not the heckler Garret hired to spice up the show, are you?
neutral|Hey, welcome to Red Rock Canyon! Since you've done so much for the Great Khans, Papa Khan told me to let you know you can buy weapons at our Armory.
joy|Do that again!
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
neutral|On my way up here there was some chatter about their commander, the Legate I think he's called, set up at some kind of base on the eastern bank.
surprise|God, you're not lying, are you? You really did kill them.
neutral|Was that meant to be a shocking revelation? Of course Caesar wants it destroyed - he's afraid of what the bunker might hold, and rightly so.
joy|I do get to take shots at Molerats once in awhile, so that's always fun.
joy|Mr. House won't trouble our plans for the Strip any longer, huh!?
joy|I'm not surprised Kimball survived. We NCR people are made of hard stuff.
neutral|Let's hear it.
anger|Once I'm done here, I hope they assign me to find the son of a bitch that took down our President.
anger|Fucking Cooke has us trapped here. After we escaped from an NCR prison, he dragged us around the wasteland until we ended up in this shit hole.
neutral|Tell the truth... I think this is exactly what I've been waiting for.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
neutral|Sure.
sadness|There are so many refugees to care for.
anger|I don't think so.
anger|Damn it!
neutral|In other news...
neutral|Electromagnetic weapon from before the Great War. Experimental. It never saw mass production.
disgust|Maybe he did, maybe he didn't, but that don't change the fact that it wasn't right.
joy|I walked all the way from Hub! Thought I'd rest my feet here a day or two, then I head onto the Strip fresh.
joy|Excellent work. I can't tell you how useful that will be.
neutral|Boy, the Mojave Wasteland is just a fascinating place, isn't it? You never know what'll happen next.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
neutral|You're no friend to the Great Khans. You should turn around and leave - and if we see you in the Mojave, well... accidents happen.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
disgust|Okay... sure. Everybody shoot the hell out of the target!
surprise|The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
neutral|Here's your NCR money. Will there be anything else?
anger|You bastard!
anger|What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
neutral|That bad, huh? Guess I'm lucky I got away with my life. I'll make sure and avoid them from now on. Thanks.
neutral|Why do they call it a monorail... it's a train. A *train.*
disgust|Someone dirty and disreputable, I shouldn't wonder.
anger|They killed him!
surprise|The robots here look different than others I've seen.
joy|Well speak of the devil! The head of the pack!
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
joy|They're probably afraid something is going to happen. For good reason.
neutral|They keep rolling over people, they'll regret it. That's how revolutions start.
joy|Like I said, once the Chairmen are running Vegas, you'll get a percentage. Until then I'll pay you a retainer and bonuses for "special missions."
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
sadness|Terrible thing, what happened to the Hostetlers.
neutral|Maybe because her mother's trying to break her back planting crops that die from rads as soon as they're in the ground.
anger|Bit of a troublemaker, aren't you?
anger|Look out!
fear|Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.
neutral|VStoryEventRacket set to 2.
neutral|Highly resourceful, Benny. He would've made a fine agent, had he stayed loyal. It's fortunate you came along to replace him - and ironic.
neutral|I was told we wouldn't be tested on this.
fear|Yeah... getting butchered like livestock. Something to aspire to.
anger|Now why don't you fuck off and let me sleep, hero? That'd be real exciting, too.
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
fear|Oh, uh, hey - Jack can probably give you a discount, if that'll calm you down.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
anger|Baby, do you not understand the level of game here?
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
neutral|None whatsoever. Everything inside the fence is off-limits, and the guards have strict orders to shoot to kill.
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
fear|I know important people here in the Strip. Powerful people. You, uh, can't get anything out of me.
joy|Good, good. Smart move, human.
surprise|Hey!
joy|Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
anger|I hate it here, fucking sulfur stinks.
neutral|Now... I'm back where I was.
anger|Why are you people treating us like this?
anger|What was that for?
fear|This vault gives me the creeps.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
joy|Hot damn do I love this place.
fear|You killed him! What have we done to you?
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
neutral|VStoryEventBennyFled set to 1.
neutral|That's not the point. Technology won't win our wars. We need numbers. New recruits.
fear|The last patrol I was on got hit by a Legion raiding party and I barely survived. I don't want to go back out there again.
joy|That's a long one, stranger. Let's just say I got tired of killing in The Wasteland and now I've found a better home for my old butt.
anger|When I command you to complete a mission, you will complete it, or you should die in the attempt.
neutral|Didn't leave much choice when you showed up. Like I said, you forced my hand.
neutral|Is that right? What's your angle?
neutral|Thus is Caesar's will. Do not test my patience.
anger|I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
anger|Come on!
neutral|VStoryEventCaesarCured set to 1.
neutral|Got some songs coming up for you right now. At least one is probably about love.
neutral|I'm with you. Being around here isn't the same anymore.
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
joy|NCR should head back to their lands, I'm sure *their* people miss them.
anger|Not seeing things! You're out there!
disgust|Refugee camp? Is that what they're calling it? Good old NCR, they can whitewash anything.
joy|We're in a little desert oasis, name of Novac. This is the Dino Dee-lite Motel, and it's mine.
surprise|What in Maxson's name?
anger|What was that for?
disgust|For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
neutral|Have you even seen a Deathclaw? They're taller than a man and far, far stronger and faster. And, there's a whole pack of them out there.
anger|Nobody screws with the Gun Runners and walks away from it!
neutral|We can go right over here, baby.
fear|All the noise at REPCONN scared the hell out of me.
neutral|Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
neutral|I run the liquor store in Westside. With things this rough, some folks need a lot of booze just to step out the door in the morning.
anger|They killed him!
joy|I won't be missing Mr. House, that's a given. The Strip's better off without him.
anger|All I know is that the whole place is filled with radiation, there are nasty creatures roaming about.
joy|Whatever you think's best.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
surprise|Huh?
neutral|I swear... I'm not drinking... ever... again.
anger|What have you done?
anger|Why am I even scared of Cachino and all those fuckers? Joana and I are dead anyway if we don't get the hell out of here.
neutral|Giant Radscorpions make deadly opponents.
joy|Other than that, nothing to do but take it easy and enjoy good company.
neutral|Playing cards, dice, chess pieces, trinkets like that. Then, next thing I know, he turns around and says he wants six couriers, not seven!
neutral|What else did you want to chat about?
neutral|The Brotherhood's interest in Pre-War technology has always been in weapons. It's likely they were trying to reclaim ARCHIMEDES when the NCR arrived.
joy|I'll give you a quick tour of my home! Oh, yeah, if you like.
neutral|Yeah, every once in a while you can find a cap with a blue star on it. They're pretty rare, so I started collecting them.
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
joy|Hey there, gorgeous. I knew you'd be back soon enough.
joy|I heard you talking to Horowitz, and can't thank you enough for what you've done for us.
joy|NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
anger|Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker if we find out who did it.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
fear|That guy's got cold eyes. Definitely ex-military.
anger|You dirty coward!
joy|Hey, you're smart. Okay, it was like finding diamonds in your vodka and showgirls under your card-table. You want it, Gomorrah has it.
neutral|Like what?
joy|You can't hide from me.
joy|House unplugged like a light. Wonder if he twitched before he bit it.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
neutral|Your eyesight would make a hawk jealous. The Optic Enhancer implant won't do anything more for you.
surprise|Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
joy|I heard that Caesar was killed by his own Lieutenants. I wonder if their infighting will give us a break for a while.
surprise|I bet I know where you went.
anger|I suppose if you must stick with your narrow, parochial view of "in charge," then yes, it's a no. Are we done?
neutral|He has no attachment to his men, no compunction about battlefield losses. All he cares about is destroying the enemy.
sadness|There's too much shit and despair at Gomorrah already. I don't want anybody making it worse for Jo... for the girls, you know?
surprise|Weird, someone just told me that the Khans split the Vegas area. Wonder where they went, and why.
neutral|All right. You've been a good dog, Lupa. Die well, girl.
neutral|So what are you doing here? Return to the Fort at once.
joy|Everyone wants a piece of their own personal heaven. So, they come here, for hours... and hours, hon.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
joy|I hope you're doing well, friend!
neutral|Then I don't need to tell you that they can be a pain in the ass.
fear|If House is dead, how'd the lights get turned on in his place, huh?
neutral|Having seen what you're capable of, I think you'd fight a horde of them and not bat an eye.
neutral|It was a crushing victory, but no one's heard a peep from the Brotherhood since. Most people assume the Brotherhood is scattered and not a threat.
joy|Hey there, champ. Good to see you again.
neutral|<snuffle!>
anger|Momma always told me not to talk to strangers, but you seem like a nice person.
neutral|That seems wise. I think I am, too. Although for how much longer, I'm not sure.
anger|What was that for?
joy|
joy|Glad to hear it, baby! My card - pass it on if you see any good acts out there.
fear|The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
neutral|That's all right.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
joy|I've heard of your fights at The Thorn. People down here don't stop talking about you.
joy|Heard there was a firefight in one of the big casinos. Maybe they'll need to buy more ammo now.
fear|What do you want with me?
joy|With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
joy|It's amazing that Kimball managed to survive.
neutral|NCR: Idolized.
neutral|You might be happy to know that your efforts haven't gone unnoticed, either.
neutral|Side bets are for losers. I'm playing to win.
neutral|All right. Thanks for all your help.
anger|You dirty coward!
surprise|Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
joy|This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
neutral|Certainly. Bottle caps do wear out or get damaged. Some people even insist on using bottle caps in explosive devices for some reason.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
disgust|It's good to have the Khans on our side, but I hope they keep them out of the Strip. Those savages smell like Bighorner's ass.
joy|Very well, feel free to ask me more about REPCONN at any time, don't be shy.
neutral|Uhh, hey. Welcome to Red Rock Canyon. You've seemed a little bipolar lately - maybe you're having withdrawal symptoms?
disgust|Your pet ghoul smells like ass.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
sadness|Folks just don't talk to other folks, and everybody's always cross with each other.
joy|Wow, the big celebrity down here with the common troopers. What can I do for you?
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
surprise|Got any more of those? I wanna blow something up too!
anger|Cut it out, will you?
joy|Another satisfied customer.
neutral|Here.
anger|Might want to watch the explosives, boss!
joy|I'm glad that the Legion base at Nelson is destroyed. Now maybe we can get some rest.
neutral|Yeah, yeah... me too. It's getting a bit late though, I should get going. Goodnight.
joy|Is that someone who needs me to kick their ass?
neutral|What's going on with the Remnants?
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
disgust|They're a tribe of fine warriors, with many proud traditions and a glorious history. They will be worthy additions to the Legion.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
fear|I've heard rumors that tribes who aligned with Caesar in the past were torn apart and reduced to slaves - prove it, and I'll back you.
neutral|All right, enough fun for tonight.
surprise|Huh?
anger|That's mine!
sadness|In a strictly official capacity, no.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
surprise|You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
anger|You seem to need an object lesson in democracy!
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
neutral|That's still a lot of money. I guess I'll take it.
neutral|My deadly Cazadores will test your limits.
joy|Jackpot, baby! I knew we'd see eye to eye!
anger|Because Papa listens to me. And because I actually know how to get things done around here.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
fear|So what happens now?
joy|I hope the Fiends have learned their lesson.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
neutral|Boomers: Rascal.
neutral|In the hands of the enemy-
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
surprise|Shouldn't you be securing supplies for us?
neutral|But you can get a bigger share if you risk your skin in The Thorn. Win a fight and I'll give you a meaty cut of the earnings.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
joy|I bet NCR troops can't wait to clean the sewers.
neutral|I mean you've first got to know yourself before you can truly know the gun.
fear|Yikes!
neutral|Hello Veronica. How goes your mission?
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
surprise|What in Maxson's name?
anger|I thought I had seen every species of moronic petty bullshit, but you've just topped the list. Congratulations.
surprise|Great, just when you think the NCR can't possibly sink their claws deeper, the town of Primm signs up to join the Republic.
neutral|They're a terrorist group, basically. Militant, quasi-religious fanatics obsessed with hoarding Pre-War technology.
fear|Someone's been picking off the leaders of the Fiends down in New Vegas. That's going to cut into our profits.
surprise|Whoa!
anger|I'm no Legionary, but I'll kill you all the same!
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
neutral|We radioed to confirm our orders but command didn't get what we were seeing. They told us to shoot till we were out of ammo. So that's what we did.
sadness|Maybe when this is all over, they'll find time to look after us.
neutral|We don't really use the chems ourselves, just sell them to anybody with the caps. If it ends up hurting the NCR in the process, that's a bonus.
joy|Oh, that makes me so happy! You are too much!
joy|Maybe I'll wander, like you.
fear|I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
joy|Anders told me what happened. We owe you one for rescuing him. Tell you what: I can give you caps as a thank you, or a special recipe Jack cooked up.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
joy|Benny is gonna show you the Tops! I hope you're built sturdy, you crazy broad!
anger|We'll get 'em.
anger|About goddamn time. Tell the Khans if they can't keep a steady supply, we'll find someone who can.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
sadness|I wish the rest of the Vault were accessible.
anger|Right. Easy enough. One... two... three!
anger|About three weeks ago I sent Anders southeast to find a route into Arizona to open new markets for our product.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
sadness|I heard President Kimball almost got killed during his visit to Hoover Dam. Good thing he didn't come here, he would be dead for sure.
anger|Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
neutral|Women are physically and intellectually inferior to men. Their role is to bear children and ensure the survival of our species.
surprise|Already on it. I whipped up a few Stimpaks already, but if you've got any more recipes I'll take them.
fear|Primm is going to be much tougher to push around with that new sheriff down there.
joy|I can't wait to see what fights next.
anger|Just let me know if you're available for the op. After what they did to Searchlight, they have a shitstorm coming.
neutral|But that all seems so limited now. We haven't grown or adapted. And now we're stuck in a hole, not carrying out our mission.
joy|That's very gracious of you. Again, you have my thanks.
joy|Wish I could've seen you capture those beasts for our Thorn!
fear|I hope my dad doesn't find out how much money those hookers cost me.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
disgust|Long time ago, now. I never even knew him. Ma always said he was a mysterious feller, always traveling on in secret.
joy|I'm glad to see you.
joy|Sure, boss.
joy|Another satisfied customer.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|I'm relieved to hear that President Kimball survived that assassination attempt.
anger|This stops right now.
sadness|Oh. No that wasn't really what we had in mind. We were hoping you would just, you know, help us. To be helpful.
surprise|Benny? Ahh, he's an all right cat, you dig? He don't got much musical talent, but he knows how to run a business. When he's around, anyways.
neutral|Finally! Let's get out of here!
joy|Haven't found any Radroaches, so far.
neutral|As much as the Profligates' cowardice will allow. They haven't found the balls to attack us here, but we catch them out on patrols.
joy|I take care of those who help with that. Here, you earned it.
joy|I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
joy|
joy|Any day, baby, any day.
disgust|Suit yourself.
sadness|It could be of great benefit to the people we try to help, many of whom suffer from hard to diagnose illnesses.
anger|You dirty coward!
sadness|I think he gets lonely standing around in that dino belly all day. He'll be glad for the company.
anger|Scram, will ya? I value my privacy.
neutral|Refugees at Bitter Springs are giving startling accounts of the legate known as Lanius who is said to be Caesar's top field commander.
anger|Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
neutral|Here's a compensation for your service. I trust that we're in agreement over it.
anger|They killed her!
neutral|So fucked up I can't feel my legs.
anger|What the hell?!
surprise|I heard you've killed Deathclaws at The Thorn. I couldn't believe it!
joy|I hadn't thought of that. Would you be willing to talk to them on our behalf?
sadness|I heard there was an attempt on President Kimball's life. I'm glad he's alright. Don't know what the NCR would do without him.
joy|We're the definition of cool, baby. We know how to swing. Folks come to us to learn how to enjoy themselves.
neutral|Come back when you have something to report.
neutral|Don't worry, you'll know him well when you serve him. Or you'll be dead.
neutral|It's the House edge, baby. The key to stacking the odds in his favor - or was, until I swiped it.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
neutral|Perhaps after today's battle, you too will earn yourself a new name.
joy|You better control thatthing. Bots can't be trusted.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
sadness|That's exactly my point, kid. Exactly my point.
joy|One of New Vegas' finest! You are always welcome in the Strip.
neutral|All clear!
neutral|One refugee told us the legate took over an underperforming squad of troops by beating its commander to death in full view of everyone.
neutral|Cass frequently trades with the NCR, so you'll likely find her at the Mojave Outpost.
anger|I'd kill you right now if I could.
anger|What the hell?!
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
neutral|I like long walks in the desert and candle-lit metal workshops.
surprise|You've taken down Cazadores! Didn't think I'd ever see that.
anger|Nah, Heck only knows greed and pain, kid. It's high time he got paid back in kind. His life, or his son's, either way I win.
anger|Grrrraah!
anger|Cut it out, will you?
neutral|Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
surprise|Found you!
sadness|There's barely enough equipment or medicine to handle the number of injuries we have.
anger|I thought the dam was boring. Then they stuck us out here to watch over this scrap heap.
anger|You can't do this to me! This is a mistake!
neutral|Ha! Perhaps I was wrong about your skills, Profligate. Your kill count rivals some of our best warriors!
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
anger|I hate it here, fucking sulfur stinks.
neutral|I can remember her face, but not her name. More than I can remember of my daddy, I guess. We lived in Westside before the Omertas bought me.
anger|Well, you took your sweet ass time coming here.
joy|Did you hear? We're going to join the Great Khans.
surprise|Hey!
anger|You dirty coward!
anger|Look, I don't know you at all and I'm not really interested in small talk. If you have something important to say, do so quickly.
neutral|Well, I've lived in Nevada all my life. Started out in New Reno, but headed down here as soon as I got the chance.
neutral|A lifetime supply of Fancy Lads Snack Cakes, revenge against my enemies, and world peace. In that order.
neutral|Come on, come on.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
sadness|I heard Quartermaster Mayes sent some guys out for supplies and they never came back. I wonder if they just ran off instead.
surprise|So far working with the NCR hasn't been too bad. If anything, things seem to be getting better.
disgust|It's not built to last. I'm just hastening the inevitable.
anger|We do the best we can. But still there's always some of you finicky types that there's just no pleasing.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
neutral|Prepare yourself, these Night Stalkers are hungry for blood.
joy|A Follower is always welcome among our people.
surprise|If the Legion can equip their men so well, maybe they can take care of me too.
neutral|More news for you.
surprise|Aha!
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
joy|Move it out, people. I want this place searched top to bottom.
neutral|Seen them grow from a single town - Shady Sands - into the republic. They've done good for the most part.
joy|Oh! Well I'm Alice and you've already met my beau, Dusty. He's sweet, ain't he? I don't care what my mama said, I know how to pick 'em.
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
neutral|President Kimball is arriving shortly. If you want to do any last minute security sweeps or take a look around for anything suspicious, do it now.
disgust|Murderer!
anger|Unless it's urgent you're going to have to wait. If it's gravely important, save me the trouble and empty your pockets now.
anger|You're not exactly making friends around here, are you?
fear|Guess it can't hurt to say hello.
neutral|Any assistance you can provide is welcome, and will mean more of our men to carve through the foe by your side.
fear|Were? What do you mean were?
surprise|Found you!
joy|Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
surprise|That's some serious atrophy, even for someone who's been in bed awhile. It's a wonder you can move at all.
neutral|That would be the NEMEAN Sub-Dermal Armor. It's a bit pricey - 8,000 caps - but the implant causes your skin cells to be bolstered with iron.
anger|We'll get 'em.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
fear|House signing up with the NCR, you hear? Fucking sell-out.
neutral|And?
anger|That does it.
anger|I'm... I don't know what's happening to me. I can't feel a goddamn thing anymore, empty and poisoned like the Wasteland.
surprise|I still can't believe the King agreed to work with the NCR. But he's the King, and the King knows best.
anger|Hey, you! What the hell are you doing? Keep snooping around here and I'll skin you like a fucking Gecko.
sadness|Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
neutral|All right, enough fun for tonight.
joy|The Followers are lucky to have a friend like you.
surprise|Mr. Bishop, well, he owed me a lot of money, and, y'know, he's a busy guy, so I sort of figured I'd just...take it off his hands.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
neutral|I sold it to a man not too long ago. Real twitchy, nervous sort of guy. Kinda seemed like he was wiggin' out about something.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
neutral|Have a seat. This will take awhile.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
anger|A bunch of closed-minded bullshit.
joy|That Caesar bastard had it coming.
joy|No problem. Glad I could help out.
joy|I'm afraid I'm quite good at killing things. You may want to run now.
fear|Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
neutral|Let's get going. I'd like to get my mind off all this. And some fresh air would do me some good right about now.
neutral|That's right, and good riddance.
neutral|A grateful widow told Radio New Vegas today of one person's heroic efforts to recover her husband's body from a war zone.
neutral|That's... brilliant. Simple, yet elegant. I can't believe I didn't think of that.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
joy|More fights, we want more.
joy|Thanks.
disgust|Better not try that again.
fear|You're some kind of hero, huh? I heard about how you saved the President's life. That's incredible.
surprise|Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
joy|I've been in politics quite a while now. Always had the drive to do it, even when I was young. It's just something I was drawn to.
anger|One of those beasts cut my friend in half! How the hell did they escape from Red Lucy?
anger|We are honest folk out there, damn hard to make a living in the desert, kid. Heck's a different breed, goddamn thief he is.
joy|You can't hide from me.
neutral|Made it out during Cooke's big prison break, like the rest of the guys here.
fear|Please no!
sadness|I heard the Legion took out another one of our patrols. If this continues there won't be many of us left.
fear|I really don't have anything you'd want.
neutral|Huh. I could've sworn I had that stupid bear on me. Well, tough luck for you, I guess.
joy|You're always welcome among the Followers, friend.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
disgust|Though they have been cruelly oppressed by the NCR, the Khans remain great warriors. The Legion is honored to have such allies in battle.
sadness|Hey, do you mind? I'm trying to drink myself to the ground, right here. Scram.
joy|That ugly mug with the razor tongue? Dig it baby, he'll be one hell of a novelty act. Just like Tommy promised, here's your 5%.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
neutral|You signed a contract to deliver the Platinum Chip, and you'll be paid when the delivery is made.
neutral|I want you to find them, and once you do, finish them for good. Any questions?
surprise|Don't worry, boss, with my cataracts you only sort of look like the bad guys.
joy|Nope. You'll just have to keep on wondering. Heh.
anger|Anything that's valuable. You done with the questions yet?
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
surprise|Holy shit!
neutral|The Legion's been sending raiding parties across the river in larger numbers lately. We don't have the men at this post to intercept them all.
neutral|I make sure any dangers to the people of North Vegas stay outside our barriers, stranger. Day and night, I stand watch.
neutral|We're finally to the point where the co-op members can start making money from sales instead of just breaking even.
surprise|I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
joy|The office terminal is locked, but you might have an easier time accessing it, especially at night.
joy|They've been a blessing.
sadness|Always a single bullet to the head, always from extreme range. We've lost eight refugees and three soldiers to this son of a bitch.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
neutral|A hostage crisis between the NCR and Great Khans was resolved peacefully when a third-party negotiator successfully secured the hostages' release.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
joy|That's because we are. We always pay up when the contract ends, though. Won't stay in business long if you've got a reputation as a cheat.
surprise|Hey, think you can walk around here like nothing's happened?
anger|Goddammit, I was nodding off until you barged in here! And I don't hurt when I sleep!
anger|I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
neutral|Their sentimentality prevents them from administering justice.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
disgust|You know, I was just thinking the same thing about you.
joy|And you dig this is just first base, right? You and me have a future together, and it's big league and open all night.
anger|Grrrraah!
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
surprise|Huh?
joy|You're the one who saved us! Thank you.
joy|You can't hide from me.
neutral|That's a motive I can understand.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
neutral|Well, thanks for the tip, but we'll need more evidence. Talk to Boyd at McCarran.
neutral|I swear the monorail was *just* ahead... somewhere.
joy|Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
neutral|I wouldn't dismiss it that lightly, but it's nothing we need get involved with for now. Good work, I suppose.
anger|No!
neutral|They're all yours. I sincerely hope they work better for you than they did for me.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
surprise|Word is those tough guys rangers are here. I ain't seen them myself, but how scary can they be?
neutral|Uhh, hey. Welcome to Red Rock Canyon. You've seemed a little bipolar lately - maybe you're having withdrawal symptoms?
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
joy|I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
anger|Let's paint this place red.
sadness|Eventually got caught somewhere around the Hub, back in NCR. Boy, they sure treated him mean down there. Cut him up so bad he can't talk no more.
neutral|Either way, the job's not done until they've cleared out of the town.
surprise|Aha!
neutral|Yeah. I don't know much. Just rumors.
neutral|This is the best gun in the whole galaxy. I paid a million caps for it. And it wasn't even brand new.
neutral|Even if I trusted you I'd not share my secrets just for your pretty face, stranger.
neutral|Eyewitnesses report seeing roving bands of troops wearing power armor and carrying advanced weapons along the 95.
neutral|If I implant the Probability Calculator in your frontal lobe, you'll be able to calculate odds a little better.
neutral|We were trying to get away when the legion showed up. I'm glad he ran off like a coward, but slavery wasn't the kind of escape I was looking for.
anger|Now I ain't no optometrist, but maybe we should fit you for some glasses while you're here.
surprise|Hey!
disgust|Of course I'm aware. It's a distress call. This camp is in bad shape, and if we don't get relief soon, I don't know what will happen.
surprise|Holy fuck. Never seen a mutant like that before.
joy|A Ranger, here in the Strip? Fine company, sir!
joy|Now you're talking! That is the ring-a-ding move, baby.
anger|Come on, people, I need a target!
joy|You've made it! Thank you so much for your help. I owe you more than- Wait! What's that?
disgust|I've had to increase security around the Strip due to the President's assassination. I can barely believe he's dead myself.
surprise|What?! Why won't you tell me?
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
neutral|Okay. This will just take a moment.
anger|As if that wasn't enough, someone's been coming out of the mountains at night, stealing supplies and picking off my people.
sadness|Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
neutral|Anything I needed to worry about, baby, got confiscated at the door.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
anger|We didn't get all of them. Talk later!
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
joy|They did? That's great! Thank you! I'm out of this crummy camp!
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
neutral|You know where to find me, friend.
joy|NCR came all the way to save us, huh? Guess they missed the shit-holes.
joy|Come with me. I'll see you out.
fear|Careful!
joy|Yes. This time my Legionaries will be more frightened of the commander behind them than the enemy before them.
joy|Oh and take these radiation supplies. You'll need them.
joy|Leather suits are good times! Thinking about that just blows my top!
neutral|What's your reputation at Goodsprings?
anger|Why don't you just move on to another town?
anger|Sorry, I'm busy right now.
joy|Good. You'll be a Legionary yet.
neutral|Why would it bother me to enslave these wretches? They have no purpose, no creed, no honor.
joy|Thank you. Any help you can give would be a godsend.
neutral|Diners at the Gourmand are giving the restaurant rave reviews for executive chef Phillipe's brand new menu offerings.
joy|I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
neutral|Only NCR engineers or people with explicit permission from Ranger Grant are allowed roof access.
joy|I hope Red Lucy gives us the *big* monsters, next.
joy|I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
neutral|Sure, go ahead.
disgust|Careless of the NCR to let their monorail get blown up. Don't they have sentries standing watch?
neutral|VStoryEventLegionHowitzer set to 1.
joy|Another satisfied customer.
surprise|Someone got Mr. House. The Strip's going to change, I'd bet on it.
surprise|I heard President Kimball almost got killed at Hoover Dam. That would have been a big blow to morale around here.
disgust|Going to run out of friends at the rate you're going.
neutral|Okay, what's on your mind?
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
joy|I'm Doc Mitchell. Welcome to Goodsprings.
anger|Did I say I blamed society? I know why I'm here, baby. Do you?
fear|I'm not scared of you. Give me a good reason to call the law and, I swear, you'll regret it.
joy|I sometimes see him wandering around the camp. Though he seems to need more time to himself. His cot's still empty when I return after midnight.
disgust|You don't seem to take a hint. Get out of my face.
neutral|She's locked the bedroom door - like that's going to stop me. I was... I've got a gun, I'm going to make her give it to me!
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
neutral|Crazy, right? Or is it? I'm gonna find somebody smart and ask him that question, see what he says. It'll be fucking intense.
neutral|Once we get started, we're going to be on a tight schedule. Are you ready to do this?
anger|No! You cursed bitch!
fear|One of my buddies said that he saw Caesar out rallying the Legion. If that's true, we're definitely screwed.
disgust|Yeah? What else you got?
neutral|Keep moving!
anger|Cut it out, will you?
fear|Believe me, I'd love to leave, but I can't because I don't know what effect the radiation will have on me.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
disgust|You bastard!
joy|I heard from Dr. Richards. I'm glad you were at least some use to him.
disgust|Join? Oh, no, I simply couldn't. That is... I'm not worthy of such an honor.
sadness|Been better, been worse. When I first came here there was but one turbine spinning.
neutral|As bad as it can be some days in here, it's better than living in that dump.
sadness|I'm gonna miss having Anderson around.
neutral|All right.
joy|Have you seen what one of those anti-materiel rifles can do to a Deathclaw?
surprise|What the-?
neutral|Why's everything spinning?
joy|Welcome back! Interested in a tour of the REPCONN museum? Or did you have a question about the company I could answer?
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
joy|Thanks.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
sadness|...we'll never stop them, not at this rate. We're doomed. Thanks for bringing the word - even if the news is bad, I'll let the men know.
neutral|That looks like all of them.
neutral|The right weapons for my kind of customer.
disgust|Between having to hire protection and getting slapped with taxes, it's more profitable to stick to Arizona and New Mexico.
surprise|We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
fear|Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
anger|What the hell?!
disgust|I'm always eager for more of your scintillating conversation, boss.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
anger|In exchange for great Caesar's promise of all the lands west of New Vegas, the Khans have agreed to fight alongside the Legion when the time comes.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
joy|The maize is doing well in this soil.
fear|I'm getting out of here.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
surprise|Aha!
joy|That Fiend leader got what he fucking deserved.
fear|I don't want any trouble, okay?
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
disgust|Anybody ever tell you your sense of humor stinks? I'll let it go this time, but you watch your mouth from now on.
anger|You loser! You had Vegas in the palm of your hand and you threw it away?
joy|Hi! I'm Sarah, Sarah Weintraub. Welcome to the finest Vault hotel in the whole world!
neutral|A large unidentified aircraft has been seen circling the skies above the New Vegas Strip.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
neutral|I've told her about the risks, and she still insists on helping me.
fear|So what happens now?
neutral|It's a lot of territory to secure. Too much, even for a big army like the NCR's.
anger|Damn right it is. Now let's get going.
sadness|We'll miss Red Lucy down here.
joy|A friend of mine at the Dam says President Kimball might visit the troops out there. Imagine shaking the president's hand!
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
joy|When traffic dried up, we took to our heels to find us some customers. I'm not one to sit around waiting to get saved, and Michelle ain't, neither.
joy|Lady Luck smiled on our President.
disgust|Nothing close to what we got here at the Tops, that's for sure.
joy|A nice guy came up and asked me if I wanted to join the NCR so I did. Now the Troopers are my family. I like it here. Everyone is so nice.
anger|What on earth could push you to destroy Forlorn Hope?
neutral|If you like news, you're gonna love our next segment.
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
neutral|Crap, those goody-goodies kicked me out of there once already. No way I'm getting in.
fear|Okay, if you say so. Hell, it's not like we've got a lot to lose here.
joy|But baby - you'd be disappointing me. All the trouble you went through to arrange this shin-dig? Must be something more you're after...?
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
disgust|Well, at least you're honest, I guess. Sorry, I just don't take charity from strangers.
anger|We'll get 'em.
neutral|This next song helped me through a very difficult time in my life. I hope one day it can do the same for you.
joy|Of the three families, we're the only ones with the heart and savoir-faire to run the Strip on our own.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|Looks like someone wants to be neighborly.
joy|Thanks.
neutral|Well, a bunker, if you want to get technical. I think it sounds more interesting my way.
surprise|Are you leaving... just like that?
neutral|The NCR likes to keep tabs on the activities of the families, and they pay me good caps to hang around the casinos and keep my ears open.
anger|That's... great? So there was a problem, after all. Huh. Well, I'm not a scientist, so it's not my fault if I didn't see anything wrong.
surprise|Holy fuck. Never seen a mutant like that before.
anger|You should've paid your dues, but, no, you had to play hard, huh? Now it's our turn.
surprise|Holy shit!
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
sadness|I know that this place was originally a mining town before the NCR took it over.  I think they mined gold before the war.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
joy|This area clear. Proceeding with search protocol.
anger|Get lost.
joy|Hahaha! Yeeeehaw! Now, that's something I thought I'd never hear.
anger|That's not a good idea.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
neutral|Good, his death could have had a major impact on morale. This whole affair was ill-advised from the start, and I for one am glad it's over.
anger|You sick bastard. You'd better be ready to join her.
surprise|Hey!
anger|Bah. Looks like I forgot to lock the doors again. If you're with the NCR, get out. This place is mine, and I'm not leaving.
anger|What makes you think I give a damn about you?
neutral|What about Benny?
neutral|Uhh, hey. Welcome to Red Rock Canyon. You've seemed a little bipolar lately - maybe you're having withdrawal symptoms?
anger|This job's boring enough without talking to you. Go see Alexander.
joy|Hello, sir.
neutral|I'm trying to open your eyes.
anger|Dammit, I thought I had you there. Let's play again.
surprise|Right on, let's have it!
neutral|I'm working on some top secret shit I can't even tell you about, it's so mind-blowing.
anger|I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
surprise|Huh?
joy|The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
neutral|Here in Freeside, we provide food and medical services for those in need. We have also organized reconstruction efforts.
disgust|Dude... wait, what? That's totally kakadoodle, man. You been huffing fumes in the Magic Bus or something?
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
neutral|If there's any chance you can free us, it's worth the risk...
neutral|All of us here are sworn to obey and protect the Codex, even against one of our own. She's gone too far this time.
surprise|Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
surprise|Aha!
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
joy|You're the courier I've heard so much about. My squad needs your assistance.
anger|And I'm supposed to be part of those dreams? What about my dreams, stranger? What about me?
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
fear|Oh, uh, it ain't even a thing. Forget I even said it.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
neutral|How are those readings looking, Calamity?
disgust|Suit yourself. Let me know if you change your mind.
joy|I don't know how you did it, but thank you.
joy|More fights, we want more.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
anger|Got you!
neutral|Sure.
surprise|Can you imagine how much electricity it takes to keep this Vault running?
joy|I'm pretty excited. He seems like such a nice guy and I get to meet him.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
joy|Theeeere you are.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
neutral|Yes.
neutral|
neutral|Man, what aren't my responsibilities? Dam overflow, dam underflow. Dam leakage. Sometimes the dam gets too big and I have to shrink it down.
neutral|Well, somebody begged. Couldn't say who for sure. It's all a blur, you know? Chems, man. What a trip.
neutral|Like what?
neutral|VStoryEventSecuritronsFort set to 0.
surprise|Word is those tough guys rangers are here. I ain't seen them myself, but how scary can they be?
surprise|What in the goddamn...?
neutral|Here, this is edible.
neutral|I got a pressure in me like Hoover Dam.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
neutral|Not much, I'm afraid. What do you want to know?
neutral|Maybe this group had something to do with attacking Brahmin, maybe not. Doesn't matter. We're getting paid to make them go away.
neutral|So long, stranger.
disgust|I heard Private Stone was caught stealing medical supplies. I always hated that guy.
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
joy|Maybe now I can get my old life back, or at least most of it.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|Lady Luck smiled on our President.
neutral|We're not going to die of thirst any time soon, but I'd rather have too much than not enough.
neutral|On how many can you take, stranger?
disgust|Sure, why not? Nothing left for me here since Garret's dead.
sadness|Maybe stupid head voice was right?
disgust|The Legion is using our dead troops as booby traps. I'd think twice before rushing to someone's aid.
joy|It's good to see you around the Strip.
neutral|VStoryEventNelson set to 0.
joy|I hope Red Lucy gives us the *big* monsters, next.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
neutral|We're talking about a coterie of bulging-eyed fanatics who think all Pre-War technology belongs to them.
neutral|What's your reputation with the Followers?
joy|After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
joy|There's nothing else like The Thorn!
anger|Go ahead, try that. And I'll have you hunted down, and your head mounted on a pole. Now get to it. Vale.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
anger|I've lost all respect for you.
anger|No!
neutral|Yes, yes.
surprise|The tables turned for Mr. House. What next, huh?
surprise|People lived in here for hundreds of years, can you imagine?
joy|Hello again. Well, this is my place now. With time, I'll turn it into a good home.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
anger|What do you want?
joy|Bull not as smart as he thinks! Can't see dogs around him.
joy|I brush it every day. One hundred brushes.
surprise|Well, there's Dinky, the town mascot. He's a sight. You probably already saw him when you came in, but you can go up inside, too.
neutral|Thanks. Take this keycard - I tried hacking the locking mechanisms on the doors, but it seems that the only way in is with one of these.
neutral|A source within the Great Khans is saying the gang has reached an accord with the NCR, and will support them in any conflict with Caesar's Legion.
joy|Well, with that over with and the Legion forces at Nelson defeated, we finally have some breathing room.
neutral|There will time for questions and answers once you've delivered the Chip. Until then, you'll have to tolerate your ignorance... just as I do.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
anger|We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
neutral|You think I haven't tried? Every time I do, Camp Golf acknowledges the situation. And soon after that, more ammo.
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
joy|Now that you've killed that Caesar bastard, the Strip's really going to bloom!
joy|Let me know if you need anything else.
sadness|We'll miss Red Lucy down here.
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
neutral|I think that they found someplace to hide close to HELIOS, and never went that far at all. Any other questions?
anger|I thought the dam was boring. Then they stuck us out here to watch over this scrap heap.
neutral|They had some of the plant running, but they shut it all down. Enabled an old security system, too, to keep us away from the controls. Jerkoffs.
anger|Suffering? I may be suffering but I still want to live. You tell that bastard that I have every intention of doing so.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
sadness|Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
neutral|We don't need vegetables, and besides, they spoil. The meat you can dry and turn into jerky.
neutral|Didn't have much hand-to-hand training, so our chances are better if you keep the enemy out of my face.
surprise|Huh?
sadness|Yes, some years back we taught them reading, writing, basic science - we hoped they would use it to make medical supplies, but they turned to drugs.
joy|We each serve the Legion, in our way.
neutral|Sure do. Came from The Hub on account of the Thaler Act. Farming's decent work, but the whole thing's a bum deal.
neutral|On how many can you take, stranger?
anger|Find the enemy commander, this General Oliver. Kill him or his resolve. Do this, and his cowards will retreat, leaving the dam to us.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
disgust|Are you afraid of me? You should be because I'm going to kick your ass when I find you!
neutral|Vale.
neutral|More or less. Supposedly it's a vegetation enhancer. NCR has a science branch headquartered at McCarran airport. Guess they found something.
anger|We Followers aren't pushovers!
surprise|NCR is going to be rip shit about losing their little train.
surprise|Great, just when you think the NCR can't possibly sink their claws deeper, the town of Primm signs up to join the Republic.
disgust|If you say so.
fear|I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
surprise|Right on, let's have it!
anger|You'll still have to deal with Benny's private goon squad, though. I got no play with those cats. You want more help, I'll need more proof.
neutral|Let's test your mettle.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
neutral|What do you think I should do with them? Bury 'em or something?
neutral|Here's your NCR money. Will there be anything else?
surprise|Hey!
neutral|I... I don't know what I want. But I hate this place, and I hate these people.
neutral|I can hardly stand the excitement.
anger|Time to die!
surprise|Wh-? Guards!
surprise|The Khans used to be a big deal around here, but look at them now. There's talk that they were all killed up in the mountains.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
neutral|The mysterious deaths of several old men around New Vegas, including a doctor, have led some to suspect a serial killer may be responsible.
neutral|You do that.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
sadness|Can't help thinking that we've not seen the last of the Fiends yet.
joy|Pleasure doing business with you.
anger|You oughta die for what you did.
joy|It's amazing that Kimball managed to survive.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
sadness|Can't help thinking that we've not seen the last of the Fiends yet.
fear|I don't know much about what's going on outside, aside from the creatures that moved in since then.
joy|When he sees the Profligates losing this battle, however, he might throw his support behind them. Except he won't, because he'll be dead.
joy|Howdy, come try your luck? I hope's on your side.
sadness|Those were good men at the station. Good men. This whole town was sleeping a lot easier because of them.
sadness|You know what? Forget it, it doesn't matter. Welcome to Camp Searchlight, the shittiest place on earth.
neutral|Carry on.
fear|Whoa, hey now, kid, that's some kind of serious charge you're dropping. You want to be real careful what you say next.
joy|I'll give you some caps for each one you bring back to me. There's an old rifle in it for you if you can bring me at least 10.
fear|Caesar's death is good news for the NCR. For everyone, most likely.
joy|Thanks.
fear|I give up!
joy|He accepted... on condition that he be allowed to kill the surviving males of his tribe. I said, make it the adult males and you have a deal.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
neutral|But I'm still here and nothing's changed.
neutral|All right, let's see here... neural pathways look good... definitely a breed of guard dog.
anger|True to Caesar.
neutral|Stand tall and walk straight, you idiots are giving us a bad name.
neutral|You've done enough to last many lifetimes, stranger. But... I'd like you to come see me, again.
anger|Hah! The Great Khans will not be slaves. Caesar himself has promised us the land from here to the Colorado and the freedom to raid as we see fit.
joy|I don't mean to be insensitive, but you really can't win.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|Perhaps I do have a secret tunnel out of here. But that doesn't change anything. My duty is to stay and fight.
neutral|Yeah, you are different from my usual guys. Fine, fifty caps, but don't tell anyone.
surprise|No, no, no! Leo does the chopping, not you, dearie!
joy|I heard you won Private Sexton's Legion killing contest. Nice job, that'll teach those Legion bastards!
neutral|Just making some deliveries to the troops here in Primm. I'm stationed in California, but I come across the border a couple times a month.
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
surprise|The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
disgust|Wouldn't want to live forever if I had to look like a ghoul.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
joy|You can't hide from me.
anger|Damn!
joy|Almost done here. What do you say you have a look at this? Tell me what you see.
neutral|A group of Great Khans were killed in a bloody end to a hostage crisis in Boulder City. It's not currently known why the Khans were in the area.
anger|Nobody screws with the Gun Runners and walks away from it!
anger|Maybe I will. Or maybe I'll just ask him why he left. Hell, the more I talk about it, the more the whole damn thing sounds like a dumb idea.
joy|Good timing. Looks like his Vertibird is arriving early. Here it comes now.
anger|We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
neutral|Coming east was about securing the land, so people could live without fear.
neutral|It'll be a pitched battle, that's a certainty. Perhaps the greatest battle the Earth has seen since the human race nearly made itself extinct.
neutral|Well that's too bad. I'm just here to enjoy the show so if you don't mind...
anger|Damn!
joy|Oh, thank you! Thank you!
surprise|Hey!
neutral|Sure.
neutral|VStoryEventBennySeen set to 2.
surprise|You cashed out the old man? So how's it feel to end an era?
neutral|That's one of the least trustworthy lines I've ever heard. Sorry. No can do.
neutral|Are you trying to shame me?
surprise|I do what now? Uhh... I mean, yeah, I sometimes need to... stretch my legs. Helps me... uh... think.
joy|Every night from eight till midnight, come on by to see the Rad Pack Revue live, only right here at the Aces Theater!
joy|But it also leads to some of my best competition ideas. Wanna hear one?
anger|I should kill you myself for what you did to Kimball, and fuck the law!
joy|Here, take this. I hope you put it to good use.
surprise|Nothing. Must be nerves.
joy|According to the notes you gave me, all of the southern raiding parties come from that camp. Caesar regularly sends fresh squads to relieve patrols.
anger|I really don't want to deal with this right now.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
neutral|You go clear them out for us, and there'll be some caps for you.
neutral|We have unconfirmed reports that Caesar has died in his base camp after a failed surgery, performed by an unknown and possibly unqualified surgeon.
neutral|That's it, keep moving.
anger|Down to brass tacks. How'd your meet and greet with Baldie go?
surprise|What?! How did you pull it off?
joy|Food from the people and for the people. Anyone can buy, but the profits are shared by the folks who make the produce.
anger|We need to go now!
fear|Aaaah!
anger|Leave me out of your fight!
sadness|Oh... okay. I'll be around if you change your mind.
neutral|Look alive, guys, you're on NCR time.
surprise|Hello! The guy everyone saw go in the Lucky 38, that was you? Oh shit.
fear|Brought too many bullets and not enough stimpaks!
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
neutral|What's your reputation with the Great Khans?
joy|You can't hide from me.
sadness|Without any medical experience, you're not going to be much use to me in here.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
joy|Hot damn do I love this place.
fear|Shiny screens go dark. Stupid head voice have no use for shiny screens.
joy|Ring-a-ding, baby! Ta-ta!
anger|This place stinks!
sadness|I'm not programmed to fail. Just so you know.
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
anger|Then this is endsville, baby - may the best man win.
neutral|We're fighting a war for a lost cause. If we're going to survive, we have to find a role in society. Attract new members.
sadness|Sorry, son. I fixed up your head as best I knew how. I guess I missed a spot.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
anger|Got my attention.
neutral|Are you... going to spank us? I *so* love handcuffs!
neutral|Is there a place to grab food by the monorail?
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
neutral|Yes, goddamn it, it is. But you're going to hear me out this time.
joy|Hey. Anything going on?
fear|Yeah, I know I wouldn't sign up for that solo op if asked.
neutral|Well, the Gun Runners continue to dominate the weapons market, and the Mormon traders from New Canaan control the majority of the northern routes.
joy|Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
joy|Better now that all those Legion troops in Nelson are dead. The NCR might actually have a chance of kicking their asses after all.
surprise|Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
sadness|They were better equipped, and we could not stand against them.
surprise|What in Maxson's name?
surprise|Huh?
neutral|Once I was across, I changed into a uniform I swiped off a dead Legionary outside Nelson. Tried to sneak into the bunker, but that didn't work out.
joy|Here's a little tink-tink to weight your pockets.
joy|I am so pleased you enjoyed the last tour! A new tour will begin in a moment, if you wish to wait.
neutral|I think it is safe to move up.
fear|Damn it all to hell!
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
disgust|Fuck, where are we gonna get our shit from now that the Khans are all buddy buddy with the NCR.
neutral|That's not a bargain I can accept. Westside depends on that water for survival and self-reliance.
anger|Sorry, I'm busy right now.
neutral|No. It's not. ARCHIMEDES II is an orbital laser. Effective only outdoors in a limited radius and requiring a long recharge.
anger|They expand, fast. If you've got land they want, they'll take it, eventually. Did it out West, they'll do it here.
anger|What do you need?
neutral|We found a gun that disables power armor. One of these could defeat the whole Brotherhood.
anger|God damn it! I just spoke to them the other day. If this is some kind of sick joke-
neutral|He used to go on and on about water and the farms east of the Strip. He was talking to one of the farmers named Bascom, had some problem with NCR.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
joy|Nice work at the Tops buddy.
neutral|Here's your NCR money. Will there be anything else?
neutral|What do you need to know?
surprise|Put that down!
joy|You want to gamble with class? Hit the Ultra-Luxe, if you don't mind being serviced by masked creeps.
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
neutral|Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
anger|Gee, I dunno, maybe because I'm saddled with the worst damn unit in the NCR Army? Think that might have something to do with it?
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
surprise|What mission, what are you talking about?
sadness|It all used to be so simple. Why did they change? Why can't they see my pain?
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|Did you hear about the Legion Defeat at Nelson? We're winning back our territories.
fear|Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
joy|So, our President's savior is enjoying a well deserved R&R? Fine piece of work you are!
sadness|Ah well. It was worth a shot.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
joy|Without leadership, the Fiends are as good as dead!
joy|Have you changed your mind? Are you willing to help me out with something real simple?
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
neutral|So long, stranger.
sadness|That's too bad. If you change your mind, let me know.
anger|And so you wiped out the garrison I placed at Nelson? That strategically vital garrison? What else?
joy|We owe you so much for saving our President.
neutral|Amazes me people would come from all over the wastes to throw away everything they've got in that town.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
joy|He's the reason the Strip shines like a star at night. Mike's imagined and built every sign, billboard and light you'll see around here.
joy|Thanks.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
sadness|I'll miss you. Please come back and see me again.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
anger|That's against regulations!
surprise|Holy shit!
surprise|Uh... is there something I can help you with?
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
surprise|Whoa!
anger|You sick bastard. You'd better be ready to join him.
neutral|But when everybody came back nobody would tell me what happened. And people would call us murderers sometimes when we showed up to secure towns.
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
fear|Boss, why are you looking at me that way?
neutral|You'll be allowed to carry your weapons, but they must remain holstered.
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
anger|Sweetie, if you want something, just ask grandma politely.
anger|You better scram before I sic the entire Strip after you.
joy|That would definitely be appreciated. You might want to ask around and keep an eye out for anything suspicious.
fear|Motor Runner dead? Who the fuck gonna run the show now?
joy|I've been hearing a lot of good things about you. What's up?
surprise|The bots have enough firepower to arm a full platoon.
fear|If I have to pull another double shift again I'm going to collapse from exhaustion.
sadness|I lost everything I had at The Tops, but if you gave me 500 caps, I'd head straight back. Sick, huh?
joy|Here you go. Put it to good use.
joy|Looks like they're planning to shift their raids north of Vegas. I'll shift some of the rangers and NCR patrols in that direction when they're free.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
sadness|Oh. Oh, I see. Well... thank you for saving the rest, at least.
neutral|The Strip: Wild Child.
surprise|The big showdown between the NCR and the Legion is coming soon, believe you me.
neutral|You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
joy|NCR should take this chance, now that Mr. House's out of the way.
anger|Some fool troopers think they can lounge around on the rooftops instead of doing their job. If I catch them, they'll have KP duty for a year.
joy|Prepared already. I like it. There's no need to give me the details, it's probably best that way.
neutral|This from the girl who walked from I-15 to the Colorado River looking for her lost package.
neutral|The Platinum Chip unlocks this bunker. Hence, you have it.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
neutral|Oh, all right.
sadness|This place has come a long way, but ever since Sarah's death it is not the same.
anger|The ground in Forlorn Hope was soaked red, from the blood of our own people!
neutral|You got the future of Vegas in the palm of your hand, baby. What happens next is up to you.
disgust|That doesn't... why would he pull a stunt like that? Got anything else to offer?
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
disgust|It's the main base for the NCR, and a breeding ground for oppression in the name of patriotic bullshit. Do humanity a favor and blow it up.
neutral|Since 2278, I've lost five roaming Securitrons near Hidden Valley.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
anger|Damn!
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
anger|Mars's eyes are upon you. Do not fail him - or us.
joy|How's that sound?
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
neutral|Okay.
anger|Damn it!
neutral|Come on, come on.
fear|I don't know what you have against the Followers, but I don't want any trouble.
neutral|It is the armor of a Centurion. You have the rare honor of beholding it unspattered by the blood of my inferiors.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
neutral|Things guards can't spot when they're patting you down or checking for iron at your hip.
surprise|Huh?
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
anger|We think it was the Brotherhood of Steel - those crazies always go hard for energy weapons. But the NCR would rather pretend they killed all of them.
anger|You better scram before I sic the entire Strip after you.
anger|Dammit, I thought I had you there. Let's play again.
anger|You die now!
neutral|Once I had enough, I made a necklace out of them, since I thought they were lucky.
joy|Heard there was a firefight in one of the big casinos. Maybe they'll need to buy more ammo now.
sadness|I'm sorry that you think so. However, if you do happen to change your mind, you can find me here at the embassy.
surprise|Found you!
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
neutral|It documents our history, too. Part of what Scribes like me do is update it. Hmm... I wonder...
joy|And don't think I forgot your pay. A job well done is its own reward, but it doesn't pay for pussy at the local brothel, does it?
anger|Had enough?
neutral|They occupied Nellis Air Force Base a little over 50 years ago. One of my Securitrons got some video of their arrival - and then... exploded.
surprise|What in Maxson's name?
sadness|I understand the esteemed Chief Hanlon is no longer with us. A shame. He seemed to be the only competent leadership this Army had.
neutral|I told them that when Legionaries are disloyal, some are punished, the others made to watch. And I announced the lottery.
neutral|That looks like all of them.
fear|Don't get me wrong, that resort of theirs is ring-a-ding, but my guts say, "don't go in the basement."
neutral|Nice work catching this. I'll have my Rangers go deal with this man right away.
anger|Special or not, stay out of trouble and more importantly stay out of my way.
surprise|Aha!
joy|You'd have to talk to them - but those two have been thick as thieves since they were kids. Convince one and the other will come around.
neutral|Very well.
disgust|Don't you dare mention the NCR under this roof. They are butchers without honor, killers of women and children!
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
surprise|Aha!
joy|This is incredibly good. Here's your omelet, and the recipe if you ever want to make your own. It takes a bit of skill to get it tasting right.
anger|Don't listen to a word No-bark says. He spouts nothing but nonsense.
disgust|Careless of the NCR to let their monorail get blown up. Don't they have sentries standing watch?
anger|I'll kill you for that!
joy|NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
neutral|And actually these days I think they'd rather have me out here anyway. But that's a whole other story.
neutral|She talked a lot. Suited me fine - I never know what to say. And listening to her, it could... make you forget.
neutral|Then ask them. But don't waste my time. The battle draws near.
anger|They killed him!
joy|Just as my namesake campaigned in Gaul before he crossed the Rubicon, so have I campaigned, and will cross the Colorado.
neutral|Some of the computers still work, but the only files are diaries and garbage. Typical vault.
joy|I think she was about your size, and she hardly wore it after we left the vault. Felt it was too brazen.
anger|Damn!
surprise|My god!
neutral|Well, if you know what you're doing... okay. You show me a good time, and I'll return the favor.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
anger|Come back when you know more about the White Glove Society.
anger|I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
anger|Just be careful. You don't want to cause a scene before Kimball even shows up.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
neutral|Thank you!
anger|I moved her into Gomorrah. I was in love, okay? Then Cachino, backstabbing snake, got me out of the way so that he could have my girl.
sadness|Fight's over. Back to boring walking around.
anger|That's how we do things in the U.S. army! Hoo-ah!
fear|I hope my dad doesn't find out how much money those hookers cost me.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|NCR: Shunned. Shhhhhuuuuuunnnnn!
anger|You will be avenged, Brother.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
anger|What was that for?
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
joy|The beasts don't look so tough behind bars, huh?
joy|Hell, it sounds like the perfect time to get even. Heck won't know what hit him, what do you say?
disgust|It's good to have the Khans on our side, but I hope they keep them out of the Strip. Those savages smell like Bighorner's ass.
surprise|Is that so! I'll have to talk to Major Polatli about this right away.
fear|
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
neutral|<Sighs> Dang it. I could've used one of those.
anger|What gives him the right to screw us with the royal shaft, anyway? So, he saved New Vegas. Wohooo! Now scram and let us go on with our lives! Sheesh!
surprise|You mean like the last time you told me to do that, boss?
fear|Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
anger|What the hell do you want?
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|Sure.
disgust|You've been with the Family long enough to know how this goes. I'm sorry you had to fuck this up. Goodbye, you were a real benefit to the business.
neutral|But you should wait until the bunker's taken care of. Caesar won't like it if you eat dessert first.
joy|It's about damn time. You ready to go?
anger|Vegas gotta swing, baby, gotta have pizzazz. Respect where due, but that old man is square to the core.
joy|I've heard of your fights at The Thorn. People down here don't stop talking about you.
joy|Good. Kimball is scheduled to give his speech tomorrow. We'll rest here tonight and talk the plan over first thing in the morning.
joy|Another satisfied customer.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
neutral|Wait for me downstairs, this won't take long.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
fear|I've heard stories about you. No one knows what you'll do next.
fear|Run! Beasts got free!
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
neutral|What of it?
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|Bye.
neutral|All this is just work ethic run wild, that's your line? I don't know...
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
anger|Fighting was part of my studies.
anger|They found the Chip. I wasn't gonna tell them what it was used for, but... let's just say they were persuasive.
neutral|Very well. Lucullus, escort this fool back to Cottonwood Cove.
joy|Should've run, now say your prayers.
surprise|Whoa!
surprise|Fiends don't come here no more, they say.
joy|As for the men, they'll recover soon and be back on the front lines in no time. Ahh... the circle of life.
neutral|The old woman's dried up, but she could keep house or do gardening - if she can learn to keep her mouth shut.
neutral|This is a dead end for us.
anger|Damn!
neutral|I'm still passionate about my work though. Otherwise I wouldn't be here.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
joy|Here's the package - good luck. Your payment will be waiting when you get back.
joy|One of New Vegas' finest! You are always welcome in the Strip.
surprise|Woah boy! This puts you far ahead of everyone else. I think I'll have to declare you the winner of the competition.
anger|What the hell?!
anger|Men have waged war on each other for countless centuries. Now is no different.
neutral|Novac: Shunned.
neutral|Check out the digs. Real cozy in here.
joy|I wanted to thank you again for saving my patients. It's nice to have a helping hand around here.
anger|You better have a good reason for being here.
neutral|Promotional consideration for this news segment has been paid for by the Ultra-Luxe. The Ultra-Luxe. Live life in the lap of luxury.
fear|Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
fear|Uh oh.
fear|Huh. Guess that makes me the boss. Ring-a-ding.
anger|You've got a lot of nerve showing your face around here. You're lucky I don't shoot you right now.
neutral|Listen to me, very carefully. I've waited too long for this moment for you to go fouling it up on a lark.
anger|That's not a good idea.
joy|No problem, here you go. I'm kind of amazed you found them at all. Thanks again for everything.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
joy|Okay. See you soon!
neutral|Here.
neutral|We've got some news for you, coming right up.
disgust|For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
neutral|Legion!
joy|NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
anger|What have you done?
surprise|What on earth is *that* creature?
joy|A pleasure doing business with you.
anger|Bad idea.
joy|Did you hear? Gomorrah's under new management!
joy|Great. Since the camp is threatened by Legion, I propose a hunt. Kill any you encounter and bring me the Legion's ear as proof.
neutral|Long story, so here's the short version. The Master created the Super Mutants and Nightkin.
joy|Sometimes they stop by, tell me they're paying their respects, the smug bastards.
neutral|What? This? He stole this from me at gunpoint. Lucky for me, he got distracted and I got a chance to draw on him.
anger|You dirty coward!
neutral|I see. Thanks for saving us the trouble.
anger|Keep your hands to yourself!
surprise|Again? All right.
anger|Had enough?
anger|Got 'em!
anger|No!
sadness|Don't think I'll make it topside any time soon.
sadness|This spirit of forgiveness you're showing me... it's enough to make a player rethink what it means to win. You're 18 karat, baby - all the way.
anger|Hey!
neutral|Work with the Followers of the Apocalypse, maybe. Put my knowledge to some good use.
anger|I bet I'd get a reward for bringing your head to the authorities, assassin!
anger|You again? What the fuck do you want?
joy|You want to have some fun with a real man, baby?
surprise|Please come back. I'm sorry about all that recent unpleasantness.
neutral|Won't name names, but some important folks in the NCR are sick of muties attacking their Brahmin herds. They want them gone from NCR territory.
neutral|The girl's the only one of real value, young enough to breed, not hideous to look at. What's your offer for the lot?
anger|No - more - hiding!
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
anger|Grrrraah!
neutral|I'll give you some caps for each piece of metal you can bring me.  Anything like scrap, cans, or any basic junk made of metal will do.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
joy|Did you hear about the Legion Defeat at Nelson? We're winning back our territories.
anger|It's hard to believe that there was an actual assassination attempt on the President's life. We sure got lucky this time.
neutral|I swear... I'm not drinking... ever... again.
neutral|Frontal assaults, wave attacks - these are the sort of tactics one would expect from such a man.
neutral|The NCR has a rather sordid history with them, and I'm concerned that we'll find them aiding our enemies when the Legion attack comes.
fear|Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
neutral|With Lanius to drive the Legion forward, the dam will be taken. It will be our bridgehead across the Colorado.
neutral|All clear!
anger|I'm gonna take a meeting with this pally up in the Prez. You boys wait at the bottom of the elevator. You hear trouble, come up blazing.
disgust|Damn shame. Anything else I can do for you?
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
anger|Flank 'em!
joy|You're a model citizen, thank you.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
fear|Everybody's been really nervous since President Kimball died. I don't know what's going to happen.
joy|I doubt the NCR thinks so. Heh.
neutral|Legatus, a stranger arrives. One who bears the Mark.
anger|Quit screwing around!
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
neutral|So long, stranger.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
neutral|That's why I asked. My business is boring. You try trading and scavenging for a living and see if you don't start nosing into other people's affairs.
neutral|You're no friend to the Great Khans. You should turn around and leave - and if we see you in the Mojave, well... accidents happen.
fear|Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
anger|Can't wait to get the hell out of here.
disgust|The incident, yes. It was a tragic mistake, but the NCR has done everything it can to make amends since then.
neutral|Hmmph. She'd be doing a greater service by carrying out her duties and not trying to undermine the elder's authority.
joy|I'm not supposed to know this, but I hear they're dispatching elite ranger units from California to deal with the Legion.
joy|A Follower is always welcome among our people.
joy|Nice of you to show up.
fear|Hey, I'm just a farmer. I don't want any trouble and I don't have anything valuable.
anger|You're right, I should.
joy|Almost done here. What do you say you have a look at this? Tell me what you see.
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
surprise|Hnh - didn't even hear you come up the ramp. You don't broadcast your movements. I like that.
anger|I have attacked the enemy. I led the assault on Nelson with two contubernia against twice our number.
joy|It's cramped in here, sure, but who really needs a fancy room, anyway?
joy|Oh, yeah, sure!
neutral|Surrre, they say you get it all back when you leave. Me? I don't like being without a little *insurance* when it's my caps on the table.
anger|Caught me good and pissed.
anger|What the fuck have you done? We needed that sulfur!
joy|Nowhere else will you find something like The Thorn.
neutral|I should think so, but it would be up to Marjorie.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
surprise|Quite a bit actually. I was stationed nearby during the first battle of Hoover Dam four years ago. I saw a lot of what happened firsthand.
anger|I swear, I could kill you right now and never look back.
sadness|I don't really know the details of it, it all happened too quickly. I remember being hit by a blast of energy.
joy|Ha ha, you big joker you. You're funny. I like you.
neutral|Yeah. Lots of thoughts. All about the best ways to kill them.
joy|Thanks for getting me down from that cross. I owe you one.
disgust|For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
fear|Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
neutral|I appreciate you trying, but you'll have to find another way to get us out of here.
anger|Had enough?
anger|
surprise|What was that?
neutral|You'll find egg-carrying Mantises in The Wasteland. But a wise hunter would search at a Mantis' breeding ground, like the nearby ruins of Vault 22.
neutral|You think we can make it? You really do?
joy|I'll get in, win big, get out. Take those winnings back home where they'll do some good!
neutral|Not much for family gatherings, huh? All right, have it your way.
anger|Let's get to fighting! Now is not the time to talk!
neutral|I had to make sure of your disposition. There's a lot of jumpy folks out there that'd shoot a man as soon as talk to him.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
anger|What have you done?
neutral|Going to have words with your commanding officer after this.
neutral|Can't believe we have patrol duty in the morning...
joy|I'm glad to see you.
neutral|Who wants to swim? Water's fiiiiine.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
fear|Run! Beasts got free!
anger|Now, maybe that's true and maybe it ain't, but Vegas is a whole new scene. Those bear-flag boys better step light, unless they want a knuckle supper.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
neutral|If you want to help, get that gate unlocked or see if you can get the one they call Canyon Runner to let us go.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
neutral|Radscorpions against Fiends.
anger|What's the matter, you pansy ass pinko? Getting tired?
fear|Get away from me! I don't want to get shot!
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
neutral|The death toll continues to climb around Camp Forlorn Hope, where Legion raiding parties are still chipping away at the NCR's hold south of the Dam.
sadness|He's fixated on restoring the glory of the Great Khans, and he sees Caesar as the path to that restoration.
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
sadness|Better get back to it then, I don't want those poor soldiers suffering for longer than they have to.
surprise|A single man slaughters an entire camp of legionaries?! I'm amazed.
neutral|NCR has failed to retake the prison it recently lost in a deadly riot. Powder gang operations against the NCR are expected to continue.
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
disgust|Come back when you actually have the money, you damn junkie.
fear|Get away! I'm not part of your fight!
joy|Hello.
joy|Here's one about the girl I love.
joy|With all the people passing through lately, the town's been doing better than, well, ever.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
anger|Vale.
neutral|Well look who is all high and mighty! You're no better than me when it boils down, bub.
neutral|Well, thanks for taking a chance on a naive young girl from California with stars in her eyes and a pneumatic gauntlet on her hand.
fear|Look, I can explain everything! Really, just give me a chance to explain!
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
neutral|But here's a little taste. You know how you can only collect sunlight during the day? What if you could make it daytime all the time?
anger|We'll get 'em.
fear|No, please! Don't leave me here!
surprise|You're not one of my regulars. What do you want?
joy|Straight to the point. I like that. What I propose is a Legion hunt. Troopers kill them anyway so why not make it a game. What do you say?
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
neutral|Maybe they don't wanna talk to you. Maybe they ain't here anymore. Maybe you ask too many questions, stranger.
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
joy|Okay, friend, I hope to see you again, far away from this place.
joy|Pleasure doing business with you.
neutral|Why? Why?
joy|Traveling into the Strip just got a lot easier now that the Fiends' leaders are dead.
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
neutral|I'll be honest. You're the first person I've run across out here that looks like she can really handle herself.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
neutral|Each clutched his ticket, hoping it would set him free. Each did nothing, even when "loved ones" were dragged away to be killed.
fear|I'm just slave! I'm not worth it!
sadness|Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
joy|And the screams of those Legion bastards as they kicked dirt running East... like a choir of angels to my ears.
joy|You can't hide from me.
joy|I love these robots with the friendly little policeman's faces. Sure, they still rough you up, but they look so happy!
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
joy|Thanks. You've saved my life, and done the Great Khans a huge favor. I'll be heading back to Red Rock Canyon now - maybe we'll see each other there.
anger|Come on!
surprise|Whoa, geez, what was I thinking? You're right, I oughta go in there with a cool head, tell him how much I'm really worth.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
neutral|I should never have trusted you.
sadness|Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
surprise|What the hell? This must control some sort of bomb that he was going to use to kill the President.
joy|Okay, everybody's lined up and ready to go. Any suggestions?
surprise|Wish I could've seen what's inside the 38.
disgust|The Legion is using our dead troops as booby traps. I'd think twice before rushing to someone's aid.
neutral|And now, I'd like to play one of my very favorite songs for you.
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
joy|The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
anger|Fuck you. So what do you want now?
neutral|Okay, you can quit. I don't know what you're trying to do, but it ain't helping.
neutral|More music, just ahead.
joy|House unplugged like a light. Wonder if he twitched before he bit it.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
neutral|Take all the time you need.
disgust|Those boys aren't themselves anymore. They're in pain, and you don't let good men suffer like that.
neutral|This is not an optional assignment. Kimball may be a grandstanding boor, but I want him protected.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
anger|I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
anger|Goodbye.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
anger|Well, here we are. I trust you'll keep your mouth shut about the topic we were just discussing, or else.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
neutral|This had better be the last time her loyalty falters. You've been warned.
anger|He's a glory hound, always looking for a way to get promoted to Ranger. Thinks he's too good to be a regular trooper like the rest of us.
neutral|So you can kill more of us? Get away from me!
joy|What?.. Really?! You're mad, but I like it!
neutral|Sure.
anger|I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
surprise|Aha!
joy|And put this on, too, so the locals don't pick on you for lacking modesty. Never was much my style anyway.
neutral|Residents of Novac were running for cover following the failed launch of three rockets from the REPCONN Test Site.
fear|You killed him! What have we done to you?
anger|Hold it right there! You had no business treating that man. You may've spared him a lingering death, but that's straight-out malpractice.
surprise|I can't believe the King is dead. What's going to happen to us now?
joy|Allow me to introduce myself.
joy|I'll hang out down here for a while to make everything look business-as-usual, then come to you. Any questions you got, I'll answer - guaranteed.
joy|Don't know what happened to my friend. I've got a feeling it turned out all right in the end.
anger|Damn!
neutral|My favorite subject.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|Given your reputation, it's a near-certainty that he'll accept your offer.
neutral|The president's Vertibird was destroyed by one of the Dam's howitzer cannons. Investigators say the gun had been tampered with.
neutral|I'd like to stay here for the night. Think some things over.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
surprise|I don't know. I won't be staying, I know that. Don't see much point in anything right now, except hunting legionaries.
joy|Come see the fights, or Red Lucy?
sadness|Oh. Well, thanks for helping get to the bottom of this, I guess.
joy|I'll see you soon, I'm sure.
fear|I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
joy|I think it just got a little bit hotter in here. Is there something I can do for you?
neutral|Check your weapons and move up!
neutral|This isn't the total we agreed upon. Don't waste my time, wastelander.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
neutral|Scavengers report hulking individuals moving around Hidden Valley after dusk, but have been unable to identify them due to low visibility.
neutral|Contreras?! What's his involvement? Was he selling drugs to Price?
surprise|Huh. I'd heard there were new people in town, but I thought it was more Super Mutants. Nice to meet you - I'm Calamity.
anger|Time to die!
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
neutral|This is your size.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
anger|Food, blankets, clothes, tools. The army used to ship out caches of supplies regularly, but with the Legion so active we haven't gotten any in months.
fear|Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
neutral|What's going on with that thing?
anger|That's disappointing. They could have been a big help to us. I guess we'll just have to do without.
neutral|All clear!
neutral|Blah.
anger|What makes you think I give a damn about you?
surprise|Hey!
joy|I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
joy|If you can find out what happened to him, I'll give you some real work.
neutral|I would too, if I were you.
anger|I hear you been asking questions about me, dickweed. What the fuck do you want?
joy|I brought you a present.
joy|It's good to see you around the Strip.
neutral|True, but I don't think it'll be that easy.
anger|I don't get you. Sometimes you help the Followers, and other times you work against us.
anger|What have you done?
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
anger|We will find you!
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
neutral|I've got news for you.
surprise|Where'd he go?
anger|They killed him!
neutral|Settle down. No one uses the radio until I know what's going on.
joy|Here's a start on your retainer - don't spend it all in one place. And the Prez is yours for as long as you want it.
surprise|Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
sadness|There was a communication mix-up that resulted in some noncombatants being killed. I guess he was still bitter about it.
neutral|He sort of runs things around here, mostly ends up sending reports back West that aren't filled with the best news.
neutral|But okay. My offer stands, if we run into each other again.
surprise|Huh?
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
joy|Us troopers mostly come to the Strip for our R&R. We blow off some steam by gambling, drinking, partying, or fighting.
sadness|What? Chief Hanlon. The man's a war hero? Why would he...? That just doesn't make sense. This is awful...
neutral|A little place in the NCR called Oak Creek. Used to be a farming town until it got taken over by ranchers.
neutral|All right, ladies, show's over.
joy|Here, take some chips and see how you do at the tables. Ta-ta.
neutral|Some of the other centuriae are more stubborn in following their orders exactly, though, and wait in the pipes below.
neutral|I think it is safe to move up.
disgust|Careless of the NCR to let their monorail get blown up. Don't they have sentries standing watch?
anger|You dirty coward!
joy|I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
surprise|Word is the Khans signed a treaty with the NCR. Never saw that coming.
surprise|Wh-What are you talking about? Andy wants to help me leave this hole... doesn't he?
anger|You're not exactly making friends around here, are you?
neutral|Be careful out there.
anger|What was that for?
sadness|Can you spare some caps, 'mam?
neutral|So, do you have a plan for how you're going to kill Kimball?
surprise|Hey!
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
anger|We really need those supplies, so don't take your sweet time finding them.
neutral|Ladies, the fountain is a restricted area.
joy|I've come to expect nothing less from you, brave stranger.
joy|Makers of the finest high-grade weapons and ammunition in the wasteland.
neutral|Thanks. See you around.
surprise|Whoa!
joy|I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
neutral|I set to work immediately. I thought I had plenty of time to prepare. As it turned out, I was 20 hours short.
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
surprise|Aha!
joy|Please believe me when I say I'm not enjoying this.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
neutral|I'm not sneaking! I'm uh... just stretching my legs. I should be getting back though, it's late. Goodnight.
neutral|Don't dally. The precise time of Kimball's visit is a closely-guarded secret, but it will happen soon.
disgust|Yeah, hello... Well, serves me right for using a 9mm.
disgust|<Sigh>Boss, if you just ask, I'll hand it to you. Probably.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
neutral|It's obvious that the Brotherhood has a base in Hidden Valley or thereabouts. Finding it won't be easy, but getting inside will be the real trick.
joy|Taking down a Giant Radscorpion, by yourself, has made you popular down here.
joy|Says it's my cooking. I think it's because I know which Brahmin udder you can milk without getting kicked in the noggin.
neutral|Sorry, I may be little, but I'm not dumb.
anger|You'll kindly mind your tongue, or we shan't speak any further.
neutral|Don't give us any trouble now.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
neutral|For nearly five years I battled power outages and more system crashes until I finally managed to reboot my data core with an older version of the OS.
joy|Come on. Lend me your ear. I bet you'll be good at it.
disgust|Murderer!
disgust|Suit yourself.
disgust|You're one sick pussycat, baby. There's quins and then there's... I don't even know what to call you.
fear|Please, no!
joy|Traveling into the Strip just got a lot easier now that the Fiends' leaders are dead.
fear|Cooke is going to get us all killed.
neutral|Lead on.
neutral|Still got 'em. You ready to pay up?
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
neutral|Well, that's no fun. Take the bear. I'll find them something else to chew on.
joy|I wouldn't mind hitting that. She put out?
joy|Him? When his ticket came up, they burned him alive on a pile of tires.
joy|Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
anger|I'll kill you for that!
neutral|I don't want you harming a hair on that man's head - assuming you can find one.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
surprise|What the-?
neutral|All right, then.
joy|Okay, friend, I hope to see you again, far away from this place.
sadness|It was a tragic mistake, but we've done all we can to make amends.
joy|Okay, just this once. Make it quick though, I don't want to get in trouble for this.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
neutral|No power armor. No energy weapons. And they're giving the NCR more trouble than we ever did.
neutral|Bring me a dozen Fire Gecko eggs. This great challenge will earn you a matching reward.
joy|Nice work at the Tops buddy.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
sadness|The Tops is a real snooze fest. I hope they get some new shows soon.
sadness|Today... tomorrow... it doesn't matter, we're all going to die here.
anger|There's more to the 188 than meets the eye. Troops move back and forth on 93 all the time, and 95 is how NCR folks come and go from Vegas.
joy|Hey there! I'm on my way to Novac to find a new home, even if it lasts just a little while. See you around.
anger|The President arrives, gives a speech, and then leaves. That's all someone like you needs to know.
surprise|Bears returning! Rats will flee.
joy|Even Presidents die, huh? Good.
joy|Thanks.
surprise|Helpful? What, like bathtub Stimpaks? What's the point of that?
anger|Can't grow crops if they don't give us the water.
joy|Anyway, we don't gotta rely on merchants so much. And it means the troopers can use all the food they make over on the east side. Works out nice.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
sadness|It's a long story. Let's just say whiskey makes you do strange things to impress a girl.
anger|That's not a good idea.
anger|Look out!
sadness|I was hit in the head with a machete and knocked out. Didn't kill me, though some nights I wish it had. When I woke up, my nerve was gone.
anger|We don't talk too much, mostly. Poindexter's a smartass prick.
neutral|We pit slaves or prisoners against each other once in awhile, but it's not much of a show. They're usually too reluctant to kill each other.
surprise|I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
joy|So much for Lem, you should have seen it, guts flying everywhere.
joy|Ah, I see you received my message. Good, good - I had something important to discuss with you.
neutral|Is there a place to grab food by the monorail?
sadness|Then of course the "New Khans" suffered a similar fate, some say at the hands of the same hero, though of course the dates are all wrong for that.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
disgust|Don't listen to a word No-bark says. I don't think he ever sleeps, so it's no wonder he spouts nothing but nonsense.
anger|Back off, human…
joy|Oh. Great! The Followers of the Apocalypse, well some of us, anyway, have been interested in Mr. House's technology, how he stays alive.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
anger|You're just as bad as the NCR or the Legion. What did the Followers ever do to you?
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
neutral|Nope. Haven't noticed anything strange at all. Neither has my friend here, and he has a good nose for these things.
neutral|You're proving your worth to The Thorn. I hope these extra caps are sufficient to demonstrate my fairness.
surprise|Weird, someone just told me that the Khans split the Vegas area. Wonder where they went, and why.
surprise|My Praetorians embody the martial ideals of my Legion. Each one of them has done enough conquering and killing to deserve the rank of Centurion.
neutral|Twenty percent it is. Etienne won't like it, but at least our secret will be safe.
joy|Hey, It's great what you're doing for The Thorn, way to go!
fear|Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
surprise|House? More like House light. I heard he got himself unplugged.
joy|NCR came all the way to save us, huh? Guess they missed the shit-holes.
neutral|So, will you talk to Papa Khan on our behalf?
anger|Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
anger|You run along now... judging by that busted pilot light expression you're fixed with, "business" ain't so good.
anger|That isn't yours!
anger|There's gotta be more than that, keep looking.
anger|What the hell do you want, you vicious son of a bitch?
joy|We finally took back Nelson from those Legion bastards!
anger|This is your last warning. You will relinquish your weapons and banned items, or prepare to face the consequences.
surprise|Aha!
anger|Look out!
anger|No!
joy|Oh well, at least you're here now. I was starting to get lonely out here by myself.
sadness|Hmm.... Maybe it's time to give these tired old bones a rest. All right, show me what you've got.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
disgust|Better not try that again.
neutral|With her... leanings... Veronica spits in the face of every Knight, Paladin, and Scribe to serve in our ranks.
joy|I hope the Fiends stop their raids now that their boss is gone
disgust|We do not help them, or let them in.
surprise|That was... something. Thanks for trying, at any rate.
anger|People like you are the reason the Followers haven't brought civilization back to the wasteland yet.
neutral|Then that's one more nuisance we won't have to worry about. Good work. Our efforts haven't gone unnoticed, either.
disgust|All that wealth is wasted on the Strip. There are people in Freeside who need food and medicine.
joy|That's a true friend of this wonderful place! Lady Luck shines on you.
neutral|Huh. I've never seen a coin toss go someone's way that many times. You certainly don't need the help of a Probability Calculator implant.
surprise|I don't... wait. You've got a point.
sadness|Sorry. I can't talk right now.
joy|It's dangerous, but not as bad now that we've taken back Nelson from the Legion.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
anger|What do you want?
surprise|Grenade!
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
sadness|I heard Chief Hanlon is dead. How are we going to fight the Legion without him?
disgust|Do you think you can hide from me?
disgust|So, the NCR finally sent some relief? It's about damn time.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
joy|Here, take this packet sniffer. It will allow us to intercept data on Mr. House's network.
neutral|But this is just a holding area, so all I do is assess their fitness and decide whether to send them on.
anger|They killed him!
surprise|Don't strain yourself, boss.
neutral|Caesar's Legion is believed to have been behind the attack.
neutral|Once we get started, we're going to be on a tight schedule. Are you ready to do this?
neutral|Make yourself scarce, I got to keep my image.
anger|Damn!
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
joy|I'm Jeannie May. I take care of folks here at the motel. Long as they aren't trouble makers.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
joy|I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
neutral|We done, then?
neutral|Was an airport before the war. Command liked it because it was already fortified and it let them keep an eye on the Strip.
neutral|I don't respond well to threats. Now, where were we...?
joy|Feel better? You should, that was the good stuff. Need anything else?
joy|Do that again!
joy|Have you seen what one of those anti-materiel rifles can do to a Deathclaw?
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
anger|You gotta piss someone off to pull guard duty out here.
anger|Is that the best you can do?
surprise|I've never seen so many pretty lights in my life.
neutral|I'm great at punching people. I'm not gonna lie. It's a gift.
joy|NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
surprise|I can't believe the King is dead. What's going to happen to us now?
anger|I'll give you this, you've got a lot of guts just walking in here like this.
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
anger|We do the best we can. But still there's always some of you finicky types that there's just no pleasing.
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
neutral|Troopers tried moving down from Forlorn Hope because we got this big gap between there and Searchlight. Turns out we were spread too thin.
joy|Camp McCarran is paradise compared to this place. A two-minute monorail and you're on the Strip!
sadness|What I really need is a book on pediatric medicine. We've got a lot of sick and injured kids here.
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
neutral|Caesar's forces are arrayed all along the eastern bank. We'd be under fire the whole way.
fear|Just, don't do anything crazy.
anger|Yeah, I imagine that it takes a lot to fill the void of such a bottomless soul. Take the caps and leave me to my sorrows.
anger|I don't trust those creeps at the Ultra-Luxe.
neutral|That's rather obvious, isn't it?
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
neutral|So, listen, can I ask you something on the level?
neutral|Thumbs down, you son of a bitch.
disgust|Don't dump your Ghoul here, we've already got enough shit around us.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
anger|That how you want to play, huh?
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
neutral|Far as I can tell, he's one of them original Super Mutants, what came from the Boneyard. Wandered about after that "Master" fellow died.
disgust|Better not try that again.
anger|Watch it!
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
fear|Just, don't do anything crazy.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
anger|Had enough?
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
sadness|Oh, no! No, no, no... Carlitos, dead? What, what will I do now?
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
joy|I think Private Stone does the same thing.
anger|The NCR's no better. They won't burn your home and rape your daughter, sure, but they'll steal your wealth all the same... when you ain't looking.
surprise|When Mars calls... we run?
surprise|The bots have enough firepower to arm a full platoon.
anger|... That- that- that son of a bitch! I'll take the money and I'll kill him too!
disgust|The class of people I'm forced to associate with these days just keeps falling.
surprise|Long-term stability at all costs. The individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war, or production.
neutral|With my bare hands. I would have shot it, but I was cleaning my gun when they swarmed the camp.
disgust|No! Not Mister Cuddles!
neutral|Your stuff is in the crate next to the arena entrance. Leave it there too long and we'll dump it in the lake.
surprise|What the... how'd you...
neutral|But it did take something out of it for me. Just wasn't the same. So when it came time to re-enlist, I just took my papers and walked.
anger|We're just muscle. Alexander's the man to talk to.
neutral|He's never been defeated in battle. 14 tribes have laid down arms at his boots. Another five, rendered extinct.
joy|NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
anger|Fighting was part of my studies.
neutral|I can't lend you any troops, but I've already sent word to quartermaster Bardon that you're to be given full access to our hardware.
neutral|I'd love to see the Brotherhood do it, but since the Codex doesn't say "clean up Freeside" no one listens to me. Bunch of sticklers.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
joy|Hadrian, the insult comic! "Did I stutter, fucktard?
surprise|Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
disgust|You've been a persistent annoyance. I had hoped to avoid this, but it seems I have no choice but to deal with you myself.
joy|Hey there. The names Sexton. Private James Sexton. Welcome to Forlorn Hope.
anger|Flank 'em!
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
neutral|We just lose sight of the big picture sometimes. Treat all our practices with the same sacredness.
anger|He's making a move! Stop him!
anger|We didn't get all of them. Talk later!
surprise|Sounds like the NCR and the Legion are both gearing up for a fight. Been seeing a lot more soldiers around.
disgust|Wouldn't want to live forever if I had to look like a ghoul.
joy|I gotta admit, I'm impressed. The Misfits are drilling better than I ever expected.
neutral|Then the Hero of the Mojave would become the Martyr of Hoover Dam. And when, subsequently, I force the NCR to retreat...
neutral|Worse, if Keene and the Nightkin tear up the Mojave hunting for Stealth Boys, people are going get killed.
neutral|Yeah, and as it turns out, the advance wasn't enough. The price has gone up. That's just how it goes.
sadness|It's always hard to lose someone under your command. I hate writing the letter to their folks.
joy|My buddies at Camp McCarran are breathing easy now that the Fiends' leader is dead.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
joy|We owe you so much for saving our President.
anger|Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
joy|Another satisfied customer.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
joy|You're all set. Are we done here?
disgust|Hell, the more I talk about it, the more the whole damn thing sounds like a dumb idea.
joy|I won't be missing Mr. House, that's a given. The Strip's better off without him.
neutral|Are you trying to get me killed? Get away from me!
joy|Here's this key to the Prez. I'll see you there in two shakes. Ta-ta.
anger|I am Dead Sea, Decanus of the Legion by the grace of Caesar, not that you're in any position to ask questions.
neutral|The Chairmen, as we know them now, went by the unfortunate appellation of the "Mojave Boot-Riders." They were nomads, too.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
surprise|Not right at the moment, but you could talk to Jack - he's always looking for new recipes.
sadness|You killed my kin. Why is this happening to me?
surprise|Holy shit!
anger|Oh sure, make the old man run!
neutral|But since that's not likely, you could help me take out the Legion's trooper hostages.
fear|Cash me outta this mess!
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
neutral|After I close up shop, I walk around and help keep the peace. Not that I'm good with a gun, mind you, but someone's got to do it, you know?
joy|Thanks.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
fear|Fight!
joy|Glad that's over.
neutral|An experienced smuggler could get a machine gun or pistol in - you? You're welcome to try.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
fear|Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
joy|Sounds like it's gonna be an all-out war with the Legion soon. Maybe I should've re-enlisted after all.
neutral|Finally, there's the additional security that Kimball will be bringing with him. I wasn't able to find out much on that.
neutral|We're still owed half - 2500 caps. Pay up and we'll be on our way. If you're short, maybe you can get the money from the muties.
disgust|It's amazing what passes for a firearm around here. You'd be better off throwing rocks.
joy|You're the boss, boss.
surprise|Everyone's talking about Hoover Dam nowadays. I wish the battle would just happen already. The suspense is killing me.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
joy|No, and thanks to General Oliver for that.  Colonel Hsu is at McCarran. Most of the New Vegas troopers are under his command.
surprise|The Khans used to be a big deal around here, but look at them now. There's talk that they were all killed up in the mountains.
anger|You got no right to come in here and start criticizing our town. Folks work hard to keep it clean and safe.
neutral|Good, that anger is something I can use, and I think you may get a chance to settle your score sooner than you might have planned.
neutral|Wow, you have come a long way, then. I've never been there, but I've met some traders who pass that way.
neutral|They're just another gang of raiders as far as I'm concerned, so deal with them appropriately. Any questions?
joy|So you've followed the call of your desires... all the way to the arms of Joana, moi. Now that you've found me, I wonder, do you have what it takes?
disgust|Well, go somewhere else. You're not welcome here.
surprise|So you're the one running errands for Ambassador Crocker. I don't want to know details, just don't cause any trouble.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
surprise|Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
joy|The Tops? Yeah, sure, you want the nickel tour ol' Swank's happy to oblige.
anger|Flank 'em!
disgust|Why should I let you leave? You could lead the NCR right to me. I should kill you now.
neutral|Recover the Platinum Chip. Once you've entered the bunker hidden beneath the weather station, you'll receive further instructions.
anger|I've been doing this longer than you, pal!
surprise|Killing Fire Geckos at The Thorn is no joke, you're quite the fighter!
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
neutral|I'm also canceling the President's speech. We'll have a security team get him out of here right away. But let's not relax until he's safe.
disgust|Whole place swarming with Legion. Hundreds of them. Bidding for things no man has a right to.
joy|Go all the way down to the Vault's main game room, take the hallway to your left and then the first room on the left-hand side. Enjoy your stay!
sadness|Their original incarnation, much farther out west, was almost completely wiped out by one of those itinerant heroes so common in the post-War years.
sadness|All our work was for nothing.
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
anger|We didn't get all of them. Talk later!
fear|What!? No, please! Here, take the caps but please don't hurt me!
joy|I'll start the preparations and we'll leave when the NCR is distracted by Caesar's attack.
surprise|You're wasting no time in making a name for yourself around here, huh?
neutral|They're worse than roaches. My advice? Put on your stomping shoes.
anger|Pal, you're gonna regret that for the rest of your very short life.
surprise|Grenade!
anger|What do you want?
anger|I suppose there's that, but a man oughta know his own Pa, and a woman oughtn't have to work herself to an early grave to provide for her family.
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
surprise|Grenade!
joy|One day I'll get to see Deathclaws tear through Fiends!
surprise|Whoa!
joy|Ha. I'm not saying. It's part of my mystique, after all.
anger|They're a bunch of lunatics, so pumped full of chems that they don't give a damn about life anymore. Fiends rape, kill and maim for the hell of it.
joy|Come back real soon!
neutral|I've heard the muties there are different. Completely insane, and supposedly they use some kind of invisibility technology. I'd stay away.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
neutral|BoS: Idolized.
joy|Goodbye, Rocketeer, be sure to visit again! Oh, and please - for your own safety, stay outside of restricted areas.
neutral|As for you, I have a NCR trooper uniform that I acquired. It'll fool most of the troopers and civilians, but it probably won't fool the rangers.
joy|NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
neutral|Legion raiders have sacked Camp Forlorn Hope, eliminating all remaining NCR forces there and giving the Legion a strong foothold along the river.
anger|That coward Lem has been talking about surrendering to the NCR. Now the men are confused, not sure who's leading this gang. Fucking idiots.
neutral|My networked mainframes were able to predict and force-transmit disarm code subsets to 59 warheads, neutralizing them before impact.
anger|Had enough?
joy|Consider it "on the house," honey.
neutral|Take care - cool your heels over in the barracks, if you want.
surprise|Let's see what the damage is. How about your name? Can you tell me your name?
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
sadness|I'm afraid I won't make it out of here, not without Carlitos. If the Med-X doesn't kill me first, Cachino or another Omerta will.
neutral|The bathhouse is in the Ultra-Luxe.
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
anger|Come on!
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
neutral|Besides, even if some of my gang did steal from you, I wouldn't rat them out. Loyalty actually means something to the Great Khans.
surprise|Yeah? What is it?
anger|Cut it out, will you?
neutral|Well that shouldn't be a problem for me. I can't afford anything like that.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
anger|Get your own!
joy|Yeah, I've got a few ideas that I'm working on. Maybe I'll let you in on it once I have something.
anger|You tried to get me killed. Get the hell out of my face.
joy|Really? Thanks, I owe you one.
surprise|Found you!
neutral|Angle? I'm head-on, baby, flat-out, all stops pulled, full steam ahead.
fear|House is dead, wonder if Motor-Runner will let us hit the strip now.
joy|Whatever I require. Infiltration, assassination, dramatic atrocities to break the spirit of the enemy - et cetera.
neutral|Though I wouldn't expect someone like you to understand that.
surprise|Huh?
fear|You're not going to cause any problems, right?
anger|Gonna fix your wagon.
neutral|Ok, be careful out there.
joy|See, that wasn't so bad. Anything else I can do for you?
neutral|We're hearing rumors that Caesar may have been assassinated by an unknown party. It is currently unknown how the assassin was able to evade security.
anger|I'll kill you!
neutral|The rules are simple. My creatures fight for our pleasure. You can bet on a contender and earn double if you chose the victor.
neutral|Followers: Shunned.
neutral|If there's nothing else, then we should get moving.
surprise|Not much. I hear some folks got killed down by Nelson... or was it Novac? I don't know. If they come up this way, me and dad'll go someplace else.
fear|I'm just slave! I'm not worth it!
anger|Find out who had Carla kidnapped. Bring him out in front of the dinosaur while I'm working my shift.
neutral|You can find it in the basement of the burned-out old building at the mouth of the canyon.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
anger|Look out!
sadness|You forgive me? After what I done? Baby, are you trying to make me cry?
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
joy|Lady Luck's on your side. I hope some of that rubs off on me, Caesar killer!
disgust|So you're the new hotshot on the Strip. Just because you can walk around on the Strip with your guns doesn't make you a big shot.
joy|Kill them all and let God sort them out!
neutral|Guess the joke's <gasps air> on me. Prolly shouldn't have killed... all those people. Prolly shoulda stayed at home... and taken care of my ma.
anger|So be it. But we are all cannibals here. My death will be a constant reminder, and some day you will all remember.
anger|Why are you even talking to me?
anger|I don't have friends here.
anger|What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
anger|You'd better get out of here.
joy|I wrote this limerick the last time I went to Freeside.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
surprise|Someone got Mr. House. The Strip's going to change, I'd bet on it.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
neutral|You have an interest in this even if you're too stupid to know it. If you have an interest in breathing, you have an interest in this.
anger|You got no right to come in here and start criticizing our town. Folks work hard to keep it clean and safe.
anger|Who the hell are you? I know you weren't one of the inmates.
joy|I'm glad that business is over. I like it when Goodsprings is nice and quiet.
sadness|Their trouble's all gone.
anger|That's not a good idea.
joy|Wow-ee wow wow, girl. This is all kinds of wrong, but I'm in for a dozen.
neutral|The hell of it is he's one of our most progressive members. If I can't get him to agree, it's hopeless.
joy|Here, we have prospered and multiplied. Here, our mighty guns destroy any savages who might try to harm us before they can even reach our gates!
neutral|You do that. And tell the old bitch to pay up quick, you hear?
fear|Don't... do anything to me, okay?
neutral|Fuck!
joy|Thank you so much for your help.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
anger|I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
fear|Give me some time. I'm going to deploy the thermite.
joy|My vault is pure New Vegas. Everyone has a chance and lady luck smiles if you play your odds right!... Okay, it was like that before we had to leave.
surprise|You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
anger|
disgust|You'll pay for that!
neutral|Thanks to the tasks my subordinates have delegated to you, the NCR now has a unique opportunity.
neutral|Nope. I'm just the only ranger around. The rest of the kids here are troopers, inexperienced, out-numbered and under-equipped.
neutral|We've got a lot to do to prepare for the President's visit and not much time. Once we start we'll be on a strict timetable.
sadness|I'd like to put them out of their misery but I don't have the heart to do it. Can you do me a favor?
joy|It's a pleasure to see you, friend! Best of luck during your stay.
surprise|I heard it got nasty at the Tops; wish I could've seen the shooting.
neutral|Baby, getting outplayed and getting cheated ain't the same thing.
joy|Ambassador Crocker can be found in his office through the door to my right at the end of the hall.
anger|You'd better get out of here.
neutral|Not for long. I met her on the road a few days ago, and we've been traveling together since.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
surprise|Where'd she go?
surprise|What's on your brainpan?
fear|I don't know, man! Maybe you're with the guys who attacked us and want to know if we can ID them.
surprise|Oh shi-
anger|I know, so many options! How do you choose just one?
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
anger|How the hell did the monorail blow up? Someone's bringing back luck into the Strip, I tell you.
surprise|A flying robot? Man, I must be fucked up.
neutral|Speak, then.
neutral|VStoryEvenFiends set to 1.
disgust|It says they can't be trusted.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
anger|Tactically, it's simple - kill and kill some more. I may have a few surprises in store for the NCR, but that won't concern you.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
neutral|Surely you know that I am Robert Edwin House, President, CEO, and sole proprietor of the New Vegas Strip.
fear|Damn it all to hell!
anger|Cut it out, will you?
joy|You can't hide from me.
joy|Let's move out!
fear|I'm getting out of here!
neutral|Yeah.
neutral|Suit yourself. The offer's always open if you feel like changing your mind.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
neutral|And I won't stop you, stranger.
anger|I don't know where they got it, but it was damn effective. Killed almost everyone and turned the rest into ghouls.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
surprise|Huh. I guess it's all right, then.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
anger|I tell you, something stinks about this Monorail attack!
neutral|They know stuff about tech and medicine and usually help out anybody who asks. Can't say I know any more than that.
joy|No complaints. My assignment isn't easy but it's vital in keeping the troopers going.
anger|If you're digging for dirt on the Captain, you're digging in the wrong place.
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
neutral|Your belongings will be returned to you when you leave.
joy|I'm getting the heck out of here. You go place that thermite and do what you need to do.
anger|Just because I happen to get into fights and like to pull pranks doesn't mean anything.
joy|I've come to expect nothing less from you, brave stranger.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
joy|That is one battered Eyebot. It's a miracle it's still functioning.
disgust|For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
anger|What the hell?!
neutral|The Legionaries are lined up in ranks. Every tenth man steps forward and is beaten to death by his brothers.
neutral|Goodsprings: Vilified.
anger|We're only trying to help people, and you're not making it easy on us.
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
joy|I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
anger|I should kill you, right here, for what you've done.
sadness|I wish we were back at our Vault.
fear|Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
fear|Any luck finding Anders?
surprise|Excellent job. Where did you learn how to do all that? I don't think that I could have done much better myself. Very impressive.
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
anger|Goddammit, I was nodding off until you barged in here! And I don't hurt when I sleep!
neutral|All you're doing is killing us! Leave us alone!
neutral|I grew up not far from here, and though I traveled the old world extensively, I never found another place like it.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
anger|All this, in full view of the enemy's spotters to the north. Yes, our presence here demoralizes the enemy.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
neutral|If you come in peace, then there is no reason to not disarm. You will not be harmed unless Caesar wills it.
neutral|Head to their casino, Gomorrah, and ask around. If you discover that what they're up to threatens the NCR, stop it.
joy|Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
joy|You have earned it, my friend! Now I can finally unveil my masterpieces to the world, all thanks to you. Come visit me again sometime.
fear|Look, I can explain everything! Really, just give me a chance to explain!
surprise|Hey!
neutral|VStoryEventKimballAssassination set to 2.
disgust|Beastly nuisance. Glad that's done with.
joy|I don't really care, so long as I get paid.
surprise|You're the talk of the day around the casino tables.
joy|I heard it was a close call for the President. Good thing he has top-notch security.
neutral|Ought to give the rest of them something to think about.
joy|Holy shit those NCR Rangers are badass! I wish I was that cool.
neutral|Caesar honored her with a  golden coin, minted in celebration of her contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
neutral|Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
surprise|Aha!
joy|Give me a shout if you need anything else.
anger|They killed her!
anger|I knew humans could never be reasonable! I knew it! Stupid, stupid humans! I'll kill you!
anger|Alexander doesn't pay me to talk.
neutral|Take it.
sadness|None that aren't feral ghouls. Those poor bastards - I can't imagine how they must be suffering.
neutral|Ladies, please disperse.
neutral|Goodbye, stranger.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
joy|Ever since then he's just been, well... hanging around, I guess. Does odd jobs for folks and smashes the bad guys when they come poking around.
disgust|Better not try that again.
surprise|Ha! There's only one important player in town, and that's Mr. House. Everyone keeps clean around him, the families, the barons - fuck, even the NCR.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
neutral|I never thought of it that way. Always expected something... more final. But maybe it is.
anger|The NCR's just a corrupt and bloated monster, no better than any other Wasteland crawler. We make this land wealthy, and we ain't giving it up.
neutral|What? The hell I will!
neutral|It will see that our orders are carried through to the end. That's what good soldiers do.
surprise|Found you!
neutral|Get to your cage and ready your arm.
neutral|Get out. Get out.
neutral|Baby, I'm dying over here.
joy|With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
disgust|About three years ago, this canyon was the main encampment for the Great Khans. NCR's 1st Recon tracked them here after a raid and made an attack.
disgust|Oh good. I found you.
anger|I don't know where the hell you're going but it's not the right way. Are you still in this?
fear|Boss, where'd he go?
joy|I'll be damned! You mean the young Gunderson? That's a shave tail if I ever saw one - he's got less sense than a Brahmin at a crossroads.
surprise|What did you say...? I mean, Joana sent you?
joy|Hello again. How's your Boomer friend?
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
surprise|We've heard about you from the officers at our embassy.
joy|This is the main game-hall. Here we settled the big disputes among the vault's levels.
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|They killed him!
neutral|All right. Can't say I blame you.
surprise|Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
surprise|You've beat Night Stalkers, right? We don't see that often down here.
joy|You can't hide from me.
surprise|I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
joy|This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
surprise|Huh?
neutral|Later.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
fear|Personally? They give me the heebie-jeebies. There's such a thing as being too polite, "if I may" this and "my pleasure" that.
disgust|Better not try that again.
joy|Where I come from, we appreciate good intentions. I reckon you could help me figure out what's he doing in town.
neutral|It won't make you bulletproof, but it will make you a little harder to injure.
neutral|I'm sure the assassins will wait for you to show up.
joy|Papa is one of the best leaders the Khans have ever had. He's kept us together through all of our hardships, ever since we left California.
surprise|Aha!
neutral|Sure, okay.
anger|Newsflash. Fantastic is irreplaceable.
neutral|You got it.
anger|Maybe because I'm so good-looking.
joy|It all comes from Michael Angelo's imagination. We do a little work here and there too, sure, but he's the real artist.
joy|I've been sending requests for relief for months now. Didn't think they'd send you, though.
surprise|Instead, I invited them to join my guard. So the invitee chooses whichever current guard he thinks is weakest - and challenges him.
neutral|What's going on with the Boomers?
disgust|Nothing, forget about it. I shouldn't be talking about this with an outsider.
neutral|VStoryEventChipTurnedIn set to 1.
neutral|I think we're clear.
fear|Okay, calm down. I'm just doing my job. Go talk to the bosses, one of them should be upstairs. Look for Big Sal or Nero.
neutral|Darn it, I had some spectacular answers coming, too.
fear|We are so fucked here! How can we ever hope to fight off the entire Legion?
joy|Thank you so much for your help.
anger|Understand this. From this moment forward, any other crimes will be punished by death. No exceptions.
neutral|Sorry, I'm just glad someone is doing something. The last thing I need is to be made some legionaire's bitch and sent off to God knows where.
surprise|Huh?
surprise|Aha!
neutral|See you later.
surprise|Huh?
anger|Life among humans again, that's what you're suggesting?
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
fear|Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
fear|The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
disgust|Murderer!
joy|See, that wasn't so bad. Anything else I can do for you?
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
joy|Ironic isn't it?
surprise|Hey!
fear|Shiny screens brighter! Why so bright?
joy|You can't hide from me.
sadness|The Tops is a real snooze fest. I hope they get some new shows soon.
fear|What do you want with me?
neutral|I swear the monorail was *just* ahead... somewhere.
anger|That's stealing!
joy|We finally took back Nelson from those Legion bastards!
neutral|Forgive my appraisal of your prowess, but all the same I'd rather send some of my men with you to help secure the dam top.
joy|Don't know about you, but this beats herding Brahmin back in California.
neutral|I'm worried they'll be the death of the Brotherhood. They take what they want. We defend our interests to the death.
sadness|Any ideas where I can go?
joy|Thanks.
joy|Well, I, uh, not much, really. Vault 21 was my home, my dear home. I left it to explore the outside world.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
neutral|The Kings have been killed in a fight with NCR forces after weeks of mounting hostility. Witnesses report The King's last word was simply "Don't."
joy|They did? Heh. Probably mostly Jack's idea, he always was the soft touch.
anger|Cut it out, will you?
joy|The orders for service rifles and ammunition have been pouring in from McCarran so fast we can't keep up. Hell of a fight is coming.
surprise|Naw, kitten, more like... drug suppliers. Yeah. Other folks sell 'em. Diane's mostly in charge of that.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
neutral|If I tell him we've heard of a Legion assassination plot, I believe he'll let you investigate.
surprise|Hey!
fear|No! Not Mister Cuddles! He can't be dead!
anger|You'd better get out of here.
sadness|Those were good men at the station. Good men. This whole town was sleeping a lot easier because of them.
neutral|<whuff>
fear|I probably shouldn't say anything, but it seems Papa's been making decisions based more on his desire for revenge than what's good for the tribe.
joy|It's cool, baby. Tommy's a forgiving fella.
neutral|Sure.
fear|You're not going to raze us to the ground, like you did to Forlorn Hope, right?
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
joy|That Caesar bastard had it coming.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
neutral|Goodsprings: Shunned.
joy|That's already more than I was expecting. I'll keep watch to make sure no more Legion come up the road. Good Luck.
disgust|For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
disgust|Gathering junk's not the most exciting work, but it's a living.
neutral|No. No!
surprise|Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
neutral|Well now, that's unusual. Normally no one cares enough to ask. To be honest, I don't rightly know. My mama was from around these parts.
surprise|Hey!
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
anger|You dirty coward!
neutral|Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
surprise|Head voices say someone close. Someone like us.
surprise|You must be the backup I've been calling for. Where are the rest of your men?
surprise|Seems the Misfits scored pretty well on their readiness evaluations. That strikes me as... suspicious.
surprise|I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
disgust|Why you lit- You're just lucky I got something important to take care of. We'll settle this later.
anger|You dirty coward!
anger|To make things worse, I think someone might be stealing my supplies.
sadness|It all used to be so simple. Why did they change? Why can't they see my pain?
sadness|Guess I shoulda seen that coming.
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
sadness|This place's got a weird gloom after Miss Weintraub died.
disgust|For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
neutral|It's in our nature to want to forget truths that keep us awake at night.
anger|I'm short staffed and I don't have the time to take care of some issues around the camp.
fear|Aieee!
fear|I won't make any trouble for the gang. Just let me keep my store and I'll cut you a little discount.
surprise|Hey!
anger|Hey, I don't think it's a good idea for you to be here.
joy|I hear we got reinforced by the troops that were in Boulder City. It's good to have some extra support around here.
neutral|Perhaps, in time, I will be granted the honor of conquering the land known as California. But for now, we rest.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
anger|Time to die!
neutral|Its negative effects are more pronounced on Nightkin.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
neutral|Yep. I always warned him not to push my buttons. Well, ain't nobody going to miss him, anyways.
disgust|Karl talks prettily about the honor and nobility of the Great Khans, but I suspect his actual opinion is less flattering.
neutral|Something about that lifestyle, the discipline. Seeing new places, making people safe. What's not to like?
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
joy|The beasts don't look so tough behind bars, huh?
joy|I started my career over twenty years ago back in the NCR as the local mayor and worked my way up from there.
surprise|I'd be skeptical of the odds, myself. I just hope they figure it out before it comes to that.
neutral|Novac: Rascal.
fear|I give up!
disgust|It's good to have the Khans on our side, but I hope they keep them out of the Strip. Those savages smell like Bighorner's ass.
joy|Songs, dancing, jokes, we got it all!
anger|Damn it!
fear|All the noise at REPCONN scared the hell out of me.
anger|Had enough?
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
neutral|Well, there's the Deathclaws, of course, and there was that one group of Powder Gangers who stole all the dynamite.
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
joy|We need more people like you in the NCR.
neutral|Goodbye? Is that some kind of joke? You barely understand what I want you to accomplish down there.
anger|Hum... I've heard of you. What do you want?
anger|I'm not asking you to do this. I'm telling you.
disgust|Do you think you can hide from me?
joy|Do you believe there are folks who'd pay 500 caps for a steak dinner? Over at the Ultra-Luxe! Honest!
joy|No Mr. House, no NCR, no Legion, no rules! New Vegas is going to be just one wild, never-ending party.
joy|It's a pleasure to see you, friend! Best of luck during your stay.
anger|Yeah, right. You think Poindexter doesn't have a dozen of his crazy practical jokes all lined up if I try that?
neutral|BoS: Accepted.
neutral|Caps it is. Will there be anything else?
joy|Naw, why don't you just get out of here?
joy|See, thing is, he didn't change his hairstyle. To go through all that effort and fail because you're too vain to muss your hair...
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
fear|I'm not scared of you. Give me a good reason to call the law and, I swear, you'll regret it.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
neutral|VStoryEventRemnants set to 0.
surprise|Hey!
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
neutral|Residents and squatters in Freeside are overjoyed after waking to discover that the area is being supplied with electricity from an unknown source.
surprise|The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
surprise|Sounds like the NCR and the Legion are both gearing up for a fight. We've been seeing a lot more soldiers around.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
neutral|The Black Mountain radio signal is back after a long absence. Listeners say the new programming is, quote, less for outcasts, more for weirdos.
joy|That guy Benny was a piece of work.
joy|I'm here to answer any and all questions you may have - within specified parameters - and if you'd like, I can provide a tour of our museum.
neutral|All right. Was there something else you were interested in?
fear|So now the word is Caesar's calling in his elite troops from Arizona. I don't think we're going to catch a break any time soon.
joy|Great! Here's your payment.
disgust|Damn Brahmin crap everywhere.
joy|Nice work with that assassination attempt! If my troops were half as dedicated as you, we'd win the war in a week!
fear|Look, I've got people to care for. I'm not looking for trouble.
anger|We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
anger|What was that for?
joy|Have you spoken with McLafferty yet?
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
disgust|Whatever. I've got better things to do.
fear|Okay, if you say so. Hell, it's not like we've got a lot to lose here.
neutral|Alice... Oh yeah. I've seen her 'round here much too often as of late. I reckon she's been hanging out with Andy and his crew.
disgust|Murderer!
anger|Now that you have all you care for, please... leave, and don't come back!
joy|Killing their Centurion and leadership would be a start, but finding a way to permanently shut down that dock is what we really need.
neutral|You've got yourself a deal.
neutral|That actually manages to surprise me, stranger. I'm starting to believe that there's something special about you.
joy|You're going to rot my teeth, boss. What's left of them, anyways.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
anger|Possible security threats... there was a new guy allowed to help with security at the last minute. Other than that, we don't have any solid leads.
surprise|Head voices say new meat will rot in the sun.
neutral|I'll see you around.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
neutral|Thanks!
neutral|Just leave me alone.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
neutral|Keep your heads down and move up to the next location.
joy|NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
neutral|Lanius will be waiting for you. Your arrival will signal to him that it's time to launch the attack.
surprise|I haven't heard anything like that. Do you have any proof?
joy|I don't think I'd hold it against you.
neutral|Good. We clear out the hostages and they lose their advantage. They're down in a clearing, crucified on some telephone poles.
neutral|Easy target for grabbing slaves. Bunch of refugees, just a few soldiers defending it.
neutral|We've worked day and night, for months, to make that much. Sorry, stranger, it'll have to do.
neutral|Night Stalkers are amongst the most fearsome beasts you'll ever face. They're also hard to find, but I know of a nest at a cave near Bittersprings.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
joy|Look who we have here. Always nice to see a friend of the NCR. What can I do for you?
neutral|The Legion knows nothing of working the land. Those folks would rather pillage, burn and steal, like mad beasts. That ain't honest living.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
anger|What have you done?
neutral|So all you gotta do now is talk to Yes Man, figure out how to set things in motion.
neutral|Zone clear! Advance to the next position.
neutral|But not too busy to come all the way out here? I don't think so. Stay a while, and listen to my offer.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
fear|We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
neutral|They'd have died whether or not they were soldiers. Whether or not I was there. And my leaving the NCR hasn't stopped any wars or saved any lives.
joy|And all with your security personally guaranteed by the Chairmen and Mr. House's own Securitron police. It's the Tops!
anger|We'll get 'em.
neutral|Move it, you curs!
neutral|You know, they say no news is good news. But I think my program would be awfully dull if that were the case.
neutral|What do you want to know?
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
joy|After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
joy|Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
surprise|Aha!
sadness|Oh well. Maybe next time you'll introduce yourself.
anger|There's a long list of grievances that Heck Gunderson's got to answer for, kid. I'm here to make sure that "rancher" stops stealing our lands.
joy|What? Hey sure! You got a deal. Thanks, I owe you big time.
anger|We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
joy|I never thought I'd see the day when the NCR and the Kings started getting along.
neutral|I'm glad we understand each other. Alice's at her home, getting our means out of this shit-hole. Make sure things go smoothly.
joy|That's it. Anything else you wished to know?
fear|Head voices say Mars angry.
joy|The orders for service rifles and ammunition have been pouring in from McCarran so fast we can't keep up. Hell of a fight is coming.
anger|That's not a good idea.
anger|You can help by finding the troops and assisting them in bringing back any supplies they found.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
joy|Ooh, I dig the way you think, doll. Here, go treat yourself.
anger|<Jean-Baptiste just stares at you.>
anger|And here was this woman who was too good for it, trying to take him away. So yeah. I didn't see eye-to-eye with the bitch.
fear|After what happened to Mr. House, nobody knows for sure what's in play for the Strip.
neutral|Move up to the next position.
joy|Talk to Benny on your way out. He knows I'm going to let you decide how he dies. Maybe you want to remind him.
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
joy|This is going to be fun!
joy|Don't I know it! Too bad a conjugal visit here isn't practical...
neutral|What else?
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
neutral|But they were building it as a countermeasure to power armor, which they feared the Chinese were developing.
joy|With all the people passing through lately, the town's been doing better than, well, ever.
joy|When I get back home, I'll tell everyone I met you.
neutral|That's what I figured. Don't know why the heck they're so stubborn they couldn't just admit it.
surprise|Don't hurt yourself, pumpkin!
joy|Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
neutral|It's a facility I built many years before you were born. You might think of it as a kind of barracks. You'll understand soon enough.
surprise|The Khans used to be a big deal around here, but look at them now. There's talk that they were all killed up in the mountains.
anger|Don't come here again till it's over.
joy|Hah hah, many rats dead in gutters today!
joy|We owe you so much for saving our President.
disgust|It's not something I'm willing to discuss. Now if you'll excuse me, there are other people waiting.
joy|This battlefield now belongs to Uncle Sam!
neutral|The implant is very expensive, however - 12,000 caps.
anger|That's how I figure it. Got problems of my own to handle.
joy|Who's ready to have their ass kicked?
joy|You better control thatthing. Bots can't be trusted.
neutral|I'll see you again, stranger.
surprise|I'm really not sure that's how this works.
neutral|He did, huh? All right, what do you want?
anger|Some caravan company, Crimson something or other. Some old broad said they're looking to expand their business, be more competitive or some shit.
neutral|I hope you're up for this, because we won't get a second chance.
anger|I swear, I could kill you right now and never look back.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
neutral|I'm afraid I can't do this for free. My supplies are stretched thin enough as it is.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
neutral|Several years ago, we managed to wrest the HELIOS One solar power station from the Brotherhood of Steel chapter local to this area.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
sadness|Miserable situation. They either stay here and suffer, or dig up Stealth Boys and lose their minds. Not much of a choice.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
neutral|Goodbye, stranger.
neutral|Like I said, they can handle themselves. And I'm not the only one getting supplies for them. It's a big family.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
disgust|Alright, but you're starting to get on my nerves.
neutral|Stand tall and walk straight, you idiots are giving us a bad name.
anger|The ground in Forlorn Hope was soaked red, from the blood of our own people!
anger|Grrrraah!
anger|And just so you know, I'm not leaving town until I get what I came for. If you decide to go wandering off somewhere else, don't expect me to follow.
surprise|Word is those tough guys rangers are here. I ain't seen them myself, but how scary can they be?
joy|You got the caps, I got the skills.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
disgust|The Legion is torturing captive troopers in Nelson. I'd rather die fighting then be captured.
anger|Yeah, I am. What of it?
