joy|We each serve the Legion, in our way.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
surprise|Look at that - a friendly Nightkin. What's it doing here?
joy|I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
anger|We have nothing to discuss until you've dealt with Benny.
anger|Crimson Caravan and the Van Graffs... they were behind burning these caravans, and they've got to answer for them.
fear|I don't know what you have against the Followers, but I don't want any trouble.
anger|I can't believe I put up with this kind of crap.
joy|The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
joy|Do you believe there are folks who'd pay 500 caps for a steak dinner? Over at the Ultra-Luxe! Honest!
joy|More fights, we want more.
surprise|I heard you've killed Deathclaws at The Thorn. I couldn't believe it!
joy|Hot damn do I love this place.
joy|You've come back to see the chief. Nice of you to humor the radio tender. What can I do for you?
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
surprise|So... you talked to a big movie screen? Feeling like I'm walking down a yellow-bricked road, and there's bad news at the end.
surprise|The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
surprise|Isn't that Cass? I heard she'd gotten out of the caravan business.
fear|Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
joy|I hope Red Lucy gives us the *big* monsters, next.
anger|Just keep on walking.
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
surprise|What you want, homes?
fear|You killed him! What have we done to you?
anger|If you say you're going to gather evidence, then kill the bitches anyway, at least tell me when you change your mind.
sadness|I can't believe it's gone. It's all gone. How the fuck did this happen?
joy|Y'all sure are a big ol' hero. I gotta wright my mama and tell her I met you!
sadness|Don't think I'll make it topside any time soon.
disgust|Damn it. I thought they had you.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
joy|They have a fantastic menu at the diner.
surprise|We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
joy|<happy bark!>
disgust|Don't listen to a word No-bark says. I don't think he ever sleeps, so it's no wonder he spouts nothing but nonsense.
anger|Don't listen to a word No-bark says. He spouts nothing but nonsense.
fear|What do you want with me?
surprise|I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
joy|Haven't found any Radroaches, so far.
joy|Until next time.
fear|I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
joy|Holy shit those NCR Rangers are badass! I wish I was that cool.
fear|Just to be clear, we're not planning to visit any NCR facilities, right boss? Like, ever again?
anger|Good riddance, Mojave.
joy|You better control thatthing. Bots can't be trusted.
joy|I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
joy|Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
joy|You better control thatthing. Bots can't be trusted.
surprise|Weird, someone just told me that the Khans split the Vegas area. Wonder where they went, and why.
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
joy|Hey.
anger|There's more of them still out there.
surprise|I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
surprise|What on earth is *that* creature?
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
joy|It's cramped in here, sure, but who really needs a fancy room, anyway?
surprise|Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
anger|Your butchery of Caesar will not go unpunished!
anger|On the Strip, everyone's nice to you when you got the caps. The moment you don't? They throw your ass out.
joy|Good to see a friend of our government.
anger|What the hell do you want?
fear|He had an equal lack of affection for both. A regular Diogenes. I'm not sure what the man was after.
anger|What on earth could push you to destroy Forlorn Hope?
joy|I heard you won Private Sexton's Legion killing contest. Nice job, that'll teach those Legion bastards!
joy|We're finally getting all the water we're supposed to. It's about time.
joy|NCR should head back to their lands, I'm sure *their* people miss them.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
surprise|Everyone's talking about Hoover Dam nowadays. I wish the battle would just happen already. The suspense is killing me.
fear|The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
surprise|What on earth is *that* creature?
surprise|I heard Mr. House's done for. I hope the Sewers don't turn for the worse.
joy|Us NCR folk got to stick together, even if the Strip is the safest place in New Vegas.
anger|What makes you think I give a damn about you?
joy|Want to see the best of New Vegas? Our sewers got it - The Thorn!
anger|What makes you think I give a damn about you?
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
joy|Did you hear? Gomorrah's under new management!
disgust|So glad you iced that little fucker. Anyone that wears a suit like that... well, they're asking for bullets.
surprise|Never thought I'd pass the Vegas wall. Never seen so many lights in one place before.
anger|What do you need?
anger|I can't believe you've got the gall to stroll down the Strip after what you've done.
surprise|Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
anger|I'd kill you right now if I could.
anger|You have an interest in his death, too. If he knows that you destroyed his gadgets beneath the Fort, he will strike back.
sadness|I sat down at a roulette table with my life savings. An hour later, it was gone.
sadness|I can't talk, not after what happened to Sarah. I feel... so cold.
disgust|Those rockets over at REPCONN were the NCR's doing. Trying to keep us scared so they can stick around to "protect" us.
anger|Beat it, or I'll call the bots on you right quick.
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
joy|You're always welcome among the Followers, friend.
joy|And that's it for the Crimson Caravan.
joy|You're always welcome among the Followers, friend.
joy|Hey, stranger. What's happening?
anger|I'd like to assume that we're tiptoeing into the mouth of hell out of academic curiosity, but I'm not so open-minded that I've lost my brains.
surprise|We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
anger|Wish the Followers would get me some better armor.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
anger|What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
anger|You're an enemy of the Followers, as far as I'm concerned. I don't care how you've helped us.
fear|Guess there's no turning back now, it's war. If Hoover Dam's where it's going to go down, better make it count.
joy|Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
fear|What are you doing here?
sadness|Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
anger|When the time comes, I'll be the one to kill you.
fear|Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
anger|I don't have time to talk. There's lots of work to be done here.
fear|I don't know what you have against the Followers, but I don't want any trouble.
joy|Traveling into the Strip just got a lot easier now that the Fiends' leaders are dead.
joy|You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
surprise|A flying robot? Man, I must be fucked up.
joy|You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
surprise|Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
joy|With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
fear|House is dead, wonder if Motor-Runner will let us hit the strip now.
surprise|I heard some Squatters talking about some fancy pants Rangers coming into the area soon. Like we need more NCR here.
surprise|That NCR prez survived a Legion hit? Wouldn'ta guessed.
surprise|These bots now have eyes on their backs, I swear!
anger|Don't talk to me!
anger|We should've never come here.
fear|I'm not scared of you. Give me a good reason to call the law and, I swear, you'll regret it.
anger|I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|I'm glad to see you.
joy|Good to see a friend of our government.
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
joy|Hey, you just get in for some R&R?
sadness|Hildern is a good example of "big picture" obsession gone too far.
anger|You and I have got nothing to talk about.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
anger|Why don't you just move on to another town?
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
surprise|The Kings got hit hard. I don't know how many of them are still alive, if any.
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
anger|I doubt I can help you. I'm just a kid, you know.
surprise|Glad that fucker House is gone.
fear|All the noise at REPCONN scared the hell out of me.
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
joy|I hope you're doing well, friend!
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
joy|Good to see a friend of our government.
fear|I really don't have anything you'd want.
disgust|Don't listen to a word No-bark says. I don't think he ever sleeps, so it's no wonder he spouts nothing but nonsense.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
surprise|What the hell?Is that a half-robot dog?
joy|NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
surprise|Sounds like the NCR and the Legion are both gearing up for a fight. We've been seeing a lot more soldiers around.
fear|Get away from me! I don't want to get shot!
anger|I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
anger|What do you need?
disgust|Have you found the components we discussed?
joy|NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
anger|I don't understand - the machine was supposed to cure Caesar. You did this - his blood is own your hands.
disgust|Your pet ghoul smells like ass.
surprise|A flying robot? Man, I must be fucked up.
anger|I should make you pay for your crimes!
surprise|I've never seen a robot like that before.
anger|Got time to save us too, or are you running errands for your NCR masters?
joy|Nice work at the Tops, buddy.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
sadness|This place's got a weird gloom after Miss Weintraub died.
sadness|I'm gonna miss having Anderson around.
anger|We're only trying to help people, and you're not making it easy on us.
joy|That Legion boss would've never taken the city, but I'm glad he's a goner.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
surprise|I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
disgust|You better watch yourself around here. I'm not going to put up with any crazy shit.
anger|I don't get you. Sometimes you help the Followers, and other times you work against us.
joy|Welcome back to my baby.
anger|We'll talk again when you've destroyed whatever is down in that bunker - not before.
fear|You're not going to cause any problems, right?
anger|It's quiet out here. We like to keep it that way.
anger|I should make you pay for your crimes!
sadness|I'm gonna miss having Anderson around.
anger|Die, NCR filth!
anger|Hold up, I gotta have a chat with Cachino.
anger|How the hell did the monorail blow up? Someone's bringing back luck into the Strip, I tell you.
anger|I warned you, now it is time to eat hot fucking lead.
sadness|So close to the Vegas wall, too, don't that beat all. Must have happened during the day, though, they hadn't made a camp.
disgust|How disgusting. You can see that strange mechanical mongrel's brain.
surprise|Fiends don't come here no more, they say.
disgust|I heard Private Stone was caught stealing medical supplies. I always hated that guy.
surprise|First Vegas, now NCR and Legion? You're being courted more than a Redding widow.
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
surprise|The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
anger|What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
joy|When I get back home, I'll tell everyone I met you.
anger|I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
joy|I wouldn't mind hitting that. She put out?
joy|More fights, we want more.
surprise|I didn't know the Brotherhood had any people out here.
sadness|Can't help thinking that we've not seen the last of the Fiends yet.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
surprise|What the hell?Is that a half-robot dog?
surprise|Wish I could've seen what's inside the 38.
surprise|Are you ready to go to him? To tell him to begin the assault?
disgust|What, did... did you put a plug in his cocktube to make him explode?
joy|That Legion boss would've never taken the city, but I'm glad he's a goner.
sadness|I'd like to pay my respects to the end of Cassidy Caravans, check out the site where they died.
joy|Yeah! Fight! Fight!
sadness|Won't ever make enough to live outside.
sadness|Either that or his Securitrons' AI is too primitive to recognize the threat. Neither answer is particularly comforting.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
fear|I've heard stories about you. No one knows what you'll do next.
joy|I hope Red Lucy gives us the *big* monsters, next.
joy|One of New Vegas' finest! You are always welcome in the Strip.
fear|The last patrol I was on got hit by a Legion raiding party and I barely survived. I don't want to go back out there again.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
surprise|Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
anger|Don't talk to me!
joy|I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
sadness|Westside, huh? I heard about what happened with Anderson. Can't say I'm surprised. He was always a fringe operator in the Followers.
sadness|I heard President Kimball was attacked at Hoover Dam. I can barely believe it.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
joy|I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
sadness|I'm gonna miss having Anderson around.
joy|Howdy, come try your luck? I hope's on your side.
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
fear|I'm not scared of you. Give me a good reason to call the law and, I swear, you'll regret it.
anger|What?
fear|You scare and confuse me, and I think you should be nicer to people.
joy|I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
surprise|Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
joy|Well, now, look what rolled in. What, you getting lonely out there?
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
anger|The time for battle will soon be upon us. Legatus Lanius draws nigh. When he arrives, my Legion will assault Hoover Dam.
joy|"Fuck off, ass-breath!" You've already heard my spiel - you really gotta go see Hadrian!
anger|I'd rather kill you than talk to you.
fear|Why's that tower on the Strip all fucking lit up now, huh? I don't like it.
anger|What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
joy|I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
anger|If you interfere with me getting some sleep again, I'm going to have you killed. We will talk later.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
surprise|Word is those tough guys rangers are here. I ain't seen them myself, but how scary can they be?
surprise|You've been making a name for yourself around here already.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
anger|You're just as bad as the NCR or the Legion. What did the Followers ever do to you?
fear|Caesar's death is good news for the NCR. For everyone, most likely.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
joy|Good to see a friend of our government.
joy|NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
joy|Couldn't stay away, huh baby? Shoulda known. What can I do for you?
joy|Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
joy|Don't worry boss, I'm sure Caesar just wants to invite you over for coffee or something. That's all.
anger|I'd rather kill you than talk to you.
disgust|I'm sure pissing off the two most powerful factions in the Mojave was a good move. How could it not be? It was your idea.
joy|House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
fear|The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
surprise|It's amazing he was never court-martialed. He always had good things to say about my father. Said I was like him in a lot of ways. I wish I knew.
joy|I heard you talking to Horowitz, and can't thank you enough for what you've done for us.
fear|You killed him! What have we done to you?
joy|Won't have to worry about those Fiend assholes for some time now, huh?
sadness|I'm just glad to be safe over here on the Strip.
joy|So much for Lem, you should have seen it, guts flying everywhere.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
anger|Hey, I'm leaving and I don't have anything more to say to you, so get the fuck out of my face.
joy|With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
joy|Cheyenne, stay. Don't worry, she won't bite unless I tell her to.
fear|Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
fear|You seem really... high-strung. You know, I'm sure some of what I make my chems out of was an antipsychotic at some point....
surprise|If the Legion can equip their men so well, maybe they can take care of me too.
fear|I need to talk to you about something, if you have a minute.
joy|The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
joy|That Legion boss would've never taken the city, but I'm glad he's a goner.
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
surprise|I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
joy|A Follower is always welcome among our people.
joy|I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
anger|I want you to destroy the Mojave Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel. It's not a full-strength chapter, mind you. The Profligates...
fear|You killed him! What have we done to you?
sadness|If someone can blow up the Monorail, I guess we're not safe even in the Strip.
anger|I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
surprise|You hear about this courier doing shit around the Strip? Like what, delivering mail?
fear|Don't you see everything is going to hell? I'm gonna go find someplace safe to hide out at.
anger|What do you want?
joy|Stories of how you saved President Kimball are the talk of the Strip, friend!
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
joy|The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
fear|I don't want any trouble, mister. What do you want?
anger|What makes you think I give a damn about you?
anger|Now that same sigil is on the Platinum Chip you were carrying. Isn't that interesting?
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
joy|The Followers are lucky to have a friend like you.
surprise|Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
joy|I've heard of your fights at The Thorn. People down here don't stop talking about you.
joy|That Caesar bastard had it coming.
joy|One of these days, Red Lucy's going to show off her Deathclaws.
disgust|It's good to have the Khans on our side, but I hope they keep them out of the Strip. Those savages smell like Bighorner's ass.
anger|Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
fear|What do you want with me?
joy|I can't wait to see what fights next.
joy|Hey hey! Welcome, welcome, welcome to the finest entertainment experience in New Vegas! My name is Tommy Torini, and how can I make your day?
joy|With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
surprise|You've beat Night Stalkers, right? We don't see that often down here.
surprise|NCR is going to be rip shit about losing their little train.
anger|Something you need?
joy|I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
fear|The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
disgust|Gathering junk's not the most exciting work, but it's a living.
anger|Ready to leave yet? This place puts my teeth on edge.
anger|Stupid Big Horners were making noise all night again.
anger|Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
fear|Hang on there, traveler. You'll want to steer clear of this place - the whole town is irradiated to high hell.
fear|Uh-oh, I'll call the Securitrons if you try anything crazy with me, understand?
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
joy|I've read Mr. House's obituary. Had a high opinion of himself, didn't he?
anger|What makes you think I give a damn about you?
surprise|Never seen a guardian dog like that before.
joy|It's much cooler up here. I love it.
joy|You're the one who busted those assholes at Gomorrah, huh? Good work!
fear|I've told you Powder Gangers everything I know! Please don't hit me anymore!
anger|You better be sleeping with one eye open.
joy|New Vegas, paradise, my ass.
joy|Wish I could've seen you capture those beasts for our Thorn!
sadness|The Tops is a real snooze fest. I hope they get some new shows soon.
joy|You want to gamble with class? Hit the Ultra-Luxe, if you don't mind being serviced by masked creeps.
joy|You do well to serve the Legion.
fear|Run! Beasts got free!
surprise|What the hell?Is that a half-robot dog?
anger|Now, if you're done fucking around, let's settle accounts the old-fashioned way.
joy|We owe you so much for saving our President.
joy|I thank you for saving my life. You're a warrior and a healer - a rare combination.
joy|If you ever need the assistance of the Followers, just ask.
anger|You and I have got nothing to talk about.
joy|Nicely done. I'm sure people will appreciate the power. I hate to have to rely on it, but out here... it makes a big difference.
anger|What do you need?
surprise|I hear Mr. House cashed out. Ain't much to miss.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
joy|I thank you for saving my life. Arcade will be a fine addition to my retinue.
surprise|How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
surprise|Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
fear|The Khans are all gone, wonder if they left behind their shit for making our goods.
joy|After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
sadness|It's hard to find justice in all of this, but I suppose this is as close as it gets. Thanks.
anger|We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
sadness|You seriously ought to mellow out, take some chill pills. I could sell you some, if you want.
joy|Fuck off! Win your own fucking lottery!
sadness|I hope nothing happens on my watch. I'm too damn tired to fight back right now.
sadness|This place's got a weird gloom after Miss Weintraub died.
anger|I swear, I could kill you right now and never look back.
anger|I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
joy|You're wise to serve the Legion by choice.
joy|Good to see a friend of our government.
disgust|If we run, we might still catch Benny! Well, you might. I'll just be wheezing along behind you.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
disgust|I think you'd better get out of here.
anger|Everything to the Strip and McCarran? Are you kidding?
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
disgust|A woman actually proved useful for once. Caesar was bold to put his life in your hands.
anger|What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
disgust|I thought there was a chance you'd change - not any longer, being a fucker is who you are.
joy|I hope you're doing well, friend!
joy|NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
anger|Even more interesting, there's a slot about the same size as the Chip on the console that opens the hatch. So you know what I think?
anger|What do you need?
sadness|I hear more troops are gathering at Hoover Dam. Things are probably going to get pretty messy over there real soon.
fear|Just, don't do anything crazy.
anger|I don't trust those creeps at the Ultra-Luxe.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
surprise|I've never seen a robot like that before.
fear|Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
anger|You better scram before I sic the entire Strip after you.
joy|Now that you've killed that Caesar bastard, the Strip's really going to bloom!
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
sadness|Urh...
anger|I'm not going to talk to you!
surprise|You hear about this courier doing shit around the Strip? Like what, delivering mail?
anger|Flails of God!
anger|There are a half-dozen troopers in shouting distance. Best remember that before you try anything.
joy|I'm glad to see you.
fear|What do you want with me?
sadness|I can't believe President Kimball is dead. He was a great leader for the NCR.
joy|I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
anger|Attack me. Give me license to kill you.
anger|What makes you think I give a damn about you?
surprise|You've taken down Cazadores! Didn't think I'd ever see that.
sadness|Moreno took the fall of the Enclave hard. He never questioned his orders, never questioned the legitimacy of what the Enclave was doing.
disgust|All that wealth is wasted on the Strip. There are people in Freeside who need food and medicine.
fear|Run! Beasts got free!
anger|I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
anger|Wait, wait, wait a second. What's going on? Am I playing Vergil to your Dante?
joy|Smell that air! Couldn't ya just drink it like booze!
joy|Troublemaker, don't you dare hurt my baby.
anger|Just keep on walking.
joy|I love this place, but I can't take this kind of stress anymore. I'm going to head back west to see my grandkids.
anger|People like you are the reason the Followers haven't brought civilization back to the wasteland yet.
joy|We should straighten those thugs at Gomorrah.
joy|I heard that some of the NCR Rangers are on their way to help us out. We'll make short work of the Legion with their help.
disgust|The Legion is using our dead troops as booby traps. I'd think twice before rushing to someone's aid.
surprise|How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
anger|We're only trying to help people, and you're not making it easy on us.
disgust|Eesh, boss. Just... eesh.
joy|Good to see you, amicus.
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
joy|Going to place me a good bet at The Thorn.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
joy|You're a model citizen, thank you.
joy|I can't imagine this place will ever disappear.
anger|Give me cause, Profligate.
surprise|Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
joy|These bastards got what they deserved.
joy|I bet NCR troops can't wait to clean the sewers.
anger|If you're smart, you'll find somewhere else to be.
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
anger|You'll pay for what you did to our soldiers at Forlorn Hope, murderer!
joy|In the meantime, the Profligates have prepared a welcome gift for us. The President of the NCR intends to visit Hoover Dam.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
joy|Those Legion beasts needed to be put down, like the vermin they are!
anger|So what, we chase that little cocksucker down or what? He's got to stop running sometime, and that's when we'll get him.
joy|The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
surprise|Wish I could've seen what's inside the 38.
joy|Even Presidents die, huh? Good.
anger|Let's get to fighting! Now is not the time to talk!
anger|You better be sleeping with one eye open.
surprise|Someone got Mr. House. The Strip's going to change, I'd bet on it.
fear|Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
fear|Just, don't do anything crazy.
joy|Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
fear|I'm not really comfortable having you in here, so make it quick.
surprise|Holy fuck. Never seen a mutant like that before.
fear|Motor Runner dead? Who the fuck gonna run the show now?
surprise|I heard Mr. House's done for. I hope the Sewers don't turn for the worse.
fear|House signing up with the NCR, you hear? Fucking sell-out.
joy|Going to place me a good bet at The Thorn.
anger|In the past, I'd have had someone like you executed for showing their face here - consider yourself lucky I don't have the warriors to spare.
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
surprise|Word is the Khans signed a treaty with the NCR. Never saw that coming.
anger|Hey, come on, pal, I'm trying to put on a show here!
anger|Yeah?
surprise|The Kings got hit hard. I don't know how many of them are still alive, if any.
fear|Just, don't do anything crazy.
surprise|And who are you to come before me... you don't bear the mark of the Bear, yet are ready for battle.
joy|Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
fear|In case it's not obvious, I think you should redirect the power to Freeside and outer Vegas.
joy|I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
fear|You're not going to raze us to the ground, like you did to Forlorn Hope, right?
joy|Yeah! Who won the lottery? I did!
joy|Hey, It's great what you're doing for The Thorn, way to go!
joy|Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
joy|It's good to have you here. What can I do for you?
joy|You do well to serve the Legion.
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
anger|What do you need?
sadness|I wish we were back at our Vault.
fear|I don't want any trouble, okay?
anger|I don't get you. Sometimes you help the Followers, and other times you work against us.
fear|Don't... do anything to me, okay?
joy|Hey, girl. You need something from me?
joy|I really hope that incident at REPCONN doesn't drive people away. Novac was starting to do well!
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
joy|Caesar was right to put his trust in you. Your skill in medicine is beyond anything I've ever seen before.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
fear|The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
sadness|Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
fear|Uh-oh, I'll call the Securitrons if you try anything crazy with me, understand?
sadness|Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
anger|I'm not exactly a mercenary, but taking out scumbags of this magnitude wouldn't cause me to lose any sleep.
anger|What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
fear|What is that thing? I've never seen a blue mutant.
joy|You've done the Legion a great service by healing whatever was wrong with Caesar.
anger|What do you need?
disgust|The salvage business has really slowed down since those ghouls took over REPCONN.
surprise|The Khans used to be a big deal around here, but look at them now. There's talk that they were all killed up in the mountains.
anger|I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
joy|I guess that didn't work out very well for him. Should I watch my back around you?
anger|Even with the Boomers to deal with, you have questions?
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
anger|I only work for caravans, all right? Try someone else.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
anger|I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
joy|Want to see the best of New Vegas? Our sewers got it - The Thorn!
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
sadness|Major Polatli is putting everyone on double shifts to make up for recent losses to the Legion. That guy never gives up.
joy|Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
joy|I never thought I'd see the day when the NCR and the Kings started getting along.
anger|Hey pal, thanks for helping us shape things up. You're good people.
anger|You've got a lot of nerve showing your face around here. You better get out before I throw you out.
sadness|Can you spare some caps, mister?
joy|Stories of how you saved President Kimball are the talk of the Strip, friend!
joy|We owe you so much for saving our President.
surprise|Whoa. New chick.
sadness|To him, it was all one unbroken chain, from Washington to Richardson. When we left Navarro, I remember looking up at Moreno.
joy|When I get back home, I'll tell everyone I met you.
joy|They have a fantastic menu at the diner.
sadness|I shouldn't be surprised at what happened with Moreno. I hoped that after all this time, he could put his anger behind him.
surprise|... Huh?
anger|Ethel, darling! I'll... I'll join you soon again! Someone's gonna pay first, though.
anger|Join the Great Khans, what the hell is Cooke thinking?
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
anger|I swear, I could kill you right now and never look back.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
anger|Let's look around, something stinks.
joy|I kinda like being a farmer.
surprise|You're wasting no time in making a name for yourself around here, huh?
surprise|I'm beginning to hear troubling rumors from my advisors. Would you know anything about that?
fear|What do you want with me?
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
anger|One of those beasts cut my friend in half! How the hell did they escape from Red Lucy?
joy|Taking down a Giant Radscorpion, by yourself, has made you popular down here.
anger|Don't talk to me!
joy|More fights, we want more.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
anger|Wish the Followers would get me some better armor.
sadness|If someone can blow up the Monorail, I guess we're not safe even in the Strip.
surprise|So, the cub enters the wolf's den. What do you want, cub?
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
fear|So that's it then. Benny's dead, and I'm the boss now. What can I do for you?
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
sadness|...
surprise|Weird, someone just told me that the Khans split the Vegas area. Wonder where they went, and why.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
sadness|If someone can blow up the Monorail, I guess we're not safe even in the Strip.
joy|What can I do for you, boss?
surprise|People lived in here for hundreds of years, can you imagine?
anger|What's wrong with you? Killing Anderson isn't going to bring Corporal White back.
surprise|You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
disgust|Sure hope you know what throwing in with the Legion means. Helping them running roughshod over the West is an Old World kind of cruel.
joy|It was a matter of time before someone got to Mr. House.
joy|I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
fear|I don't know what you have against the Followers, but I don't want any trouble.
joy|This new act is out of sight, baby! We're bringing in the caps like a Nuka-Cola bottling plant!
joy|After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
fear|That guy's got cold eyes. Definitely ex-military.
surprise|Caesar may have deemed you worthy to bear his mark, but your reputation preceeds you.
anger|Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
surprise|I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
joy|Traveling into the Strip just got a lot easier now that the Fiends' leaders are dead.
surprise|I've heard about you.
joy|It's a pleasure to see you, friend! Best of luck during your stay.
joy|I wouldn't mind hitting that. She put out?
joy|One day I'll get to see Deathclaws tear through Fiends!
anger|Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker when I find out who did it.
anger|I bet I'd get a reward for bringing your head to the authorities, assassin!
anger|Don't listen to a word No-bark says. He spouts nothing but nonsense.
surprise|Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
joy|I didn't expect someone as famous as you here. What can I do for you?
surprise|The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
joy|Poindexter says all our troubles is over now, and we won't have to go to war. I guess that's good, but I don't understand why.
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
joy|Sorting and manipulating intelligence is what I do. It's what rangers are supposed to do.
surprise|You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
anger|We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
anger|Lucius says I stare into space, blink a few times, then keep talking like nothing happened. So what's the diagnosis?
joy|That Caesar bastard had it coming.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
anger|Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker if we find out who did it.
fear|House signing up with the NCR, you hear? Fucking sell-out.
joy|You're the one who saved us! Thank you.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
surprise|Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|A little payback feels real good.
anger|I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
joy|Something I can do you for?
anger|Once I'm done here, I hope they assign me to find the son of a bitch that took down our President.
joy|With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
surprise|The tables turned for Mr. House. What next, huh?
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
joy|House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
fear|I probably shouldn't be talking to you, but what do you want?
joy|Hot damn do I love this place.
sadness|Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
joy|I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
sadness|I'm here because of you, so I figure you're the one most deserving of it. It should protect you from everything short of a Plasma Caster.
sadness|Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
fear|Caesar's death is good news for the NCR. For everyone, most likely.
joy|Oh, hello Emily. Yes, it is I, Arcade Gannon, fellow member of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
anger|I spent months feeding the Omertas bribes, nursing their betrayal, and you've ruined all that.
disgust|You really enjoy dragging me into situations where I get shot at, don't you boss?
joy|We find this "friend" Benny of yours, looking forward to rattling his cage.
fear|I'm no botanist, but I think this may not be entirely natural.
fear|Get away! I'm not part of your fight!
joy|Hey, nice to meet you. Do you need help with something?
surprise|Someone got Mr. House. The Strip's going to change, I'd bet on it.
joy|That was a good day for The Thorn.
surprise|Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
surprise|What on earth is *that* creature?
surprise|Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
surprise|The owner of the Vault was murdered. I thought we were safe inside the Strip.
joy|I got to hand it to you, baby, you did an 18-karat job on this one. My schedule's so full I couldn't put on new acts if I wanted to!
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
anger|Until Mr. House has been dealt with, you and I have nothing to talk about.
anger|Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
surprise|A flying robot? Man, I must be fucked up.
surprise|I've never seen a robot like that before.
surprise|The big showdown between the NCR and the Legion is coming soon, believe you me.
joy|Without leadership, the Fiends are as good as dead!
sadness|Well, now that I'm free of the Outpost, was wondering if you'd mind making a detour.
joy|I can't wait to see what fights next.
surprise|I still can't believe the King agreed to work with the NCR. But he's the King, and the King knows best.
disgust|I'm on my way to have some private time, give me some peace.
anger|You'll pay for what you did to our soldiers at Forlorn Hope, murderer!
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
fear|Don't... do anything to me, okay?
joy|I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
anger|I'd kill you right now if I could.
joy|That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
anger|Got time to save us too, or are you running errands for your NCR masters?
sadness|Can't help thinking that we've not seen the last of the Fiends yet.
joy|I'm glad to see you.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
surprise|Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
anger|What do you need?
sadness|I heard Chief Hanlon is dead. How are we going to fight the Legion without him?
anger|What the hell do you want?
joy|I'm sure you had to use a lot of healing powder on Caesar. Well done.
joy|House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
sadness|The Strip ain't nothing but a monster. Chews folks up, sucks out their caps, and spits 'em back out.
joy|Traveling into the Strip just got a lot easier now that the Fiends' leaders are dead.
disgust|Your words have done nothing but delay the inevitable. Now, see what my hounds and my blade will bring to you.
surprise|You've beat Night Stalkers, right? We don't see that often down here.
joy|That's why I've made a decision: I'm naming you my heir. When I die, leadership of the Great Khans will pass to you.
anger|Even with the Brotherhood to deal with, you have questions?
surprise|The bots have enough firepower to arm a full platoon.
surprise|I didn't know the Brotherhood had any people out here.
joy|Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
joy|That was a good day for The Thorn.
sadness|Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
joy|I wouldn't mind hitting that. She put out?
anger|You gotta piss someone off to pull guard duty out here.
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
fear|You're not going to cause any problems, right?
anger|You got the survivors of the Enclave back together so you could convince them to help Caesar?!
anger|This is my room, now you get the fuck out before you get yourself hurt.
anger|Hey, thanks for all the help back there.
joy|I hope you're doing well, friend!
disgust|Mojave's almost buzzing like a Cazador now... must be all the blood Legion and NCR are spilling over the Colorado.
fear|You killed him! What have we done to you?
joy|Hey, friend. Need something?
fear|Caesar's death is good news for the NCR. For everyone, most likely.
joy|Taking down a Giant Radscorpion, by yourself, has made you popular down here.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
anger|I'm not going to talk to you!
joy|I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
surprise|Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
joy|Want to see the best of New Vegas? Our sewers got it - The Thorn!
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
sadness|I came east to strike it rich, and now I'm broker than ever. What do I tell my family back home?
joy|No way I'm going back to prison.
surprise|Glad that fucker House is gone.
anger|You better scram before I sic the entire Strip after you.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
fear|Looks like Mr. House run out of luck, huh?
surprise|The Great Khans tribe went mad. During the battle at the Dam, they attacked both the Legion and the NCR.
surprise|I've never seen so many pretty lights in my life.
anger|If I hear one more loser moan about losing everything they own on the Strip, I may shoot him in the head.
surprise|Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
joy|Wish I could've seen you capture those beasts for our Thorn!
joy|They have a fantastic menu at the diner.
joy|You're always welcome among the Followers, friend.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
surprise|I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
surprise|I heard you've killed Deathclaws at The Thorn. I couldn't believe it!
sadness|I still don't know how this is all going to shake out in the end, but at least the Enclave can atone a bit for all the damage it's done.
sadness|Can't help thinking that we've not seen the last of the Fiends yet.
anger|What a load of Brahmin shit! Can you believe that guy?
joy|That's a true friend of this wonderful place! Lady Luck shines on you.
joy|One of these days, Red Lucy's going to show off her Deathclaws.
surprise|So far working with the NCR hasn't been too bad. If anything, things seem to be getting better.
sadness|Those poor NCR soldiers... now where will they get their hookers and gambling?
disgust|Oh, good. Now there's an army of robots. You don't do things by halves, do you, boss?
joy|I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
joy|We owe you so much for saving our President.
anger|But something tells me you're not here for that. What do you want?
joy|That is one battered Eyebot. It's a miracle it's still functioning.
surprise|Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
surprise|Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
fear|Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
anger|We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
surprise|The robots here look different than others I've seen.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
joy|Great fighting today.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
joy|Us NCR folk got to stick together, even if the Strip is the safest place in New Vegas.
joy|One of New Vegas' finest! You are always welcome in the Strip.
joy|That Caesar bastard had it coming.
joy|You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
sadness|There are so many refugees to care for.
joy|The Followers are lucky to have a friend like you.
surprise|You're the talk of the day around the casino tables.
surprise|Great, just when you think the NCR can't possibly sink their claws deeper, the town of Primm signs up to join the Republic.
disgust|And who is this before me in the colors of the Legion. An envoy... dressed as an insult to all that carry out Caesar's will.
anger|I think the Platinum Chip opens those doors - doors that can't be pried open or drilled open or blasted open. Because all that, I tried.
fear|Why's that tower on the Strip all fucking lit up now, huh? I don't like it.
anger|With Chomps in jail, who's going to run things at the quarry? He was our most experienced guy!
joy|NCR should take this chance, now that Mr. House's out of the way.
surprise|I've heard about you.
joy|Hi again. You here to play?
surprise|Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
anger|We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
joy|I walked all the way from Hub! Thought I'd rest my feet here a day or two, then I head onto the Strip fresh.
surprise|Doc Henry always was a hard one to figure out. It didn't seem to matter whether he was working with humans or dogs.
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
joy|Every time you come around, the brass gets their pants in a bunch. Keep on coming by.
anger|People like you are the reason the Followers haven't brought civilization back to the wasteland yet.
anger|So I finally get to meet the courier who's accomplished so much in so little time. That is why I summoned you here, right?
joy|Even Presidents die, huh? Good.
anger|Don't talk to me!
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
joy|You're a model citizen, thank you.
joy|Nice work at the Tops, buddy.
sadness|Maybe when this is all over, they'll find time to look after us.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
joy|That's a true friend of this wonderful place! Lady Luck shines on you.
anger|Enough! This is pointless. I'm dead to the Legion either way. I'll tell you what I know.
anger|I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
surprise|Never seen a guardian dog like that before.
surprise|The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
fear|Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.
joy|Good to see you, amicus.
fear|I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
joy|House dead, Strip can belong to anyone who wants it. Fiends to rule.
joy|Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
joy|My office is right here in case you need anything. Just ask for Ramos.
sadness|Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
fear|I can't believe we're allowed inside the Lucky 38. That place has been a legend since before the War....
anger|My forces are in position to assault the Dam. Legatus Lanius has assumed command.
joy|We need more people like you around.
sadness|You did good and you did it well. Work a ranger would be proud of. I'll handle the rest from here.
joy|The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
joy|I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
joy|I'm a little rusty with it but... I think I can manage. As long as you've got my back, of course.
disgust|Those rockets over at REPCONN were the NCR's doing. Trying to keep us scared so they can stick around to "protect" us.
sadness|Won't ever make enough to live outside.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
fear|After what happened to Mr. House, nobody knows for sure what's in play for the Strip.
anger|What do you need?
anger|Why did you not attack President Kimball?
anger|I trust this payment is adequate compensation for your troubles. Now, lest we grow sentimental here...
joy|Good to see a friend of our government.
disgust|Are you fucking high right now? God, I can smell it from here. Keep that shit away from me.
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
surprise|We've heard about you from the officers at our embassy.
anger|Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
joy|House all dead, we should hit the Strip. Rip shit up.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
disgust|Get the fuck out of my room.
surprise|Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
joy|I thank you for saving my life. The Auto-Doc module you recovered did the trick.
fear|Who are you? How did you find this place?
anger|You want to die? Fine!
joy|We each serve the Legion, in our way.
surprise|Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
disgust|Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
fear|I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
anger|Fuck that Fiend bastard. Wish I would've seen him die.
fear|That guy's got cold eyes. Definitely ex-military.
surprise|You've beat Night Stalkers, right? We don't see that often down here.
joy|Saw a monster rip a man in half at The Thorn.
surprise|I hear Mr. House cashed out. Ain't much to miss.
anger|I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
anger|Got time to save us too, or are you running errands for your NCR masters?
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
joy|Since you convinced me to help out with the defense of Hoover Dam, I figured I'd haul it out of storage.
anger|What makes you think I give a damn about you?
anger|Go to hell.
anger|Don't talk to me!
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
joy|I can't imagine this place will ever disappear.
surprise|I didn't think anyone could kill an NCR Ranger in single combat.
disgust|The salvage business has really slowed down since those ghouls took over REPCONN.
sadness|Don't think I'll make it topside any time soon.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
surprise|You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
fear|The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
anger|What do you need?
disgust|Come to my office, we'll have a little chat with Cachino.
sadness|I wish the rest of the Vault were accessible.
surprise|Everyone's talking about Hoover Dam nowadays. I wish the battle would just happen already. The suspense is killing me.
anger|We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
joy|A Follower is always welcome among our people.
joy|You really saved our asses out there against the Legion. Thanks.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
joy|Feel better? You should, that was the good stuff. Need anything else?
joy|Did you hear about the Legion Defeat at Nelson? We're winning back our territories.
disgust|All that wealth is wasted on the Strip. There are people in Freeside who need food and medicine.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
surprise|What on earth is *that* creature?
surprise|Isn't that Cass? I heard she'd gotten out of the caravan business.
joy|If it isn't the guy that saved President Kimball. We owe you a big debt of gratitude. If Kimball died, I don't know what would have happened.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
surprise|Can you imagine how much electricity it takes to keep this Vault running?
joy|I thought all that touchy-feely teamwork bullshit was kind of fruity... but it kinda feels good knowing my squad's got my back.
joy|You keep yourself outta trouble around my baby, I'm watching you.
joy|It's good to see you around the Strip.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
surprise|So far working with the NCR hasn't been too bad. If anything, things seem to be getting better.
anger|I bet I'd get a reward for bringing your head to the authorities, assassin!
anger|One of those beasts cut my friend in half! How the hell did they escape from Red Lucy?
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
joy|You're becoming quite the political agitator. I can't say I'm displeased.
surprise|Well look at that! You aren't a Powder Ganger after all. I'd suggest against wearing that outfit around the townsfolk. You may get shot by accident.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
surprise|Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
joy|I'm glad that the Legion base at Nelson is destroyed. Now maybe we can get some rest.
anger|For as lack of adornment is said to become some women, so will this place, without your presence, bring delight.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
fear|Medicine's running low again.
joy|Saw a monster rip a man in half at The Thorn.
fear|So long as the Khans keep making it, I keep getting high.
sadness|We'll miss Red Lucy down here.
surprise|Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
anger|People like you are the reason the Followers haven't brought civilization back to the wasteland yet.
joy|I never thought I'd see the day when the NCR and the Kings started getting along.
joy|Glad to see you! Need a patch-job?
joy|It's good to see you around the Strip.
surprise|I heard you've killed Deathclaws at The Thorn. I couldn't believe it!
disgust|God, there's almost nothing left. Looks like whoever it was - was just in the mood for killing.
anger|Let's go!
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
disgust|Have you found the components we discussed?
joy|A Follower is always welcome among our people.
joy|Shit, look who it is, the crazy one! What up?
surprise|NCR is going to be rip shit about losing their little train.
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
joy|I hear we got reinforced by the troops that were in Boulder City. It's good to have some extra support around here.
anger|What the hell do you want?
anger|Goddammit, go away! Come back when I've had some sleep!
joy|Ahh, overly-elaborate mob schemes to take over Vegas. Reminds me of the days before the War.
anger|You're not exactly making friends around here, are you?
joy|I hope the Fiends have learned their lesson.
fear|Looks like Mr. House run out of luck, huh?
joy|I can't wait to see the Strip. I hear it's so beautiful!
sadness|It's an inhumane kind of public service when people and the basic resources they need become numbers in a ledger.
surprise|So you're the one that has been running errands for Colonel Moore. Do you need something?
disgust|The salvage business has really slowed down since those ghouls took over REPCONN.
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
joy|You doing right by Tommy, baby. Two new acts? We're making this joint jump!
joy|You honor the Great Khans with your presence. What can I do to help you?
joy|Howdy, come try your luck? I hope's on your side.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
joy|I hope the Fiends have learned their lesson.
joy|That is one battered Eyebot. It's a miracle it's still functioning.
joy|Okay, okay, I admit it - knowing how to use these guns right is pretty cool.
fear|I thought those Securitrons were creepy enough already. Now, they have soldier faces on them, that's even creepier.
sadness|I'm gonna miss having Anderson around.
disgust|I guess I should be grateful you didn't activate the laser.
anger|Now that same sigil is on the Platinum Chip Benny was carrying when we captured him. Isn't that interesting?
joy|You saved the NCR's head honcho, sure you can save a bunch of low-life scum like us.
fear|After what happened to Mr. House, nobody knows for sure what's in play for the Strip.
fear|Get away! I'm not part of your fight!
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
joy|NCR should head back to their lands, I'm sure *their* people miss them.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
surprise|People lived in here for hundreds of years, can you imagine?
joy|Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
anger|Beat it, or I'll call the bots on you right quick.
joy|Thanks again for finding those supplies. I've already started putting them to good use.
joy|That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
anger|I'm sick of the sob stories you hear around here. If you don't know when to stop gambling, that's no one's fault but your own.
joy|Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
joy|Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
joy|Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
joy|The beasts don't look so tough behind bars, huh?
anger|If you want to get fucked up, Gomorrah's the place to go. Wish I was there now.
anger|...and they can keep their freedom. If you find they aren't amenable to this offer, destroy them.
surprise|Look at that - a friendly Nightkin. What's it doing here?
fear|You're not going to cause any problems, right?
joy|My lucky day, running into our President's savior!
joy|That's a true friend of this wonderful place! Lady Luck shines on you.
joy|Thanks for helping us keep the Strip safe.
anger|What makes you think I give a damn about you?
anger|You're an enemy of the Followers, as far as I'm concerned. I don't care how you've helped us.
surprise|An envoy of Vegas, yet you carry yourself for battle. If so, you cannot *truly* be of that city of cowards.
anger|Don't talk to me!
surprise|Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
joy|Howdy.
fear|All the noise at REPCONN scared the hell out of me.
joy|NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
joy|Want to see the best of New Vegas? Our sewers got it - The Thorn!
anger|At some point he became so fixated on large scale results that he lost the concept of "the common good" along the way.
fear|Ahhh! Somebody call in the Rangers!
joy|It's always a pleasure to see you around the camp.
surprise|Shit, you just piss folks off wherever you go, huh?
fear|I don't want any trouble, okay?
anger|Wish the Followers would get me some better armor.
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
joy|Haven't found any Radroaches, so far.
joy|This place smells like booze and sex. That's why I always come back.
anger|You're just as bad as the NCR or the Legion. What did the Followers ever do to you?
anger|I'm not going to talk to you!
fear|You killed him! What have we done to you?
anger|What are you looking at?
joy|Us NCR folk got to stick together, even if the Strip is the safest place in New Vegas.
joy|Aha. The brave photographer returns. Good to see you.
disgust|Oh, it's you. You need something repaired or something?
fear|You ready to deal with Benny yet?
surprise|What the hell?Is that a half-robot dog?
surprise|I've never seen a robot like that before.
joy|House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
surprise|The Khans used to be a big deal around here, but look at them now. There's talk that they were all killed up in the mountains.
joy|Ha ha, fuck me, Jack's shit is still the best!
surprise|Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
joy|Hello there youngster. Welcome to my baby.
joy|You saved the NCR's head honcho, sure you can save a bunch of low-life scum like us.
surprise|What on earth is *that* creature?
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
fear|Aren't you the guy that was shooting up The Tops?
disgust|And so the unpredictable one returns. What do you want from us?
anger|You know everything you need to know. Be on your way.
anger|Well, we've had some laughs, you and I, but it looks like you're a crazy person and I'm going to have to leave.
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
anger|Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
joy|You better control thatthing. Bots can't be trusted.
anger|Wish I'd gotten a bullet in that Fiend...
fear|All the noise at REPCONN scared the hell out of me.
anger|What the hell do you want?
joy|NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
joy|One day I'll get to see Deathclaws tear through Fiends!
disgust|Go bother Jason, smoothskin. I don't like having you around.
surprise|You've taken down Cazadores! Didn't think I'd ever see that.
anger|You're just as bad as the NCR or the Legion. What did the Followers ever do to you?
surprise|Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
joy|I'm not surprised Kimball survived. We NCR people are made of hard stuff.
surprise|I heard you were wandering around. Haven't gotten yourself arrested yet, huh?
surprise|I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
disgust|You and me we're done traveling together. I want nothing more to do with you.
anger|I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
anger|Howdy, son! How can I help you? But make it quick. Goddamn heat's worse in this town than in the middle of a Brahmin herd at noon.
surprise|The robots here look different than others I've seen.
joy|Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
joy|House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
surprise|Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
joy|Good to have you around!
fear|Keep an eye out. I still think there's a few out there.
anger|I doubt I can help you. I'm just a kid, you know.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
surprise|I heard it got nasty at the Tops; wish I could've seen the shooting.
anger|Don't talk to me!
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
surprise|The Kings got hit hard. I don't know how many of them are still alive, if any.
fear|Primm is going to be much tougher to push around with that new sheriff down there.
joy|Damn, baby, you bringing in so many acts the Rad Pack's taking half the night off! I'm seriously thinking about charging them for the free liquor.
joy|You dispatched President Kimball with real skill. Right under their noses, too - what a humiliation.
surprise|Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
fear|House is dead, wonder if Motor-Runner will let us hit the strip now.
joy|That Legion boss would've never taken the city, but I'm glad he's a goner.
joy|My lucky day, running into our President's savior!
surprise|Do not make Caesar wait! Lucullus awaits you on the dock.
joy|House all dead, we should hit the Strip. Rip shit up.
surprise|What on earth is *that* creature?
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
surprise|The big showdown between the NCR and the Legion is coming soon, believe you me.
joy|Fuck that Caesar dog! I'm going to drink in your name, all night!
joy|We need more people like you in the NCR.
fear|I don't want any trouble, okay?
fear|After what happened to Mr. House, nobody knows for sure what's in play for the Strip.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
fear|Look, I've got people to care for. I'm not looking for trouble.
joy|You serve the Legion well, amicus.
joy|That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
anger|Don't try my patience. A nod of my chin, and you'll be decorating a cross.
sadness|I'm gonna miss having Anderson around.
joy|Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
anger|Caesar is dead at your hands. This crime cannot go unpunished.
joy|New Vegas, paradise, my ass.
joy|What can I do for you?
fear|Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
joy|Until next time.
anger|You're not exactly making friends around here, are you?
joy|Everyone loves a good insult, am I right? So you'll love Hadrian, LIVE at the Aces Theater!
fear|You're not going to cause any problems, right?
fear|Is Benny taken care of yet?
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
joy|I've heard of your fights at The Thorn. People down here don't stop talking about you.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
fear|I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
disgust|Aw, shit, here comes the brown-noser. What you want?
fear|For the past two weeks, my left leg has been dragging. It's stiffer, hard to move. And you've seen me blank out.
sadness|We saw everything through the security monitor. I had no idea Moreno would ever pull something like that.
fear|The Khans are all gone, wonder if they left behind their shit for making our goods.
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
fear|Look, I've got people to care for. I'm not looking for trouble.
surprise|Do you often go toe-to-toe with guys dressed as tanks, boss? That might not be great for your life expectancy.
joy|You're a model citizen, thank you.
surprise|The tables turned for Mr. House. What next, huh?
surprise|I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
joy|Well, well, well, if it ain't the best-loved cat on the Strip in my theater! What can Tommy do for you, baby?
anger|One of those beasts cut my friend in half! How the hell did they escape from Red Lucy?
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
surprise|You hear about this courier doing shit around the Strip? Like what, delivering mail?
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
joy|I heard you snuffed that Benny guy. Good riddance, guy was a scumbag.
fear|Uh... wait. Are you here to deliver more billboard requests? Please tell me you're not a messenger on behalf of Mr. House.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
joy|NCR came all the way to save us, huh? Guess they missed the shit-holes.
anger|Don't talk to me!
joy|Wish I could've seen you capture those beasts for our Thorn!
anger|You're an enemy of the Followers, as far as I'm concerned. I don't care how you've helped us.
surprise|All hell broke loose when the creatures escaped from The Thorn!
anger|Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker if we find out who did it.
joy|Lady Luck's on your side. I hope some of that rubs off on me, Caesar killer!
joy|You're the one who busted those assholes at Gomorrah, huh? Good work!
anger|Whatever you're selling, I ain't buying.
surprise|I mean, a man nearly kills you, and your response is to track him across the breadth of the Mojave?
joy|That Caesar bastard had it coming.
fear|One of my buddies said that he saw Caesar out rallying the Legion. If that's true, we're definitely screwed.
surprise|The owner of the Vault was murdered. I thought we were safe inside the Strip.
fear|You see a Ranger in black, run the other way. Take you out from a quarter mile off.
anger|The question is... are you ready to get started?
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
joy|Taking down a Giant Radscorpion, by yourself, has made you popular down here.
joy|You're the one who busted those assholes at Gomorrah, huh? Good work!
joy|See Billy Knight, King of the One-Liners - LIVE at the Aces Theater! If you miss it, you'll "Take your life, please!"
joy|There's always more next day.
surprise|I heard you've killed Deathclaws at The Thorn. I couldn't believe it!
fear|The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
sadness|I heard the Legion took out another one of our patrols. If this continues there won't be many of us left.
joy|You're a model citizen, thank you.
joy|Haven't found any Radroaches, so far.
anger|Even with a President to kill, you have questions?
joy|Saw a monster rip a man in half at The Thorn.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
surprise|If you had asked me a month ago, I'd have said we'd never willingly work with the NCR. But look at us now.
surprise|Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
joy|House unplugged like a light. Wonder if he twitched before he bit it.
fear|Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
surprise|All hell broke loose when the creatures escaped from The Thorn!
fear|Looks like Mr. House run out of luck, huh?
joy|I kinda like being a farmer.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|Back west, you don't see too many of these. Lakes, I mean. Natural or man-made. Any kind, really.
surprise|Something else you need?
joy|New Vegas, paradise, my ass.
joy|Hey, It's great what you're doing for The Thorn, way to go!
surprise|Holy fuck. Never seen a mutant like that before.
joy|That Caesar bastard had it coming.
anger|If you're looking for supplies I'll make this easy for you... there aren't any.
sadness|Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
joy|I hope everyone on the surface is like you.
surprise|Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
anger|I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
anger|Some bastards killed President Kimball. Who's going to lead the NCR now?
anger|I hate it here, fucking sulfur stinks.
anger|You hear the losers around here complaining how they lost their shirts on the Strip? It's pathetic.
joy|There's nothing else like The Thorn!
joy|I'm glad to see you.
anger|We didn't get all of them. Talk later!
joy|House unplugged like a light. Wonder if he twitched before he bit it.
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
surprise|I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
joy|There are rewards for doing as I command. Today, your reward is vengeance. You get to decide how Benny dies.
joy|I can't wait to see what fights next.
joy|Hey hey! Welcome, welcome, welcome to the finest entertainment experience in New Vegas! My name is Tommy Torini, and how can I make your night?
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
sadness|Can't go anywhere else.
surprise|I heard Mr. House's done for. I hope the Sewers don't turn for the worse.
surprise|Day to day, week to week, he would question orders, subvert mission objectives, do anything he could to serve without serving.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
fear|Motor Runner dead? Who the fuck gonna run the show now?
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
anger|You're an enemy of the Followers, as far as I'm concerned. I don't care how you've helped us.
joy|NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
sadness|Quartermaster Mayes was yelling at us about rationing again. Where does the guy get the energy to yell so much while on rations?
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
anger|I swear, I could kill you right now and never look back.
joy|With all the people passing through lately, the town's been doing better than, well, ever.
disgust|Fuck, where are we gonna get our shit from now that the Khans are all buddy buddy with the NCR.
surprise|You've been making a name for yourself around here already.
sadness|Go on. Go fetch a ranger and do this right.
anger|For the Legion.
disgust|Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
joy|It's much cooler up here. I love it.
joy|That Fiend leader got what he fucking deserved.
anger|I tell you, something stinks about this Monorail attack!
surprise|Holy shit, did you here about the Monorail being destroyed? How the fuck did that happen?
disgust|Your pet ghoul smells like ass.
sadness|Won't ever make enough to live outside.
joy|I bet NCR troops can't wait to clean the sewers.
anger|Allow me to make this clear. Because you've been of service to me, I will forgive your crimes against my Legion this one time.
fear|People all scared of those robots on the Strip since they changed. Like who needs the Strip anyway?
joy|Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
joy|That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
surprise|Did blowing up that vault serve a purpose, or do you just like explosions?
joy|That was a good day for The Thorn.
surprise|Word is the Khans signed a treaty with the NCR. Never saw that coming.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
joy|You've proved yourself useful, at least.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
sadness|This place's got a weird gloom after Miss Weintraub died.
joy|Going to place me a good bet at The Thorn.
anger|I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
joy|"Hey, asshole!"
fear|Uh, howdy. Are you gonna be mean or nice this time?
surprise|Fiends don't come here no more, they say.
fear|I'm not scared of you. Give me a good reason to call the law and, I swear, you'll regret it.
fear|So long as the Khans keep making it, I keep getting high.
surprise|Fiends don't come here no more, they say.
joy|The beasts don't look so tough behind bars, huh?
disgust|Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
fear|Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
joy|I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
sadness|Or to the NCR soldiers who have to live with what they did here.
sadness|The Khans didn't seem so bad to me, but what do I know? I was locked up in a cell by a crazy Nightkin for years.
anger|Attack me. Give me license to kill you.
surprise|Can you imagine how much electricity it takes to keep this Vault running?
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
sadness|Most of the cargo's ash, too - not burned, looks like... disintegrated. When I heard the reports, I assumed "ash" meant "burned."
fear|If House is dead, how'd the lights get turned on in his place, huh?
fear|What do you want with me?
anger|Guess my last warning didn't sink in too well. Things don't change, and soon, I'm gone.
disgust|Extortion? Really? You go through all of this only to extort the people who are trying to help Westside? Unbelievable.
joy|We find this "friend" of yours, looking forward to adding some red to that checkered suit of his.
surprise|Interesting way of handling things. Very sub rosa.
fear|I really don't have anything you'd want.
surprise|Hey, you're the one that's been hunting the most dangerous beasts for The Thorn!
disgust|Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
fear|Primm is going to be much tougher to push around with that new sheriff down there.
joy|Now that you've killed that Caesar bastard, the Strip's really going to bloom!
joy|Hello again. Did you need something else?
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
joy|Silus dishonored himself when he let himself be captured, and he'll pay the price for that. But the NCR didn't learn anything valuable.
fear|You see a Ranger in black, run the other way. Take you out from a quarter mile off.
joy|Good to see you again, I hope you're winning some money in here.
fear|Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
surprise|Word is those tough guys rangers are here. I ain't seen them myself, but how scary can they be?
joy|Great fighting today.
anger|Wish the Followers would get me some better armor.
surprise|Isn't that Cass? I heard she'd gotten out of the caravan business.
joy|For my beard, I do as I promised.
fear|You killed him! What have we done to you?
joy|I can't imagine this place will ever disappear.
sadness|I lost everything I had at The Tops, but if you gave me 500 caps, I'd head straight back. Sick, huh?
joy|A Ranger, here in the Strip? Fine company, sir!
anger|What?
fear|It can't be! How the hell...
anger|Sorry, I'm busy right now.
fear|I'm not scared of you. Give me a good reason to call the law and, I swear, you'll regret it.
joy|Can't tell you how glad I am you butchered the Fiends. Caravans across the wastes are going to be buying you drinks for years.
disgust|If you want to talk, take off that ridiculous Legion uniform. It's insulting.
surprise|Anyone who can command Moreno and Johnson in the same unit without somebody getting fragged is one hell of a leader.
disgust|Don't listen to a word No-bark says. I don't think he ever sleeps, so it's no wonder he spouts nothing but nonsense.
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
surprise|I can't believe that President Kimball was attacked. I'm just relieved that nothing bad happened to him.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
fear|Caesar's death is good news for the NCR. For everyone, most likely.
anger|My buddies at McCarran will find the asshole that destroyed our Monorail.
fear|Looks like this is gonna be the big one, boss. If you're ready, I'm with you.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
sadness|The surface world is a cruel place.
anger|Do you have any idea how much effort it took to place a mole at McCarran who could plant that bomb on the monorail? The one you defused?
joy|Even Presidents die, huh? Good.
joy|Good riddance, Caesar! We can finally enjoy some R&R without worrying about a Legion attack at McCarran.
joy|Always good to see a friendly face, you're always welcome to visit my baby girl.
joy|We finally took back Nelson from those Legion bastards!
joy|She flew him out on over a dozen missions, including his last. I've always been close to Daisy.
joy|If it isn't the gal that saved President Kimball. We owe you a big debt of gratitude. If Kimball died, I don't know what would have happened.
anger|When the time comes, I'll be the one to kill you.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
joy|Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
anger|Why are you even talking to me?
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
joy|I owe you a huge favor for this. Here - these are technically Crimson Caravan funds, but I know they'll understand once I explain things.
anger|You belong on a cross, degenerate.
joy|I like how you handled Keene. Without the Nightkin around, Jacobstown would be much weaker than it is.
joy|It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
surprise|I've never seen so many pretty lights in my life.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
joy|I can't imagine this place will ever disappear.
anger|Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker when I find out who did it.
joy|NCR came all the way to save us, huh? Guess they missed the shit-holes.
joy|The beasts don't look so tough behind bars, huh?
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
anger|Don't listen to a word No-bark says. He spouts nothing but nonsense.
sadness|Westside, huh? I passed through here with another Follower a while back, Anderson. The locals were having a lot of trouble getting water through.
anger|I can't believe you've got the gall to stroll down the Strip after what you've done.
sadness|Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
anger|I know I talk a lot of shit about the army, but you come around here again and I'll slit you.
anger|What on earth could push you to destroy Forlorn Hope?
anger|I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
joy|One of these days, Red Lucy's going to show off her Deathclaws.
joy|That Caesar bastard had it coming.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
surprise|We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
joy|I hope you're doing well, friend!
fear|Just, don't do anything crazy.
fear|Just, don't do anything crazy.
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
fear|Word is they're sending some of us home since we're not making the quota.
anger|You've got a lot of nerves being here. Maybe you should just leave instead.
fear|You killed him! What have we done to you?
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
joy|That Caesar bastard had it coming.
fear|Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.
joy|You saved the NCR's head honcho, sure you can save a bunch of low-life scum like us.
sadness|If I don't get more water soon, I won't make my quota this season.
joy|It's cramped in here, sure, but who really needs a fancy room, anyway?
fear|Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
joy|There's nothing else like The Thorn!
sadness|Don't think I'll make it topside any time soon.
anger|Will you quit bothering me?
surprise|Great, just when you think the NCR can't possibly sink their claws deeper, the town of Primm signs up to join the Republic.
joy|Hey there, friend.
joy|My buddies at Camp McCarran are breathing easy now that the Fiends' leader is dead.
joy|You're always welcome among the Followers, friend.
joy|We can finally relax with Cooke gone.
anger|Ok, that's that. No more games for you. Go rob the Tops. You're done here.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
joy|After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
joy|We owe you so much for saving our President.
joy|Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
joy|Won't have to worry about those Fiend assholes for some time now, huh?
joy|What can I do for you?
joy|There's always more next day.
joy|Holy shit! Did you hear that Caesar is dead? Maybe we actually have a fighting chance now.
sadness|I thought I might wear it at Hoover Dam, but after you talked me out of it, I didn't see the point in hanging on to it any longer.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
joy|Did you hear? Gomorrah's under new management!
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
fear|I really don't have anything you'd want.
surprise|What on earth is *that* creature?
disgust|Don't dump your Ghoul here, we've already got enough shit around us.
joy|If you ever need the assistance of the Followers, just ask.
joy|There's always more next day.
joy|Now that you've killed that Caesar bastard, the Strip's really going to bloom!
sadness|If someone can blow up the Monorail, I guess we're not safe even in the Strip.
fear|Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
anger|You belong on a cross, degenerate.
joy|I never thought I'd see the day when the NCR and the Kings started getting along.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
fear|Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
sadness|Can you spare some caps, 'mam?
anger|Bit of a troublemaker, aren't you?
fear|Some of the other guys told me that the Legion troops eat their own dead to gain their strength, but they're kidding, right?
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
disgust|Yeah, Caesar, let's give you brain surgery in a tent. That can't possibly go wrong.
joy|It's a pleasure to see you, friend! Best of luck during your stay.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
joy|Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
fear|Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
disgust|I'm glad you decided to off one of the most powerful men in the Mojave. Life was getting boring anyways. Really.
joy|I heard you helped destroy the Legion at Nelson. Thanks!
joy|With all the people passing through lately, the town's been doing better than, well, ever.
anger|I bet I'd get a reward for bringing your head to the authorities, assassin!
fear|What do you want with me?
joy|More fights, we want more.
joy|The Followers are lucky to have a friend like you.
sadness|Can't go anywhere else.
joy|I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
sadness|Red Lucy was a fine warrior, and a beautiful woman.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
joy|Cooke left the vault, good thing too he was going to get us all killed.
disgust|Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
fear|You're not going to cause any problems, right?
anger|Enough.
joy|Hey, you're Cachino's friend. You got business with me?
sadness|We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
anger|What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
sadness|Can't help thinking that we've not seen the last of the Fiends yet.
joy|Heya baby, good to see you. Always nice to have a celebrity drop by.
sadness|He simply solved riddles because they existed.
joy|If it isn't the Ambassador's new best friend. What can I do for you?
joy|Us NCR folk got to stick together, even if the Strip is the safest place in New Vegas.
anger|Why are you even talking to me?
joy|With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
joy|I hope you're doing well, friend!
joy|We owe you so much for saving our President.
joy|I kinda like being a farmer.
anger|One of those beasts cut my friend in half! How the hell did they escape from Red Lucy?
fear|Look, I've got people to care for. I'm not looking for trouble.
surprise|Never seen a guardian dog like that before.
surprise|Whoa. New guy.
sadness|Don't think I'll make it topside any time soon.
joy|Hi there! Is this where I can pick up a laser gun?
joy|There's always more next day.
anger|The garrison I placed at Nelson served a vital strategic function. Did you think you could wipe it out and I wouldn't find out?
joy|It's good to see you around the Strip.
anger|I don't get you. Sometimes you help the Followers, and other times you work against us.
fear|People all scared of those robots on the Strip since they changed. Like who needs the Strip anyway?
joy|I can't wait to see what fights next.
fear|You're not going to cause any problems, right?
disgust|Fuck, where are we gonna get our shit from now that the Khans are all buddy buddy with the NCR.
fear|Inside the Lucky 38? Not sure whether that's a blessing or a curse.
joy|Did you hear about the Legion Defeat at Nelson? We're winning back our territories.
joy|The maize is doing well in this soil.
fear|I don't know what you have against the Followers, but I don't want any trouble.
joy|The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
anger|Beat it, or I'll call the bots on you right quick.
surprise|These bots now have eyes on their backs, I swear!
surprise|Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
fear|Uh-oh, I'll call the Securitrons if you try anything crazy with me, understand?
disgust|Damn Brahmin crap everywhere.
anger|What on earth could push you to destroy Forlorn Hope?
surprise|Killing Fire Geckos at The Thorn is no joke, you're quite the fighter!
joy|Hey there! Here's the rest of the payment I promised you back in Goodsprings.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
joy|Have you found the components we discussed? The sooner we get this over with, the better.
anger|I've got little enough patience for you. Consider your words carefully - you don't want me as an enemy.
sadness|Why do you have to harsh my mellow? Just be cool, you dig?
joy|You serve the Legion well, amicus.
anger|Hmm, join the Great Khans or die in the wasteland? Good fucking plan Cooke.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
sadness|Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
surprise|You've been making a name for yourself around here already.
joy|Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
surprise|You're the talk of the day around the casino tables.
joy|Well look who it is! Glad to have you here, buddy! What can I do for you?
surprise|Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
disgust|And if you're NCR, keep it to yourself. They're not popular around here.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
anger|Quit talking! We've got a job to do.
joy|Now that you've killed that Caesar bastard, the Strip's really going to bloom!
anger|How the hell did the monorail blow up? Someone's bringing back luck into the Strip, I tell you.
anger|You better scram before I sic the entire Strip after you.
anger|Even without our President, we won't leave the new territories!
fear|You're not going to raze us to the ground, like you did to Forlorn Hope, right?
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
joy|Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
anger|I'm not going to talk to you!
anger|You'll pay for what you did to our soldiers at Forlorn Hope, murderer!
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
anger|What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
surprise|Killing Fire Geckos at The Thorn is no joke, you're quite the fighter!
joy|Good to see you! Alive, that is. Have you found all of the components yet?
surprise|The tables turned for Mr. House. What next, huh?
joy|I like how you handled that. Nicely done.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
joy|That Caesar bastard had it coming.
fear|Caesar's death is good news for the NCR. For everyone, most likely.
joy|I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
anger|Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
joy|I bet NCR troops can't wait to clean the sewers.
disgust|Your pet ghoul smells like ass.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
surprise|Someone got Mr. House. The Strip's going to change, I'd bet on it.
anger|As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
anger|How the hell did the monorail blow up? Someone's bringing back luck into the Strip, I tell you.
joy|We owe you so much for saving our President.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
surprise|You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
joy|Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
joy|I'm glad to see you.
fear|I really don't have anything you'd want.
anger|Have you brought news of the Boomers?
joy|More reinforcements are in from Primm. Damn glad to have those guys here.
joy|House all dead, we should hit the Strip. Rip shit up.
joy|A friend of mine at the Dam says President Kimball might visit the troops out there. Imagine shaking the president's hand!
fear|Medicine's running low again.
sadness|Maybe when this is all over, they'll find time to look after us.
joy|I understand you dealt the NCR a crushing defeat at Forlorn Hope. I hope that trend continues.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
surprise|I've never seen a robot like that before.
joy|Just trimmed the Van Graff family tree, I think Freeside'll breathe a little easier now.
joy|The beasts don't look so tough behind bars, huh?
disgust|If I have to put up with another night of Private Stone's whining, I swear I'm going to strangle him.
surprise|These bots now have eyes on their backs, I swear!
fear|Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
anger|You better be sleeping with one eye open.
anger|I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
joy|Wow, look who it is! What can I help you with?
fear|House is dead, wonder if Motor-Runner will let us hit the strip now.
joy|Did you hear? Gomorrah's under new management!
joy|If you ever need the assistance of the Followers, just ask.
joy|So, our President's savior is enjoying a well deserved R&R? Fine piece of work you are!
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
anger|Even without our President, we won't leave the new territories!
sadness|But if you're here long enough, it starts to seem normal. That's what a ranger's life is now. Looking east.
joy|Ave, amicus.
surprise|I've never seen a robot like that before.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
joy|Like I said, I needed to go do something. This is it. It belonged to my father.
joy|Howdy, come try your luck? I hope's on your side.
anger|What do you need?
joy|Hey, look who it is bringing that good Khan karma around!
anger|I'm going to get some extra ammo, a few bottles of whiskey, then show them how Cassidys settle accounts.
anger|There's more of them still out there.
joy|That is one battered Eyebot. It's a miracle it's still functioning.
anger|Howdy, young lady. How can I help you? But make it quick. Goddamn heat's worse in this town than in the middle of a Brahmin herd at noon.
anger|I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
joy|I hope the Fiends stop their raids now that their boss is gone
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
surprise|You have to hand it to the NCR. Get enough hands working together and they can make or break just about anything.
sadness|If you're heading out, be careful. There's been lots of Legion raiding parties around lately.
sadness|Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
anger|Even on the brink of the final battle, you have questions?
fear|Hope you can answer them politely, or there's no safe place in the Mojave for you.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
fear|Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
surprise|The robots here look different than others I've seen.
anger|You better watch yourself around here. I'm not going to put up with any of your crazy shit.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
surprise|I heard some Squatters talking about some fancy pants Rangers coming into the area soon. Like we need more NCR here.
surprise|I suppose I can help you out. What do you want?
sadness|I heard Quartermaster Mayes sent some guys out for supplies and they never came back. I wonder if they just ran off instead.
fear|You killed him! What have we done to you?
sadness|I'm gonna miss having Anderson around.
joy|Howdy, great to see you!
joy|House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
surprise|I can't believe the King is dead. What's going to happen to us now?
joy|With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
surprise|You've taken down Cazadores! Didn't think I'd ever see that.
joy|We owe you so much for saving our President.
anger|I guess I'll wait out here, then.
joy|I never thought I'd see the day when the NCR and the Kings started getting along.
anger|I thought the dam was boring. Then they stuck us out here to watch over this scrap heap.
joy|Hey, did you track down some chlorine for me?
sadness|We'll miss Red Lucy down here.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
anger|Fuck you.
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
surprise|Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
joy|I never thought I'd see the day when the NCR and the Kings started getting along.
fear|Run! Beasts got free!
disgust|I'm sure pissing off a massive government with a huge army at its disposal was a good move. How could it not be? It was your idea.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
anger|I should make you pay for your crimes!
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
anger|Voices down, eyes up.
joy|With all the people passing through lately, the town's been doing better than, well, ever.
sadness|Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
surprise|Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
disgust|Charging a casino full of heavily-armed gangsters was a great idea, boss. Definitely not the kind of thing that could have gotten us both killed.
joy|With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
joy|Hey, It's great what you're doing for The Thorn, way to go!
anger|We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
joy|Traveling into the Strip just got a lot easier now that the Fiends' leaders are dead.
joy|Wish I could've seen you capture those beasts for our Thorn!
anger|What do you need?
joy|I've heard of your fights at The Thorn. People down here don't stop talking about you.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
sadness|I can't say that's how I would have handled that, but...
surprise|That NCR prez survived a Legion hit? Wouldn'ta guessed.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
anger|Weeks were spent convincing the Great Khans to join the Legion, but you've ruined all that. Haven't you?
joy|There's nothing else like The Thorn!
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
fear|House signing up with the NCR, you hear? Fucking sell-out.
sadness|Can't go anywhere else.
anger|What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
surprise|I hear Mr. House cashed out. Ain't much to miss.
joy|I heard you stopped the Omertas plan to attack the Strip. Good job, you're a real hero.
joy|Ave, amicus.
joy|Those Legion beasts needed to be put down, like the vermin they are!
disgust|I thought I told you to get the fuck out of here.
anger|You again? Get out here, smoothface.
joy|I bet NCR troops can't wait to clean the sewers.
anger|I've run out of witty ways to tell you to leave, so why don't you just go?
joy|Somebody whacked the NCR president. Got what was coming to him.
joy|Good to see a friend of our government.
anger|You're not exactly making friends around here, are you?
anger|I can't believe you've got the gall to stroll down the Strip after what you've done.
joy|I hope you're doing well, friend!
anger|Don't try my patience. A nod of my chin, and you'll be decorating a cross.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
fear|If House is dead, how'd the lights get turned on in his place, huh?
anger|Beat it, or I'll call the bots on you right quick.
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
joy|This has been a long time coming. The rest of the Legion better watch out.
joy|That Fiend leader got what he fucking deserved.
joy|You're back.
anger|Would I like to help infiltrate the Lucky 38? I'm so glad you asked...
joy|Mr. House won't trouble our plans for the Strip any longer, huh!?
fear|Just, don't do anything crazy.
joy|NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
anger|Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
surprise|Sounds like the NCR and the Legion are both gearing up for a fight. We've been seeing a lot more soldiers around.
joy|One of New Vegas' finest! You are always welcome in the Strip.
joy|Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
joy|You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
disgust|You are such an asshole sometimes.
joy|Hey there. Was it always your plan to sell me into slavery to Caesar, or was that a spur of the moment thing?
fear|Sure hope you know what you're doing, Mojave's getting tense.
fear|Look, I've got people to care for. I'm not looking for trouble.
joy|Thanks for bringing Cachino's transgressions to our attention. Shame we had to put him down, he was a good lieutenant.
joy|Hey, doll, how's my favorite girl? Got a kiss for me?
sadness|Those bastards got Ringo in the end, after all. At least he went down fighting.
joy|See, that wasn't so bad. Anything else I can do for you?
anger|You activated ARCHIMEDES?! What the hell are you thinking?!
surprise|The Kings got hit hard. I don't know how many of them are still alive, if any.
fear|Looks like Mr. House run out of luck, huh?
fear|Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
anger|Fucking geckos.
surprise|Hey, you're the one that's been hunting the most dangerous beasts for The Thorn!
joy|That's a true friend of this wonderful place! Lady Luck shines on you.
joy|We owe you so much for saving our President.
joy|NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
sadness|Sorry. I can't talk right now.
disgust|This is just swell - Benny vamooses and I'm left holding the bag. Whaddya need, kid?
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
sadness|This isn't really a good time. What did you want?
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
joy|Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
anger|I warned you about this. Praetorians, slaughter this degenerate!
joy|If you ever need the assistance of the Followers, just ask.
joy|When I get back home, I'll tell everyone I met you.
surprise|You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
anger|Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
joy|You're a model citizen, thank you.
joy|Stories of how you saved President Kimball are the talk of the Strip, friend!
surprise|... Huh?
surprise|Look at that - a friendly Nightkin. What's it doing here?
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
disgust|Kimball dead, maybe the NCR will learn to stay the fuck out of other people's business.
joy|It sure is nice to see everybody working together like family. Maybe now the baby Jesus won't cry his self to sleep every night.
sadness|Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
anger|What do you need?
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
fear|Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
anger|Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker if we find out who did it.
surprise|Little birdies tell me you've been to visit the Lucky 38 - not a lot of folks go in there these days.
fear|You're not going to cause any problems, right?
anger|Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
disgust|Didn't expect someone like you around here. What do you want?
joy|Hello, baby! Welcome to the Tops! What can I do for you?
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
joy|Camp McCarran is paradise compared to this place. A two-minute monorail and you're on the Strip!
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
surprise|We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
anger|Fuck that Fiend bastard. Wish I would've seen him die.
fear|What do you want with me?
anger|Wish the Followers would get me some better armor.
sadness|<whimper>
joy|Welcome. There's food and water here for any citizen of the NCR. Please, have some.
anger|I don't believe there's anything left for us to talk about.
fear|Look, I've got people to care for. I'm not looking for trouble.
anger|We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
surprise|You're the talk of the day around the casino tables.
joy|Welcome back, my friend. What can I do for you?
anger|You're an enemy of the Followers, as far as I'm concerned. I don't care how you've helped us.
fear|Holy shit! Run for your lives!
joy|A Follower is always welcome among our people.
anger|With Chomps in jail, who's going to run things at the quarry? He was our most experienced guy!
anger|Wretched Profligate. Try making some trouble.
joy|Did you hear? Gomorrah's under new management!
joy|You want to gamble with class? Hit the Ultra-Luxe, if you don't mind being serviced by masked creeps.
joy|That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
joy|Well look who it is! What can I do for you?
sadness|It's a shame what happened up here. I understand arguments about the "fog of war", but that can't be much consolation to the survivors.
anger|I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
fear|I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
anger|Even with the White Glove Society to deal with, you have questions?
fear|Is it true? The big boss ranger done killed his self?
anger|I can't believe Chomps got arrested! They said he was involving in smuggling, if you can believe it.
fear|Don't worry, boss. I'm sure the sudden tension in the air is just... a thunderstorm?
anger|Of course they'd track me. Of course they'd assume the worst. Sure, I left them. But that didn't mean I'd ever be free of them.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
fear|I don't want any trouble, okay?
fear|The Legion is assembling a massive army on the other side of the river. How can we stop an army when we can't even handle their raiding parties?
surprise|I still can't believe the King agreed to work with the NCR. But he's the King, and the King knows best.
joy|Nice work at the Tops, buddy.
sadness|Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
joy|Nice work at the Tops, buddy.
surprise|I don't know if the Scorpions deserved to be wiped out for something they didn't do, but that's one less problem Westside has to deal with.
joy|Be honest, you did it for the ticker-tape parades, huh boss?
joy|That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
joy|Lady Luck's on your side. I hope some of that rubs off on me, Caesar killer!
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
anger|Let's do this shit!
anger|I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
sadness|I wish the rest of the Vault were accessible.
anger|Razz said the candy he got us was special! I wonder what he- Gnaaah, kill, kill, rip and kill! -meant by that?
surprise|Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
joy|Shooting guns is real scary, but I think I got the hang of it now!
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
fear|Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.
surprise|Oh... Hello. I am Michael Angelo. How can I-
surprise|All hell broke loose when the creatures escaped from The Thorn!
sadness|Back again. What now?
joy|That Fiend leader got what he fucking deserved.
joy|You're a model citizen, thank you.
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
surprise|The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
disgust|They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
anger|You're just as bad as the NCR or the Legion. What did the Followers ever do to you?
surprise|Your robot looks worth quite a few caps.
joy|After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
anger|I don't have time to chat right now. If you have business, wait for me to get settled in.
joy|Well, I'll be. Hoover Dam. One of the last remaining functioning wonders of the Pre-War world.
surprise|The owner of the Vault was murdered. I thought we were safe inside the Strip.
joy|The new slave girls are quite beautiful.
joy|The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
joy|House dead, Strip can belong to anyone who wants it. Fiends to rule.
joy|You're wise to serve the Legion by choice.
joy|Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
sadness|The Strip's not a bad place if you love terrible things and people. I'll never understand the allure of giving away your money to the rich.
anger|What do you want?
surprise|A vertibird. Interesting. It's been a long time since I've seen one of these.
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
joy|Saw a monster rip a man in half at The Thorn.
surprise|Heard Chief Hanlon took the lead expressway to Angel-town. Weird shit, yo.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
joy|So I finally get to meet the courier who's caused so much trouble for the New California Republic.
surprise|I didn't know the Brotherhood had any people out here.
joy|There's nothing else like The Thorn!
joy|The Legion has won a great victory over the NCR at a place called Forlorn Hope.
anger|I don't get you. Sometimes you help the Followers, and other times you work against us.
joy|Not loyalty to the Enclave, or even the ideals they fought for, but to the people who served with him.
joy|Nice to see a friendly face around here. We don't get many visitors of your esteem. Something I can do for you?
joy|At this rate, one Securitron is going to be enough to defend the whole Strip.
anger|I should make you pay for your crimes!
fear|What do you want with me?
disgust|Look, maybe you were like this before I signed up with you, but if you keep acting this way, I'm not going to stick around much longer.
anger|Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
disgust|Kimball dead, maybe the NCR will learn to stay the fuck out of other people's business.
fear|It can't be! How the hell...
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
surprise|Look at that - a friendly Nightkin. What's it doing here?
anger|You and I have got nothing to talk about.
joy|You saved the NCR's head honcho, sure you can save a bunch of low-life scum like us.
joy|Private Sexton was thinking of having a contest to see who can kill the most Legion. I wonder if he ever got that going.
joy|Thanks for doing this, getting them all back together again.
joy|Won't have to worry about those Fiend assholes for some time now, huh?
anger|Give me cause, Profligate.
joy|I hope the Fiends have learned their lesson.
joy|Until next time.
joy|You better control thatthing. Bots can't be trusted.
anger|Go away, you big bully!
joy|You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
fear|If House is dead, how'd the lights get turned on in his place, huh?
surprise|Can you imagine how much electricity it takes to keep this Vault running?
surprise|You've been making a name for yourself around here already.
anger|We're only trying to help people, and you're not making it easy on us.
fear|Jesus. Benny's dead, and now I gotta take up the slack. This right here is the end of an era.
joy|We need more people like you around.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
joy|Going to place me a good bet at The Thorn.
anger|You'll pay for what you did to our soldiers at Forlorn Hope, murderer!
joy|One of New Vegas' finest! You are always welcome in the Strip.
sadness|The Tops is a real snooze fest. I hope they get some new shows soon.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
anger|I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
anger|I assume this is about something important? You're interrupting my research.
anger|Even without our President, we won't leave the new territories!
disgust|You're always... interesting to have around.
surprise|I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
surprise|NCR is going to be rip shit about losing their little train.
joy|But since you came in with Veronica, I'm inclined to cut you a little slack. Just behave yourself and we won't have any problems, okay?
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
fear|Run! Beasts got free!
fear|I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
fear|If I have to pull another double shift again I'm going to collapse from exhaustion.
anger|You again? You should meet my bookie, you have something in common - every time I talk to you, I lose caps!
anger|President Kimball was there on the Dam, right before you. And yet he lives. How did you fuck this up?
fear|This is it. War's almost upon us.
joy|Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
joy|We showed them a thing or two.
disgust|Take a seat on the couch please, so we can have a little talking time.
sadness|We'll miss Red Lucy down here.
surprise|I've never seen so many pretty lights in my life.
joy|That was a good day for The Thorn.
anger|Wretched Profligate. Try making some trouble.
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
anger|I can't believe Chomps got arrested! They said he was involving in smuggling, if you can believe it.
joy|The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
joy|Great fighting today.
joy|I've heard of your fights at The Thorn. People down here don't stop talking about you.
anger|I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
disgust|I'm sure pissing off a ruthless warlord with a tribe of fanatically-devoted warriors was a good move. How could it not be? It was your idea.
fear|They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
fear|I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
joy|It's cramped in here, sure, but who really needs a fancy room, anyway?
sadness|It's hard to stay awake on watch with only a few hours of sleep. I wish we actually had time to rest around here.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
anger|What do you want?
joy|Didn't you save President Kimball? You're my new hero!
surprise|God, I did this. This was my fault. Why didn't I see this coming?
surprise|I hear Mr. House cashed out. Ain't much to miss.
anger|Now that you have all you care for, please... leave, and don't come back!
surprise|Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
joy|I hope you're doing well, friend!
anger|Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
anger|I should kill you myself for what you did to Kimball, and fuck the law!
joy|The new slave girls are quite beautiful.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
surprise|If you had asked me a month ago, I'd have said we'd never willingly work with the NCR. But look at us now.
anger|Can't grow crops if they don't give us the water.
joy|Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
joy|Hey, It's great what you're doing for The Thorn, way to go!
sadness|Was hard enough to convince Keene to come up here in the first place, and you gave him an excuse to leave. Better than killing him, I guess.
sadness|We'll miss Red Lucy down here.
joy|NCR should head back to their lands, I'm sure *their* people miss them.
surprise|Glad that fucker House is gone.
anger|I should make you pay for your crimes!
surprise|I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
anger|Got time to save us too, or are you running errands for your NCR masters?
surprise|Oh, what do you want?
fear|Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
joy|It's a pleasure to see you, friend! Best of luck during your stay.
joy|With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
fear|It can't be! How the hell...
joy|House dead, Strip can belong to anyone who wants it. Fiends to rule.
joy|I'm sure you found Benny's demise pleasing. The destruction of an enemy... there are few things more satisfying.
joy|I'll get in, win big, get out. Take those winnings back home where they'll do some good!
anger|I still don't have any supplies to spare. Is there something else I can help you with?
joy|Angry soldier robots with bazookas. I'm sure they'll be a good police force.
joy|If I had to pick anyone who didn't belong in the Enclave, it would definitely be Johnson. He hated what the Enclave was doing.
joy|After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
joy|Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
surprise|I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
disgust|Gathering junk's not the most exciting work, but it's a living.
joy|Nothing like turning a snake's trap on itself. That Benny's a slippery fucker, but you one-upped him, all right.
fear|People all scared of those robots on the Strip since they changed. Like who needs the Strip anyway?
anger|I'm heading back West. You won't see me again.
joy|Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
sadness|I wish I was stationed at McCarran. I heard they still get to hit the Strip for R&R. We haven't had R&R in ages.
anger|I should kill you myself for what you did to Kimball, and fuck the law!
anger|Took you long enough. So, can I go now?
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
anger|How the hell did the monorail blow up? Someone's bringing back luck into the Strip, I tell you.
anger|Fuck that Fiend bastard. Wish I would've seen him die.
joy|I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
joy|New Vegas, paradise, my ass.
fear|Hope those Great Khans don't come trash my saloon. I'm not part of the NCR!
joy|Things are good since Cachino took over.
joy|Hey, mister, looking to relax? Looks like you carry a lot of tension in your shoulders... and upper thighs.
anger|People like you are the reason the Followers haven't brought civilization back to the wasteland yet.
fear|I'm all for live and let live, you know, but a lot of folks around here... umm... aren't.
joy|I hope Red Lucy gives us the *big* monsters, next.
joy|Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
joy|Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
fear|They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
fear|You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
joy|One of these days, Red Lucy's going to show off her Deathclaws.
joy|Did you hear? We're going to join the Great Khans.
fear|I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
joy|What can I do for you, friend?
joy|I won't be missing Mr. House, that's a given. The Strip's better off without him.
joy|I heard that Caesar was killed by his own Lieutenants. I wonder if their infighting will give us a break for a while.
disgust|Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
fear|Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
joy|You want to gamble with class? Hit the Ultra-Luxe, if you don't mind being serviced by masked creeps.
surprise|Look at that - a friendly Nightkin. What's it doing here?
joy|I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
joy|After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
joy|It's a pleasure to see you, friend! Best of luck during your stay.
anger|Save the sweettalk for when the shooting's done.
anger|I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
surprise|I've never seen a robot like that before.
joy|So I heard you helped take over Nelson from the Legion. Glad to see someone making a difference around here instead of just complaining.
fear|Just, don't do anything crazy.
surprise|Hey, you're the one that's been hunting the most dangerous beasts for The Thorn!
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
joy|Stories of how you saved President Kimball are the talk of the Strip, friend!
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
joy|I hear the Great Khans are pretty tough, I hope we can join them.
anger|Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
anger|I never trusted those Omerta punks, even if I like their girls.
joy|Great fighting today.
joy|Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
surprise|I've never seen a robot like that before.
surprise|I can't believe the King is dead. What's going to happen to us now?
anger|Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker when I find out who did it.
anger|If you've committed any other crimes, this is the time to confess them, because after today there will be no forgiveness.
disgust|Gathering junk's not the most exciting work, but it's a living.
surprise|I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
sadness|Since my mother died, Daisy's been the only woman in my life. She was the only other woman close to my father, too.
disgust|Maybe I'm just old and tired, but being locked in a cool, dark pod to sleep for a few centuries doesn't sound so bad.
fear|Don't... do anything to me, okay?
joy|You're a model citizen, thank you.
anger|Don't care about Kimball, until he starts to care about us.
surprise|I didn't know the Brotherhood had any people out here.
fear|Motor Runner dead? Who the fuck gonna run the show now?
joy|Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
anger|I should make you pay for your crimes!
disgust|Jesus, you really can't take a hint, can you?
fear|I don't know what you have against the Followers, but I don't want any trouble.
surprise|Fiends don't come here no more, they say.
surprise|What's that? Looks like a map - got the route along the West of Vegas, and...
fear|It seems like for every Legion soldier we kill, two more take his place. How many of them are there?
joy|Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
anger|Praetorians! Kill this asshole!
joy|This place smells like booze and sex. That's why I always come back.
joy|That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
anger|You're just as bad as the NCR or the Legion. What did the Followers ever do to you?
sadness|Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
surprise|Swank filled me in about Benny. Hell of a thing, baby. Hell of a thing.
joy|NCR came all the way to save us, huh? Guess they missed the shit-holes.
anger|Why are you people treating us like this?
joy|Nice work at the Tops, buddy.
joy|Welcome back! Here for another fine entertainment experience?
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
sadness|Another day, another battle, another dead trooper. When is this shit going to end?
joy|You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
joy|Howdy, come try your luck? I hope's on your side.
sadness|Like I said, I won't run out on you, but I can't let my people get dragged through the mud for this.
joy|How's my most favoritest friend?
sadness|Kimball's luck ran out.
sadness|All our work was for nothing.
joy|If you ever need the assistance of the Followers, just ask.
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
fear|I don't want any trouble, okay?
fear|I don't want any trouble, okay?
fear|The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
joy|Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
surprise|Hey, you're the one that's been hunting the most dangerous beasts for The Thorn!
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
anger|If the NCR wasn't spread so thin, maybe we could actually get some supplies and reinforcements around here.
surprise|Wish I could've seen what's inside the 38.
joy|I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
surprise|That NCR prez survived a Legion hit? Wouldn'ta guessed.
anger|Looking for trouble?
anger|We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
joy|I hope Red Lucy gives us the *big* monsters, next.
joy|House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
surprise|That's a lot of energy weapons. Brings back some interesting memories.
joy|NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
anger|We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
disgust|Those rockets over at REPCONN were the NCR's doing. Trying to keep us scared so they can stick around to "protect" us.
joy|NCR came all the way to save us, huh? Guess they missed the shit-holes.
anger|I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
surprise|A Profligate bearing the Mark of Caesar? What is the world coming to?
disgust|The Legion is torturing captive troopers in Nelson. I'd rather die fighting then be captured.
fear|Please - I'll be in trouble if the Legionaries see you speaking to me.
fear|I hope my dad doesn't find out how much money those hookers cost me.
disgust|Don't dump your Ghoul here, we've already got enough shit around us.
fear|Holy shit! Run for your lives!
anger|Bit of a troublemaker, aren't you?
anger|I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
surprise|Glad that fucker House is gone.
joy|Now that was some good work. Even got a little exciting there at the end.
joy|I kinda like being a farmer.
anger|Again you interrupt me. Why?
surprise|More of my advisors are starting to talk openly of breaking our alliance. I wonder where that idea is coming from?
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
anger|Even without our President, we won't leave the new territories!
surprise|All four of my most trusted advisors have told me we should break our alliance - maybe I should hear you out after all.
joy|You did good, putting those Omerta finks in their place. I never did trust them.
joy|I hope you're doing well, friend!
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
joy|I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
surprise|Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
sadness|I'm gonna miss having Anderson around.
joy|You're a model citizen, thank you.
joy|My lucky day, running into our President's savior!
anger|I can't believe that President Kimball is dead. If I could get my hands on the people that did this I'd rip their heads off with my bare hands.
anger|Listen up. I'm in charge of security around here, and I can't say I'm too happy having an outsider waltzing around.
anger|Take a seat on the couch over there, Nero and me want to have a little talk with you.
surprise|Glad that fucker House is gone.
joy|Lady Luck's on your side. I hope some of that rubs off on me, Caesar killer!
disgust|Are you going to help us this time, or vex us?
fear|So long as the Khans keep making it, I keep getting high.
disgust|Back again? Can I go this time, or do you have something else in mind?
anger|Why are you even talking to me?
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
fear|The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
joy|Always nice to have a friend of the NCR around. What can I help you with?
joy|I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
fear|I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
surprise|Killing Fire Geckos at The Thorn is no joke, you're quite the fighter!
joy|I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
anger|I swear, I could kill you right now and never look back.
anger|Don't make any trouble for us, we won't make any trouble for you.
joy|I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
surprise|Get moving, Profligate! Do not make Caesar wait!
anger|Hey. You're your own person and all that, but you're acting crazy, and if you keep it up, I'm going to leave.
fear|I'll be honest, when Moreno started going off, I didn't think we'd all be walking out of there in one piece.
joy|This job isn't all gunfighting and gulping shots of whiskey, no matter what the boys and ladies out there say.
fear|I hope my dad doesn't find out how much money those hookers cost me.
anger|What are you thinking? Do you want to see Vegas turned into the new slave capital of the west?
surprise|All hell broke loose when the creatures escaped from The Thorn!
fear|Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
surprise|What on earth is *that* creature?
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
disgust|Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
surprise|Isn't that Cass? I heard she'd gotten out of the caravan business.
joy|Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
joy|I felt the ground shake a while ago. I'll take that as a sign you got the job done.
disgust|Kimball dead, maybe the NCR will learn to stay the fuck out of other people's business.
surprise|Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
joy|Hi there. Sticking around Goodsprings for awhile longer?
anger|These troops did a good job holding off the Legion. Now it's time to fight back.
joy|You've proved yourself useful, at least.
disgust|Fuck, where are we gonna get our shit from now that the Khans are all buddy buddy with the NCR.
joy|It's good to see you around the Strip.
sadness|Well, that's settled... I suppose.
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
anger|You're the last person I expected to see here. What do you want?
surprise|Someone got Mr. House. The Strip's going to change, I'd bet on it.
joy|That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
anger|I should make you pay for your crimes!
surprise|I've heard about you.
joy|After I win big, I'm going to buy my friends dinner at that fancy Gor-mant restaurant. I saw ads for it back home.
joy|I hope the Fiends have learned their lesson.
surprise|Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
anger|Your organization will doom all of us.
joy|Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
fear|Just, don't do anything crazy.
surprise|Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
fear|The Khans are all gone, wonder if they left behind their shit for making our goods.
joy|I'm glad to see you.
anger|You better scram before I sic the entire Strip after you.
joy|One day I'll get to see Deathclaws tear through Fiends!
sadness|Nuclear waste disposal. Pre-War, people figured there was so much desert in Nevada, you might as well turn it into a big dumping ground.
sadness|I should've known I was beaten before I began. I just... I had to try, you know?
sadness|It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
joy|Don't know about you, but this beats herding Brahmin back in California.
joy|House unplugged like a light. Wonder if he twitched before he bit it.
joy|Stop bothering me, will ya! I won the fucking lottery!
anger|Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
joy|A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
fear|Why's that tower on the Strip all fucking lit up now, huh? I don't like it.
anger|The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
surprise|People of my trade respect the merchants of these territories.
anger|Praetorians, kill this asshole!
anger|In the future, if I become aware that you've committed other crimes, I'll have my Praetorians butcher you before my eyes.
fear|After what happened to Mr. House, nobody knows for sure what's in play for the Strip.
joy|That is one battered Eyebot. It's a miracle it's still functioning.
joy|I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
disgust|Damn Brahmin crap everywhere.
fear|That's close enough. Who are you, and what do you want with me?
joy|I really hope that incident at REPCONN doesn't drive people away. Novac was starting to do well!
sadness|Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
joy|I sure hope that explosion was you. Did you seal off the sulfur?
joy|Good to see a friend of our government.
joy|I really hope that incident at REPCONN doesn't drive people away. Novac was starting to do well!
anger|Stupid Big Horners were making noise all night again.
joy|You're back.  What's the word from Papa Khan?
anger|Are you new? No one told me about any new troops showing up. This is just great, we get new troops and no new supplies for them.
anger|I don't get you. Sometimes you help the Followers, and other times you work against us.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
surprise|More energy weapons hit this caravan. Place has been picked clean.
joy|Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
fear|I don't want any trouble, okay?
anger|Kid, you better have a good reason for waltzing back in here and not expecting us to fill you full of lead. So talk.
joy|You're always welcome among the Followers, friend.
fear|War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
anger|I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
fear|This vault gives me the creeps.
fear|Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
anger|I can't believe you've got the gall to stroll down the Strip after what you've done.
joy|You're the one who busted those assholes at Gomorrah, huh? Good work!
fear|Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
joy|With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
disgust|God, but are you ugly! Get upstairs and talk to Jason before I throw up just from looking at you.
anger|I'm on my way to my room, I don't have time to chat with you right now.
fear|Don't... do anything to me, okay?
sadness|Won't ever make enough to live outside.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
fear|I don't want any trouble, okay?
fear|We can talk after this is over!
joy|You're all set. Are we done here?
disgust|That'll teach the Powder Gangs to avoid Goodsprings in the future.
joy|Did you hear about the Legion Defeat at Nelson? We're winning back our territories.
disgust|How do they expect us to fight the Legion with only the crappy equipment and gear they gave us?
surprise|I heard Mr. House's done for. I hope the Sewers don't turn for the worse.
anger|I'd kill you right now if I could.
fear|Uh-oh, I'll call the Securitrons if you try anything crazy with me, understand?
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
surprise|The tables turned for Mr. House. What next, huh?
joy|How are you coming with the dog tags?
fear|Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
disgust|Wouldn't want to live forever if I had to look like a ghoul.
disgust|What the fuck are you looking at?
anger|Just keep on walking.
surprise|The Kings got hit hard. I don't know how many of them are still alive, if any.
sadness|Red Lucy was a fine warrior, and a beautiful woman.
fear|You're not going to cause any problems, right?
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
joy|The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
joy|With Mr. House out of the way, I can focus on smoothing out a few lingering complications elsewhere in the Mojave.
joy|Go to Benny, let him know what you've decided. My Praetorians will perform the execution - unless you want to perform it yourself.
joy|Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
joy|After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
fear|It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
anger|What makes you think I give a damn about you?
joy|Is there something else I can do for you?
surprise|And who are you to come before me... you bear the insignia of the Bear, yet you do not wear it as a soldier of the West wears it.
anger|I can't believe someone tried to assassinate President Kimball. I'm just glad he's still alive. We need a guy like him around.
disgust|Damn Brahmin crap everywhere.
surprise|The robots here look different than others I've seen.
anger|Hey, come on, lady, I'm trying to put on a show here!
surprise|Killing Fire Geckos at The Thorn is no joke, you're quite the fighter!
anger|Why don't you make like Odysseus and get lost?
disgust|Lem wants to run back to the NCR and turn himself in, spineless bastard.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
sadness|I heard the Legion veteran troops are coming to the front lines. That's the last thing we need right now.
joy|The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
joy|We neglected the dams or pumped all the water out a long time ago. Owens, Isabella, the San Luis. Drained the aquifers of everything they had.
surprise|I didn't know the Brotherhood had any people out here.
fear|Holy shit! Run for your lives!
fear|Oh, thank God! I didn't think I'd ever see another human face down here.
disgust|Wouldn't want to live forever if I had to look like a ghoul.
sadness|So, Keene's dead. Knew it might come to that some day. Makes things difficult for the town.
joy|Lem was going to turn us all in to the NCR, I'm glad he's dead.
fear|Cooke is going to get us all killed.
surprise|You've taken down Cazadores! Didn't think I'd ever see that.
fear|I really don't have anything you'd want.
anger|Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
sadness|Can't go anywhere else.
anger|We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
anger|Never been a big fan of gangs like the Fiends, boss. I'm glad they're gone.
fear|We are so fucked here! How can we ever hope to fight off the entire Legion?
joy|Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
fear|Holy shit! Run for your lives!
disgust|What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
joy|NCR should head back to their lands, I'm sure *their* people miss them.
surprise|Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
surprise|You're not one of us. What do you want?
surprise|So all of a sudden I'm hearing word that Mr. House ain't the boss of Vegas? Baby, that's just not square.
anger|Go East! they say. Scrap lying in the sun for you to grab. Yeah, right.
joy|You been to the Strip? Last time I had R&R, I left with 300 caps more than I went in. Who says the House always wins?
anger|Stay out of my way and I'll stay out of yours, got it?
anger|I should make you pay for your crimes!
fear|It can't be! How the hell...
sadness|Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
joy|NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
anger|I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
joy|When I get back home, I'll tell everyone I met you.
surprise|Don't worry, boss. I'll make sure your biography says you "heroically changed your mind" about killing the president, not "choked under pressure."
surprise|Hey, what's up?
joy|I'm glad to see you.
joy|I haven't heard a fresh batch of crazy coming out of the radio in a while. Does that mean I can leave?
fear|Primm is going to be much tougher to push around with that new sheriff down there.
joy|Sweet, those "readiness reports" are so good they actually gave me a raise!
fear|Get away from me! I don't want to get shot!
anger|Why don't you just move on to another town?
disgust|Why the hell we wandering so much anyway? Nothing against the Mojave except the dust, heat, and scorpions, but...
joy|"I bet you could stop gambling!" See Billy Knight, King of the One-Liners, LIVE at the Aces Theater! "I had amnesia once - I think!"
sadness|Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
anger|I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
joy|Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
joy|That Fiend leader got what he fucking deserved.
surprise|Wish I could've seen what's inside the 38.
surprise|Caesar's death reminds me of an old saying. I can't quite remember it now, something like "sic semper tyrannosaurus."
fear|Things are getting stranger every day.
joy|Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
anger|We're only trying to help people, and you're not making it easy on us.
anger|Got to admit, baby, I'm surprised to see you walking around like this. Figured you for persona non grata around here.
fear|Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.
joy|Hey there, pal! Welcome to the Tops, and what can I do for you today?
joy|The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
anger|Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
surprise|Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
joy|You've been doing good things for us - don't think I haven't noticed. What can I do for you?
joy|You're back. What can I do for you?
sadness|No time to talk. I have to keep watch for Legion raiding parties.
joy|The Followers are lucky to have a friend like you.
joy|I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
surprise|I didn't think anyone could kill an NCR Ranger in single combat.
joy|Until next time.
anger|How the hell did you get in here? Normally, I would have already shot you, but I'm under orders to bring you to the Elder. Will you come peacefully?
joy|The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
surprise|You've beat Night Stalkers, right? We don't see that often down here.
joy|The Followers are lucky to have a friend like you.
joy|Lady Luck's on your side. I hope some of that rubs off on me, Caesar killer!
anger|I don't work for freelancers. So move along.
fear|You're back. Find anything?
joy|The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
anger|Fuck that Fiend bastard. Wish I would've seen him die.
joy|Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
surprise|So Mr. House doesn't care that one of Caesar's most notorious Legion spies is walking around on the Strip.
sadness|There are so many refugees to care for.
anger|You find any "evidence" yet? I'm not going to wait forever.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
fear|People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
fear|I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
joy|You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
disgust|Well, the President's dead, but don't worry. History has shown that that sort of thing almost never leads to massive destabilizations or world wars.
fear|I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
surprise|It's a great honor for anyone outside the Legion to get an audience with Caesar.
surprise|I haven't seen you before - what brings you to the Great Khans?
joy|Khans are history, it serves them right!
joy|You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
anger|We're only trying to help people, and you're not making it easy on us.
joy|Hello again. Did you need something else?
joy|One day I'll get to see Deathclaws tear through Fiends!
surprise|Your robot looks worth quite a few caps.
joy|That is one battered Eyebot. It's a miracle it's still functioning.
anger|I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
anger|People like you are the reason the Followers haven't brought civilization back to the wasteland yet.
fear|Hmm. I suppose an even distribution is better than nothing.
joy|I kinda like being a farmer.
joy|Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
joy|House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
joy|I'm not surprised Kimball survived. We NCR people are made of hard stuff.
fear|You see a Ranger in black, run the other way. Take you out from a quarter mile off.
fear|If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
joy|I'm glad to see you.
joy|Won't have to worry about those Fiend assholes for some time now, huh?
anger|I warned you not to bother me!
surprise|I hear Mr. House cashed out. Ain't much to miss.
joy|Even Presidents die, huh? Good.
surprise|Isn't that Cass? I heard she'd gotten out of the caravan business.
anger|I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
surprise|People lived in here for hundreds of years, can you imagine?
fear|Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
sadness|I heard Private Stone turned himself in for stealing medical supplies. We're all stressed out here, but stealing medical supplies is low.
disgust|Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
disgust|Not to worry, boss. I'm sure killing the boss of one of the Families will in no way lead to savage, bloody reprisals against you and your loved ones.
anger|What are you looking at, huh? Answer me, or I'll get trigger-happy real quick.
disgust|I'm on my way to my office, give me a little time before you get in my face.
joy|Taking down a Giant Radscorpion, by yourself, has made you popular down here.
